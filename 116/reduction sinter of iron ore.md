## Smelting Reduction Industrial Efficiency Technology.
Smelting reduction processes are the latest development in pig iron production.These processes combine the gasification of coal with the melt reduction of iron ore.Sinter Plant Industrial Efficiency Technology & MeasuresThe purpose of the sinter plant is to process fine grained raw materials into a coarse grained iron ore sinter,ready to be charged to the blast furnace.Sintering of fine particles into a porous clinker sinter is necessary to improve the permeability of the burden,making reduction easier.A high quality sinter has high reducability.

## (PDF) STUDY ON REDUCTION KINETICS OF IRON ORE SINTER,
Sintering is the most important process where iron ore fines are converted into a suitable lumpy product for blast furnace consumption In this study,received sinter from Vizag Steel Plant,India has been used The solid state isothermal reductionReduction of Pollutant Emission in Iron Ore Sintering.For green production of iron ore sintering,it is significant to substitute fossil fuels by biomass which is a kind of clean and renewable energy.In this paper,three kinds of biomass fuels such as charcoal.KEY WORDS: biomass fuels; iron ore sintering; emissions reduction.1.Introduction Sinter is the main ferreous charge in blast.

## Reducibility of iron ore pellets and effect of additions,
AbstractThe effect of lime and silica addition on the reducibility,of sintered iron ore and synthetic hematite pellets was investigated The addition of lime and or silica (up to about 10% total) to sintered synthetic hematite pellets has little effect on the reducibility at 900&#176;C Lime additions (with or without silica) lower the reducibility of sintered hematite and magnetite ore pelletssintering of iron ore reactions myindiatour.co.inHeat transfer in the iron ore sintering bed contains very complicated modes of.reactions [2].Study of Reduction kinetics of Iron ore Pellets by.
