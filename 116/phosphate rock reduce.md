## Reduce,reuse,recycle: the future of phosphorus Soil
Let's trace the "life cycle" of a phosphorus molecule.Most phosphate rock is mined on the continents of Europe and Africa,although some deposits are available elsewhere.After it is made into fertilizer,this phosphorus is then moved to farms.From there,the phosphorus is used by a plant to make a product,perhaps a soybean.PHOSPHATE ROCK REGYP Recycling Solutions &amp GypsumPhosphate Rock is a slow release organic fertiliser and continuously adds P to the soil over a longer period of time.The benefits to farmers are lower costs and lower labour requirements because Phosphate Rock does not have to be applied every year.Rock phosphate,can mineralise the soil and improve the quality of crops and soil structure.
