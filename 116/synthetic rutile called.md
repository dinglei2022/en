## Rutile Gem5
Rutile derives its name from the Latin &quotrutilus,&quot meaning &quotred" describing the deep red color observed in some rutile crystals when viewed by transmitted light.Varieties of rutile are Venus'shair stone,fleches d'amour,and sagenitic.It has an obsolete name &quotedisonite.&quot Rutile is also called red schorl,money stone.Production of Nanosized Synthetic Rutile from Ilmenite20191126&ensp&#0183&ensprutile has encouraged research efforts to convert ilmenite into synthetic rutile for the dry chlorination process,which can be summarized into two egories,pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy methods.Pyrometallurgical production of synthetic rutile
