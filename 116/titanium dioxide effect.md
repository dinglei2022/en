## Titanium Dioxide in Foods and Cosmetics May Harm Your Brain
Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles May Harm Your Brain.The use of nanoparticles is increasing rapidly,and titanium dioxide nanoparticles are the second most produced engineered nanomaterial in the world.6 Its usage in consumer products has outpaced the research into its safety,such that humans are being repeatedly exposed before we know the consequences.Frontiers The Effect of Antibacterial and Waterproof,After many experiments,it is finally determined that hexadecyltrimethoxysilane and ethanol are mixed in a ratio of (05 1):1,and then 15% titanium dioxide is added to the mixed solution (the best antibacterial effect is achieved when the titanium dioxide mass fraction is 15%),and stir it evenly with an ultrasonic dispersion mixer to obtain an antibacterial and waterproof reagent
