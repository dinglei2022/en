## Aluminum Extrusion Process and Extrusion Terminology
Aluminum Extrusion Process Extrusion Defined.Extrusion is defined as the process of shaping material,such as aluminum,by forcing it to flow through a shaped opening in a die.Extruded material emerges as an elongated piece with the same profile as the die opening.Abstract Introduction aluminium smelter process flow chartAbstract Introduction aluminium smelter process flow chart 58774x579 #110602674972 Aluminium Recycling Process Flow Chart,with 33 Similar files.Abstract Introduction aluminium smelter process flow chart 58774x579 #110602674972 Aluminium Recycling Process Flow Chart,with 33 Similar files.

## Production process European Aluminium
Pure aluminium oxide,called alumina,is extracted from bauxite via a process called refining,composed of two steps: a digestion process,using caustic soda,which allows the separation of aluminium hydroxide from the socalled "bauxite residue",followed by a calcinationHow aluminium is producedAluminium atoms easily bind with other metals,forming compounds.At the same time it's impossible to isolate aluminium by simply melting down the compounds in a furnace,as is the case with iron,for example.The aluminium production process is much more complex and
