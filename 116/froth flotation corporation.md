The decision to use a froth flotation process creates a range of options for a mine across collectors,modifier,and frothers.One significant choice for a mine using the froth flotation process is the selection of an optimal frother to generate quality froth and to maximize the recovery of minerals and metals from ore.Froth flotation SlideShareFroth flotation 1.1 Froth Flotation Fundamental Principles Froth flotation is a highly versatile method for physically separating particles based on differences in the ability of air bubbles to selectively adhere to specific mineral surfaces in a mineral water slurry.

In this sense,mining froth can be described as an aerated slurry that either occurs naturally or,in some cases,purposely created to assist with the separation of minerals.Froth flotation is an important step used for the recovery and upgrading of sulfide ores,allowing far more economic recovery of valuable metals from much lower grade ore.US6095336A Flotation cell with radial launders forA froth flotation cell comprising a tank and an impeller rotatably disposed in the tank for suspending solids and dispersing air in a pulp phase or slurry in the tank,thereby generating froth from the pulp phase.A plurality of radially oriented launders are placed near the top of the tank and have one end connected to an outer launder adjacent the outer periphery of the tank.
