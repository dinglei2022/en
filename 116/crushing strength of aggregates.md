This paper studied the effect of aggregate properties on the crushing strength of concrete.In order to achieve the study objective,three types of coarse aggregates,brick khoa,shingles stone,and black stone were used to test.And the test results show that concrete made from black stone has the highest workability followed by shingles stone &amp; brick khoa of aggregates.Crushing strength geology BritannicaThe crushing strength of concrete,determined by breaking a cube,and often called the cube strength,reaches values of about 3 tons per square inch,that of granite 10 tons per square inch,and that of cast iron from 25 to 60 tons per square inch Read More In materials testing: Static tension and.
