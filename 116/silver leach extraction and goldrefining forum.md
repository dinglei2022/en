March 26,2010.hey another way that I have found is to use something similar to the gold refining process if you use aqua regia aka nitric and hydrochloric acid mixed it will make clora platonic acid I believe is the name and then from there you can revert the acid back to pure platinum dust witch accumulates at the bottom as a dust you then filter and wash at the very least five times withSodium Thiosulphate Gold Leaching2019127&ensp&#0183&enspThe gold industry has been seeking alternative reagents for leaching gold from lowgrade ores for the past 25 years.The cost and transport of cyanide,the poor recovery of gold from carbonaceous ores,the lack of selectivity of cyanide towards copper minerals and the cost of waste treatment are real factors which can make cyanide unattractive in some circumstances.
