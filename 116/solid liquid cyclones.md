A hydrocyclone (often referred to by the shortened form cyclone) is a device to classify,separate or sort particles in a liquid suspension based on the ratio of their centripetal force to fluid resistance.This ratio is high for dense (where separation by density is required) and coarse (where separation by size is required) particles,and low for light and fine particles.A REVIEW OF GAS LIQUID CYLINDRICAL CYCLONE (GLCC),alternatives to conventional gravity based separation The gas liquid cylindrical cyclone (GLCC) is a simple,compact,low cost separator that can provide an economically attractive alternative to conventional separators over a wide range of applications Although cyclones have long been used for liquid liquid,solid liquid,and gas solid

## Solids involved equipment processdesign
One widely used piece of solids involved equipment is the cyclone which,in its many forms,can be used to remove solids from a gas stream This case study will focus on removing soot (carbon) from the flue gas of a coal burning power plant Various carbon compounds are very common solid particles that cyclones are able to removeSolidLiquid Separation ChemTreat,Inc.Solidliquid separation programs are needed for effluent treatment to comply with discharge requirements and prevent the buildup of solids in wastewater systems.There are several methods for industrial effluent treatment,including sedimentation,straining,flotation,and filtration.

## Numerical study of liquid gas solid flow in classifying
In the present numerical model,the turbulent flow of liquid gas solid mixture is modelled by the RSM model,the interface between the liquid and air core and the particle flow are both modelled using a mixture multiphase model,as outlined in Fig.1 (Method II).The widely used LPT model (Method III in Fig.1) is also considered in this work,to be compared with the mixture model.
