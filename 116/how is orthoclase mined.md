## Feldspar 4Teachers
Plagioclase feldspar includes oligoclase and anorthite.Potassium feldspar includes microcline and orthoclase.Both types of feldspar are mined in Italy,Turkey,and China.Feldspar can also be found in the United States,or more specifically North Carolina.The colors of feldspar are mainly pink,white,colorless,gray,or brown.Microcline WikipediaMicrocline may be chemically the same as monoclinic orthoclase,but because it belongs to the triclinic crystal system,the prism angle is slightly less than right angles hence the name &quotmicrocline&quot from the Greek &quotsmall slope.&quot It is a fully ordered triclinic modifiion of potassium feldspar and is dimorphous with orthoclase.
