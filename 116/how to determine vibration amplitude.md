## How is Machine Vibration Described? Reliabilityweb: A
2019129&ensp&#0183&enspHow is Machine Vibration Described? By watching,feeling,and listening to machine vibration,we can sometimes roughly determine the severity of the vibration.We may observe that certain kinds of machine vibration appear 'rough',others 'noticeable',and yet others 'negligible'.Vibration amplitude is thus an indiion of the severityMeasuring Vibration (br0094) Br&#252el &amp Kj&#230r201669&ensp&#0183&enspVibration signals in practice usually consist of very many frequencies occuring simultaneously so that we cannot immediately see just by looking at the amplitudetime pattern,how many components there are,and at what frequencies they occur.These components can be revealed by plotting vibration amplitude against frequency.
