## Patent US1554216 Froth flotation concentration of ores Google.
This invention relates to the froth flotation concentration of ores,and isherein described as applied to the concentration of certain ores with mineral frothing agents.A&#39; Chinese graphite ore containing 49% carbon as graphite,chiefly in amorphous state,ground to mesh,was agitated ten minutes with 0.2 pounds potassium&nbsp;.Floatability study of graphite ore from southeast. AIP PublishingAbstract.Graphite ore obtained from Kolaka Regency,South East Sulawesi,Indonesia have been succesfully investigated for beneficiation by froth flotation technique.Preliminary study have been done to determine the minerals types,fixed carbon content and liberation size of the graphite.Graphite is naturally floatable&nbsp;.

## development and validation of graphitic carbon analysis of graphite.
The evaluation of a graphite deposit inevitably involves the determination of graphitic carbon content in the ore.This work consisted in a detailed assessment of the method for the determination of this element in graphite ore samples using a process,which involves acid leaching,calcination,combustion and infrared&nbsp;.Banking on future demand for graphite and graphene,Australian.20 Jul 2015.Australian companies are searching high and low for new graphite deposits,and their hunt is seeing old mines reopen from Port Lincoln to northern Sweden.The company recently announced it had commenced trial mining,and had a patent pending for the unique method of ore extraction it was using.
