Electromagnetic Separation Of Or The ore which can be attracted by the magnetic field can be concentrated by the process of magnetic separationAmong the ores mentioned in table 61,the ores of iron such as haematite (fe 2 o 3),magnetite (fe 3 o 4),siderite (feco 3),and iron pyrites (fes 2) can be separated by the process of magnetic separation8: Magnetic Ore separator 10 Inventions by Thomas Edison,Probably the biggest financial failure of Edison's career was the magnetic ore separator The idea,which Edison's laboratory experimented with during the 1880s and 1890s,was to use magnets to separate iron ore from unusable lower grade or This would mean that abandoned mines could be profitable.
