## How to size a rack and pinion drive Linear Motion Tips
Sizing a rack and pinion drive involves calculating the force the rack sees,the torque the pinion sees,and the rotational speed of the pinion.such as the pinion,gearbox,motor,etc.(kg,lbm) g = gravitational constant (9.81 m s 2,32.2 ft s 2) μ = coefficient of friction of guide mechanism (typically 0.002 toRack and Pinion Gear &amp Drives Rack and PinionThe Rack and Pinion System is the primary building block of a linear axis drive.This system consists of a standard range of straight (spur),circumferential pitch,and helical racks and pinions.The modular design permits rack segment lengths from 0.5 to 2 meters to be linked together end to end achieving any desired travel length from standard components.

## Linear Motion by Rack and Pinion: 8 Steps (with Pictures)
First,attach a servo motor on the body part (part #1).You can use either hot glue or duct tape.I used duct tape here.Then make a pinion gear by attaching two layers of gear parts with a motor part (the servo "horn" that came with the motor package).After the glue has set,connect the pinion gear to the motor on the body.Advantages of a rear hub motor GO SwissDriveSecondly,the weight distribution is ideal.The centre of gravity is on the drive wheel,which is particularly beneficial for handling trikes on steep slopes and soft ground.So our decision to opt for a rear wheel hub motor is entirely logical,and GO SwissDrive is definitely our first choice.

The pinion gear on the motor drives a spur gear,which seconds as the vehicles differential and is mounted directly (hence the name direct drive) to the axle.The final drive ratio of this type of vehicle is 1:1 (one revolution of "transmission" equals one revolution of the wheels) so as an effect of this,these types of cars are very fast.What are rackandpinion sets? Technical summary.so that a rackandpinion set may cost half of what a linear motor costs,especially for manymeter strokes.Rackandpinion sets sometimes perform better than ballscrew actuators because they're not affected by adjacent bearings,couplings,or bores they're also immune to stiffness degradation,even over long lengths.
