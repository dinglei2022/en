## Influence of ball milling and annealing conditions on the.
Influence of precursor NaCl ratio and ball milling time on particle size was investigated.Transmission electron microscopy images revealed that smaller precursor NaCl ratio (10 mg 20 g) and longer milling time (15 h) lead to smaller particle size and narrower size distribution.Milling time does not influence the coercivity much but the decr.Feed Size VS Ball Size Grinding & Classification.A ball diameter that grabs the particle must exceed the particle by 25 times to achieve this semi self locking taper.One can argue the f50 is a more realistic value since balls wear and the average ball size might be closer to half the maximum.Then the multiple would be closer to 13 times the maximum particle size fed to the ball mill.
