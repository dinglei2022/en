## concrete What water:cement:sand ratio gives the,
A ratio by weight of 05 water,1 cement,3 sand,and 3 gravel should make a fine concrete,although a little less water (04 by weight) would make stronger concrete The same by volume ( ie buckets) is a good ratio as well,1 2 to 1 to 3 to 3 (or a little less water too much water weakens the concrete,and there will always be some water.Concrete Mix Ratios for Making Bricks with MouldsHow To Work Out The Concrete Mix For Your Mould,Assume the mix ratio required is 1:2:3 (one part cement to two parts sand to three parts stone six parts in total (all mixes are printed on a pocket of cement),The volume of water required varies a lot depending on size and type of sand,stone and cement used Your material might.
