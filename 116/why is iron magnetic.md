ReferenceIron is magnetic except when heated to the Curie point.The Curie point,which is sometimes called the Curie Temperature,is the temperature at which some magnetic materials undergo a major change in their structure.The Curie point for iron is 1,418 degrees Fahrenheit or 770 degrees Celsius.

## Why Is Iron the Best Core for an Electromagnet? Sciencing
Iron is widely regarded as the best core for an electromagnet,but why? It isn't the only magnetic material,and there are plenty of alloys such as steel that you might expect to be used more in the modern age.Why is iron magnetic? Yahoo Answers2010311&ensp&#0183&enspAs soon as the magnet goes away,heat starts to randomize the spins again and pretty soon the iron is no longer magnetized at all.As far as why iron in particular does this and not most other metals,I believe it has something to do with the electronic structure of the atom and the metal crystal.Iron has 1s2s2p3s3p filled and 4s2 and 3d6

## Why is iron attracted to a magnet,but chromium isn't
The explanation I've always gotten is,roughly,'well,in chromium each atom pairs with another atom,cancelling out the magnetic field' (i.e.antiferromagnetism) but this leaves a lot to be desired.Why do such pairings form in chromium but not in iron?

Rust (a collection of some iron oxides: ) is virtually nonmagnetic,unlike plain iron or most types of steel.If the sheet metal on your car has really rusted through,there will be almost no magnetic force between it and the magnetized screwdriver.It sounds like those spots should be patched,since that's not just a thin surface layer of rust.MAGNETIC TESTING OF STRUCTURE OF THE CASTIRON201089&ensp&#0183&enspDiversity of the castiron structures leads to a great number of tasks and methods for the structural testing.The aim of this work is to generalize the basic principles of magnetic testing of structure of the castiron products.Magnetic testing of castiron products is based on the differences in magnetic properties of structural

Yes,iron is a magnetic material.It is an element by itself by alloys containing iron would also exhibit varying degrees of magnetism.The other magnetic elements include cobalt and nickel.Why is iron magnetic but copper is not? : chemistryIron has a relatively large number of unpaired electrons in its valence shell with parallel spins to each other,which creates a unidirectional magnetic field.Whereas copper's valence shell features mostly paired electrons with their opposite spin and only one unpaired in the 4S spot.

## Not All Iron Is Magnetic (Magnetic Elements)
Iron isn't the only element that displays magnetism.Nickel,cobalt,gadolinium,terbium,and dysprosium are also ferromagnetic.As with iron,the magnetic properties of these elements depends on their crystal structure and whether the metal is below its Curie point.αiron,cobalt,and nickel are ferromagnetic,while γiron,manganese,and chromium are antiferromagnetic.Why is iron magnetic and wood not? Yahoo Answers20061016&ensp&#0183&enspBut the atoms all orbit the neucleus in the same direction,and one of the fundimental laws of electromagnetics is that an orbiting charge causes a magnetic field.Thus the Iron atoms act like little tiny magnets,and if you put them in a magnetic field (by putting a magnet against them) the atoms will line up so that a big magnetic field is made.
