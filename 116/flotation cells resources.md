## Automated flotation control at Jim Walter Resources
Flotation,unlike most processing equipment,keeps most of its activity and a lot of its chemistry under a bed of froth in the cells.there are many operating variables that are constantly changing,and Management,no matter how responsive they are,cannot react quickly enough.Flotation Yarar Major Reference Works Wiley OnlineThe full text of this article hosted at iucr is unavailable due to technical difficulties.

## Flotation Technology Advances Coal Age
Jun 24,2011&nbsp&#0183&#32Column flotation cells are typically arranged in a parallel circuit where each unit receives an equal proportion of feed slurry.The mechanical cells will achieve a higher coal recovery for a given set of operating conditions since the multistage "celltocell" circuity reduces the unwanted shortcircuiting of feed to tailings.Flotation Tank Cells Metallurgist &amp Mineral Processing2019122&ensp&#0183&enspTable of ContentsBubble Particle ContactFroth HandlingOutokumpu HG Flotation CellThe "Virtual Column" Concept The use of tank cells over the years has provided a means for low cost,space efficient,extra capacity in existing flotation circuits.In some cases,new plants have selected tank cells as the machine of choice.Typical tank cells use high efficiency impellers for mixing,which

## A review of the effect of water quality on flotation
The effect of water quality variation on flotation can be negative or positive.• Strategies to deal with the effect include internal and external solutions.• Research gaps and future directions are identified through developing a framework.• Water quality variation should be managed as a risk management exercise.Jameson cell WikipediaThe Jameson Cell is a highintensity froth flotation cell that was invented by Laureate Professor Graeme Jameson of the University of Newcastle (Australia) and developed in conjunction with Mount Isa Mines Limited (&quotMIM" a subsidiary of MIM Holdings Limited and now part of
