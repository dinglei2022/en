## DENSITY RELATED PROPERTIES OF CONCRETE MASONRY,
Concrete masonry unit speciﬁcations typically establish upper limits on the amount of water permitted to be absorbed Expressed in pounds of water per cubic foot of concrete (kilograms of water per cubic meter of concrete),these limits vary with the density classiﬁcation of the unit,as shown in Table 1Density of Cement,mortar in 285 units and referenceCement,mortar weighs 2.162 gram per cubic centimeter or 2 162 kilogram per cubic meter,i.e.density of cement,mortar is equal to 2 162 kg m&#179.In Imperial or US customary measurement system,the density is equal to 135 pound per cubic foot [lb ft&#179],or 1.25 ounce per cubic inch [oz inch&#179].
