## Nickel: smelting,producingMetalpedia
Nickel is recovered through extractive metallurgy: it is extracted from its ores by conventional roasting and reduction processes that yield a metal of greater than 75% purity.In many stainless steel appliions,75% pure nickel can be used without further purifiion,depending on the composition ofNickel Sulfide Ores and Impact Melts ScienceDirectNickel Sulfide Ores and Impact Melts: Origin of the Sudbury Igneous Complex presents a current state of understanding on the geology and ore deposits of the Sudbury Igneous Complex in Ontario,Canada.As the first complete reference on the subject,this book explores the linkage between the processes of meteorite impact,melt sheet formation,differentiation,sulfide immiscibility and metal
