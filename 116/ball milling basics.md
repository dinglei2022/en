## Ball mill Wikipedia
2019112&ensp&#0183&enspThe general idea behind the ball mill is an ancient one,but it was not until the industrial revolution and the invention of steam power that an effective ball milling machine could be built.It is reported to have been used for grinding flint for pottery in 1870.Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process Control2012710&ensp&#0183&enspthe milling process takes place during rotation as a result of the transfer of kinetic energy of the moving grinding media into the grinding product.The design of a ball mill can vary significantly depending on the size,the equipment used to load the starting material (feeders),and the system for discharging the output product.
