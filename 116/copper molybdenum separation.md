## Progress on Copper
Coppermolybdenum ore is generally subjected to bulk flotation process,followed by coppermolybdenum separation through the depression of copper sulfide.However,conventional chalcopyrite depressants have the disadvantages of poor selectivity,large dosage and serious environmental pollution.Flotation separation of copper molybdenum sulfides usingChitosan,a natural biodegradable polymer,was studied as a selective depressant in copper molybdenum sulfide separation by flotation.Although chitosan depressed both molybdenite and chalcopyrite in single mineral flotation,selective flotation was achieved during the flotation of molybdenumbearing copper sulfide concentrate at pH 6 the recovery of molybdenum in the froth
