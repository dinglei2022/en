Silo Hopper Design Calculation methods 11 Why it is important Powder has a given ability to slide and fall when it is stored in a hopper A key variable that will have an impact on the flow of product outside of a bin is its cohesive strength In a bin,the powder is submitted to pressure,due to the fact that there is a height of powder in.An analytical hopper design method for cohesive powders,This relationship has remained the basis of design for vertical sided silos until the present day In 1929 Ketchum' applied the same principles to hopper design for free flowing granular materials,but his method did not hold for cohesive powders,and little further progress was made until 1961 when Jemke3 published his major work
