Acidity itself is a problem to the environment,but because the ore elements,such as copper or lead,are more soluble in acidic water than neutral water,ARD is also typically quite rich in metals,many of which are toxic.Figure 20.12 The tailings pond at the Myra Falls Mine on Vancouver Island.Lead: smelting,producing and classifiionMetalpediaThe majority of the deposits are mixtures of minerals,hence lead ore is usually obtained as a byproduct of other metal mining such as zinc,silver or copper.In fact,lead ore is a main source of silver and contributes substantially towards the world's total output.The most common lead ore is galena (PbS),which contains 86.6% lead.
