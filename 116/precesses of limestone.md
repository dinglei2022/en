## Origin of Limestone Caves Institute for Creation Research
INTRODUCTION A cave is a natural opening or cavity within the earth,generally extending from the earth's surface to beyond the zone of light.Three generic classes of caves can be recognized according to the major sculpturing process: (1) caves formed by pressure or flow,(2) caves carved by erosion,and (3) caves dissolved by solution.All About Limestone Waitomo Caves Discovery CentreAll about Limestone Limestone is one of the most common types of rock found on the surface of the Earth.About 10% of the land surface of our planet is made of limestone or similar types of rock; while around 25% of the world’s population either live on or take their water from limestone.It is thought that 50% of all our oil and gas reserves.
