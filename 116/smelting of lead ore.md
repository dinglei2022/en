## Lead smelting Wikipedia
Galena,the most common mineral of lead,is primarily lead sulfide (PbS).The sulfide is oxidized to a sulfite (PbSO3) which thermally decomposes into lead oxide and sulfur dioxide gas.(PbO and SO2) The sulfur dioxide (like the carbon dioxide in the example above) is expelled,and the lead&nbsp;.Lead smelting&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Lead processing,preparation of the ore for use in various products.Lead (Pb) is one of the oldest metals known,being one of seven metals used in the ancient world (the others are gold,silver,copper,iron,tin,and mercury).Its low melting point of 327 C (621 F),coupled with its easy castability and softness and malleability,make lead and lead alloys especially suitable for a wide range.

## Shropshire Lead Smelting Shropshire History
Smelting is the process whereby lead ore (galena) is heated until it melts at 327°C.The sulphur comes off as fumes of sulphur dioxide and the molten lead metal flows into moulds called “pigs”.Smelting has been carried out in Shropshire since at least Roman times and it is recorded that Roman smelting sites called “boles”&nbsp;.Bullion production in imperial China and its significance for sulphide.Here we present a reconstruction of a previously undocumented technology used to recover gold,silver and lead at the site of Baojia in Jiangxi province,China dated between the 7th and 13th centuries AD.Smelting a mixture of sulphidic and gossan ores in a relatively low temperature furnace under mildly reducing&nbsp;.

## What Is Lead Smelting? (with picture) wisegeek
2019714&ensp&#0183&enspAncient smelting was done using loads of lead ore and charcoal in outdoor hearths and furnaces.Highgrade ores such as galena had to be used to recover sufficient quantities of lead.The pure,molten lead flowed from the smelters,forming slabs of raw lead for later use.Lead SmeltingThe PSD shows the problem in attempting to produce lead in a single step.The volatility of PbS and PbO make it desirable to keep the gas volume as low as possible (i.e.use pure O 2 in smelting).But this means operating along the pSO 2 =1 isobar,thus producing a large amount of PbO containing slag in order to produce a low sulfur bullion.Producing a low sulfur bullion requires the use air.

## LEAD AND ZINC PRODUCTION The Handbook of Texas Online.
15 Jun 2010.In 1901 and 1902 a small smelter at Shafter produced lead from ore obtained at the Chinati Mine in Presidio County.Between 1911 and 1917 mines in the Trans Pecos produced small quantities of zinc,and in 1915 and 1916 there was some lead production in connection with silver in that region.
