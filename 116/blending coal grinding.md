## Optimization of coal blending process control based on …
By establishing a stable model of coal blending,the accuracy of coal blending is improved,which provides a theoretical reference for coal blending process.Li Yonghua [ 28 ] studied the combustion mode of blended coal,tested 640MJ H grinding system and exhaust gas online analysis system,and explained the control treatment methods of exhaust gas,cinder and some blended coal.Grinding characteristics of coal and petroleum …It was also observed that increasing coal petcoke blend ratio beyond 5.0% leads to a decrease in −200 mesh size generation.The better performance could be achieved at the blending ratio of 5%,perhaps resulting from the synergistic effect of the blends.

## Coal blending
Coal blending is the process of mixing coals after coal has been mined to achieve quality attributes that are desirable for the coal’s intended application (e.g.steam generation,coking).The quality attributes that are most important in blending will differ from one mine site to another and also depend on how the coal seams vary in quality and their final intended use.coal grinding principlesNonlinear coal mill modeling and its application to model Mar 01,2013 The present focuses on vertical spindle roller pressure coal mills,which are one of the most common arrangements for coal grinding The ing principles of these mills are extensively explained in.
