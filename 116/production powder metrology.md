## Characterization of Metal Powders Used for Additive.
 · Metrology methods used for powder characterization in this paper and their associated measurands.The powder is consistent across the production lot (e.g.the samples from distinct nominally identical containers for both CoCr and 17 4 SS.) The characteristics considered wereThe metallurgy and processing science of metal additive,laser powder bed hardware for metal production (SLM Solutions,Concept Laser,Renishaw,3D Systems) Shortly after SLS was patented,a group of researchers at MIT patented a process called ‘three dimensional printing’,which used inkjet printing to deposit binder

## Economic considerations for powder metallurgy structural parts
Production quantity requirements Powder Metallurgy requires large production runs in order to be viable Firstly,the required forming tooling is generally complex and relatively expensive and the tooling cost needs to be amortised over a large number of products Similarly,the capital costs of PM processing equipment (presses,furnaces) are.
