## AMIT 135: Lesson 5 Crushing Mining Mill Operator Training
The purpose of the primary crusher is to reduce the ROM ore to a size amenable for feeding the secondary crusher or the SAG mill grinding circuit.The ratio of reduction through a primary crusher can be up to about 8:1.Feed: ROM up to 1.5 m; Product: 300mm (for transport) to 200mm (for SAG mill) Feed Rate: 160 to 13,000 tphImpact Crusher Working PrincipleStarting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them.Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic.An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).
