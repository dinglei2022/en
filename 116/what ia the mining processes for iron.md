## Extraction Process of Aluminium from Bauxite Ore
2019728&ensp&#0183&enspAluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust and is a constituent of many minerals.However,the material which is highest in aluminum and most free from objectionable impurities is bauxite which,therefore,is practically the only source of the metal under present processes.Bauxite is the general name given to the hydrated oxides of aluminum.What Is Oxidation? Definition and Example ThoughtCoThe iron is said to have oxidized into rust.The chemical reaction is: 2 Fe + O 2 → Fe 2 O 3.The iron metal is oxidized to form the iron oxide known as rust.Electrochemical reactions are great examples of oxidation reactions.When a copper wire is placed into a solution that contains silver ions,electrons are transferred from the copper
