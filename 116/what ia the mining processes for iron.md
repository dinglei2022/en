## What Does a Mining Engineer Do? Learn
20121011&ensp&#0183&enspWhat Does a Mining Engineer Do? Mining engineers use engineering principles,technology,and scientific theory to extract natural resources,according to the Colorado School of Mines.Mining engineers oversee both mining operations and miners and are employed by many miningMining of Iron Ores IspatGuruThe most predominant surface mining methods used for mining of iron ores are open pit mining methods and open cut mining methods.However a few underground iron ore mines are also in operation around the globe.The decision for employing surface mining or underground mining is dependent on the proximity of the ore body to the surface.

## Extraction Process of Aluminium from Bauxite Ore
2019728&ensp&#0183&enspAluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust and is a constituent of many minerals.However,the material which is highest in aluminum and most free from objectionable impurities is bauxite which,therefore,is practically the only source of the metal under present processes.Bauxite is the general name given to the hydrated oxides of aluminum.What Is Oxidation? Definition and Example ThoughtCoThe iron is said to have oxidized into rust.The chemical reaction is: 2 Fe + O 2 â†’ Fe 2 O 3.The iron metal is oxidized to form the iron oxide known as rust.Electrochemical reactions are great examples of oxidation reactions.When a copper wire is placed into a solution that contains silver ions,electrons are transferred from the copper
