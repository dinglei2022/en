## Coal in a Nutshell ThoughtCo
Coal geologists study their subject the same way that other geologists study other rocks.But instead of talking about the minerals that make up the rock (because there are none,just bits of organic matter),coal geologists refer to the components of coal as macerals.There are three groups of macerals: inertinite,liptinite,and vitrinite.Coal,Minerals &amp Iron ore Collateral ServicesCoal,minerals and iron ore have many important uses worldwide,with the most significant in electricity generation,steel production,cement manufacturing and as a liquid fuel.Thermal coal is used in power stations to generate electricity,where coking coal and iron ore
