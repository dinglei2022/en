## Slag Behavior in Gasifiers.Part I: Influence of Coal
Char ash properties,gas compositions in the gasifier,the gasifier wall structure,fluid dynamics,and plant operating conditions (mainly temperature and oxygen carbon ratio) all affect slagging behavior.Because coal has varying ash content and composition,different operating conditions are required to maintain the slag flow and limitUnderstanding Coal Power Plant Heat Rate and EfficiencyFuel,operations,and plant design all affect the overall heat rate and carbon emissions of a power plant boiler.Improving coal efficiency will help financially

## Slagging and Fouling in Coal Fired Boilers
Coal fired boilers experience deposition and slagging depending upon the ash characteristics of ash in the coal being fired.In many cases the operating.1.1 Bituminous And Subbituminous Coal CombustionBituminous coals are by far the largest group and are characterized as having lower fixed carbon and higher volatile matter than anthracite.The key distinguishing characteristics of bituminous coal are its relative volatile matter and sulfur content as well as its slagging and agglomerating characteristics.
