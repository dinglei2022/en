## Effect of Flue Gas Treatment on the SpringerLink
Abstract.Studies were conducted to examine the effect of flue gas carbon dioxide (CO 2) on solubility and availability of different metals in fly ash of Powder River Basin (PRB) coal,Wyoming,USA.Initial fly ash (control) was alkaline and contains large amounts of watersoluble and exchangeable metals.Flue Gas Desulphurization Plant at 600 MW Unit 6 in theFlue Gas Desulphurization Plant at 600 MW Unit 6 in the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant Construction of the largest Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) Plant in Slovenia is a reference project,opening the door to RUDIS for construction of this type of plants also in the future.
