## Separation of oil,water and gas.
3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Three phase separators,sometimes called free water knockouts,are used to separate and remove any free water phase that may be present.Because the flow stream enters a three phase separator either directly from a producing well,or from another separator operating at a higher pressure,the vessel must be designed to separate any gas that flashes from the liquid as well as the oil and …Production Separators Drilling Equipment,TrailersDragon separators are built to operate 24 7 under the most demanding production conditions.Each unit is engineered and manufactured to the highest standards to deliver severeduty performance and help you reduce Lease Operating Expense at shale plays and oilfields across North America.
