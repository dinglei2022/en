## An electrochemical study of gold leaching in thiosulfate
The most common method of extracting gold from its ores is by leaching with an aerated alkaline cyanide solution,a process which is generally called cyanidation.There are many advantages of cyanidation over other extraction processes,including its simplicity,rapid leaching kinetics,and ease of gold recovery.KEYNOTE: HPGR in Gold Leach Appliions an Overview2019129&ensp&#0183&enspRethinking the standard approach of leaching gold ores with new HPGR flowsheet and process concepts may actually achieve metallurgical results thus far believed to be out of reach.The concept of desliming prior to leaching,which was advoed by Herkenhoff and Dean in 1987,has become of considerable significance with the use of HPGR.
