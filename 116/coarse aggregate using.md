## Coarse Aggregate: Definition &amp Density Video &amp Lesson
Coarse aggregate is also described by its bulk density,which is a property that can easily be tested in the laboratory.The standard testing procedure for this is the American Society of TestingAggregate in Concrete The Concrete NetworkEconomy is another reason for thoughtful aggregate selection.You can often save money by selecting the maximum allowable aggregate size.Using larger coarse aggregate typically lowers the cost of a concrete mix by reducing cement requirements,the most costly ingredient.
