Insmart Bond's BallMill Work Index is a measure of the resistance of the material to grinding in a ball mill.This Index is widely used in the industry for comparing the resistance of different materials to ball milling,for estimating the energy required for grinding and for ball mill scaleup.An alternative energy size relationship to that proposedThese included single stage AG SAG milling,AG SAG milling followed by ball pebble milling and rod ball milling.They concluded that,regardless of how the circuit was configured,the overall power consumption remained the same within the limits of data accuracy,i.e.the energy efficiency of AG SAG mills and ball mills was similar.
