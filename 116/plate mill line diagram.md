## Steps in the Modern Steelmaking Process
Methods for manufacturing steel have evolved significantly since industrial production began in the late 19th century.Modern methods,however,are still based on the same premise as the original Bessemer Process,which uses oxygen to lower the carbon content in iron.Hot Rolling Mill Hydraulic Gap Control (HGC) thickness2015114&ensp&#0183&enspP.Kucsera et al.Hot Rolling Mill HGC Thickness Control Improvement 94 load between passes,and for accurate positioning during rolling two hydraulic cylinders are installed.The position of the cylinders is controlled by servo valves

## Corrosionpedia What is a Reversing Mill? Definition
A reversing mill is a rolling mill in which the workpiece is passed forward and backward through a pair of rolls.The reversing mill is so named because the steel runs back and forth between the rollers,reducing the thickness incrementally with each pass.Introduction to Iron and Steel Texas A&ampM University200815&ensp&#0183&enspIntroduction to Iron and Steel A few definitions and general descriptions are in order Pig iron: Raw iron,the immediate product of smelting iron ore with coke and limestone in a blast furnace.Pig iron has a very high carbon content,typically 45%,which makes it very brittle and not very useful directly as a material.A Selection of Mechanical
