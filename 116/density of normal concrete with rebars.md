## Reinforced concrete Wikipedia
20191212&ensp&#0183&enspReinforced concrete (RC) (also called reinforced cement concrete or RCC) is a composite material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility.The reinforcement is usually,though not necessarily,steel reinforcing bars and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before theConcrete Driveway Construction Thickness,Rebar & More,Apr 07,2020&#0183;&#32;Thickness is the major factor (even more than the strength of the concrete) in determining a driveway's structural capacity Place concrete at a minimum thickness of 4 inch Increasing the thickness from 4 inches to 5 inches will add approximately 20% to your concrete cost,but will also boost your driveway's load carrying capacity nearly 50%.
