## Plant nutrition
Plant nutrition is the study of the chemical elements and compounds necessary for plant growth,plant metabolism and their external supply.In its absence the plant is unable to complete a normal life cycle,or that the element is part of some essential plant constituent or metabolite.This is in accordance with Justus von Liebig's law of the.31.1C: Essential Nutrients for Plants Biology LibreTextsAn essential nutrient required by the plant in large amounts is called a macronutrient,while one required in very small amounts is termed a micronutrient.Missing or inadequate supplies of nutrients adversely affect plant growth,leading to stunted growth,slow growth,chlorosis,or cell death.
