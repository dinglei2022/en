Pyrite (FeS 2) is the most common sulfide mineral in coal and a major source of the sulfur in coal.Pyrite can form in peat while the peat is accumulating,or can form in peats from the introduction of sulfate (SO 4) into the peat if the peat was buried by marine waters (such pyrite is called syngenetic or authigenic pyrite).Within the buried peat,the sulfate is reduced to sulfide (S 2),whichAnalysis of dielectric heating and conductive cooling of1980630&ensp&#0183&enspElectrical and thermal properties of pyrite and coal were used to obtain a theoretical analysis of dielectric heating and conductive cooling of pyrite in coal.The results were used to establish radiation levels required to produce pyritecoal temperature differentials in solid coals.The objective
