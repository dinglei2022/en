## How Is Gold Extracted From Gold Ore? Sciencing
Gold is usually found alone or alloyed with mercury or silver,but can also be found in ores such as calaverite,sylvanite,nagyagite,petzite and krennerite.Most gold ore now comes from either open pit or underground mines.The ores sometimes contain as little as 5 100 of an ounce of goldExtracting Gold HowStuffWorks2009223&ensp&#0183&enspRemoving the goldbearing rock from the ground is just the first step.To isolate pure gold,mining companies use a complex extraction process.The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces.At a mill,large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to
