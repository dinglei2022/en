## Huntsman Tioxide TR92 Quote Request Chloride Process
Huntsman Tioxide TR92 is a multipurpose grade of rutile titanium dioxide which has been designed to give optimum properties over a broad range of appliions.Tioxide TR92 is particularly suitable for use in interior and exterior coating appliions.It is easilyEffects of titanium dioxide on the flammability and charEffects of titanium dioxide on the flammability and char formation of waterbased coatings containing intumescent flame retardants.(XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).The relationship between charring process and melt flow rate (MFR) of siliconeacrylate was also discussed.It is suggested that MFR value can
