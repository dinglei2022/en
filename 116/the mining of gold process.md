2019126&ensp&#0183&enspYet mining the ore is just one stage in a long and complex gold mining process.Long before any gold can be extracted,significant exploration and development needs to take place,both to determine,as accurately as possible,the size of the deposit as well as how to extract and process the ore efficiently,safely and responsibly.How Is Gold Extracted From Gold Ore? SciencingGold is usually found alone or alloyed with mercury or silver,but can also be found in ores such as calaverite,sylvanite,nagyagite,petzite and krennerite.Most gold ore now comes from either open pit or underground mines.The ores sometimes contain as little as 5 100 of an ounce of gold

The Clean Mining gold recovery process,developed by Australia's CSIRO,replaces cyanide with a safer,less hazardous chemical reagent.This alternative chemical reagent contains thiosulphate and dissolves fine gold out of ores into a solution,which can then be recovered through further processing.Ore processing Waihi GoldThe slurry that remains after this process has a very fine particle size.Typically,80% of the ore particles are less than 70 microns in size (about the same consistency as fine beach sand).Such a fine particle size is required for gold liberation the size required for the cyanide to be able to 'see' the gold in the leaching process.
