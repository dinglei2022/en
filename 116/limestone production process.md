11.17 Lime Manufacturing 11.17.1 Process Description 1 5 Lime is the high temperature product of the calcination of limestone.Although limestone deposits are found in every state,only a small portion is pure enough for industrial lime manufacturing.To be classified as limestone,the rock must contain at least 50 percent calcium carbonate.How Cement Is Made Portland Cement AssociationThe heated air from the coolers is returned to the kilns,a process that saves fuel and increases burning efficiency.After the clinker is cooled,cement plants grind it and mix it with small amounts of gypsum and limestone.Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains.The cement is now ready for transport to ready mix.
