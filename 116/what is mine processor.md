Look into Ebay "Lots" of cromebooks Specifically one with intel Celeron N3040 or 3050s Those CPUs are weak AF but,they draw only 6W of power,and hash W is on par with ryzen 3000,and the laptops are selling for $20 $30 eachWhat is RandomX? List of RandomX Coins & Miners CPU,30 06 2021&#0183;&#32;If CPU mining becomes dominant then everyone in the world will have the capability to mine the coin and the token distribution will be fair This is not the case if GPUs or ASICs dominate the mining scene This is why Random X Proof of Work algorithm favors CPU mining
