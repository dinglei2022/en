## A short proof of the NPcompleteness of minimum sum
NPhard when restricted to bipartite graphs [2],planar graphs [4,7] and interval graphs [9].The proof in [9] for the NPhardness of minimum sum coloring on interval graphs is quite involved,the aim of this note is to give a simpler proof of this result.2 The reduction A graph G is a circular arc graph if it is the intersection graph ofDense subgraph WikipediaThe problem remains NPhard in bipartite graphs and chordal graphs but is polynomial for trees and split graphs.It is open whether the problem is NPhard or polynomial in (proper) interval graphs and planar graphs however,a variation of the problem in which the subgraph is required to be connected is NPhard in planar graphs.

## 1 Subgraph Isomorphism Stanford CS Theory
The (Induced) Subgraph Isomorphism computational problem is,given H and G,determine whether there is a (induced) subgraph isomorphism from H to G.If such an f exists,then we call f(H) a copy of H in G.If H is part of the input,Subgraph Isomorphism is an NPcomplete problem.It generalizes problemsnpchart WikipediaThe npchart differs from the pchart in only the three following aspects: The control limits are &#175 &#177 &#175 (− &#175),where n is the sample size and &#175 is the estimate of the longterm process mean established during controlchart setup.

## np complete PolynomialTime Reduction,&quotat least as hard
The problem cannot be done chaper than NP (i.e.is NPhard).This requires reduction of a known NPcomplete problem to your problem (see part 1).(3) The proof you showed establishes that if I can do 4color quickly,then I can do 3color quickly as well,in other words,4color is at least as hard as 3color,and so 4color is NPhard.The Graph Genus Problem Is NPCompleteThe Graph Genus Problem Is NPComplete CARSTEN THOMASSEN Mathematical Institute,The Technical University of Denmark,Building 303,DK2800 Lyngby,Denmark Received April 2,1988 revised June 17,1988 It is NPcompete to tell,given a graph G and a natural number k,whether G has genus k or less.

Here is my code,and it graphsSmall Sample Case for p and np Control Charts BPI ConsultingThe p and np chart are used to monitor variation in yes no type data.The control limit equations are valid as long as n*pbar &gt 5 or n*(1pbar) &gt 5.If this is not true,the binomial distribution which governs the p and np control charts is not symmetrical.This is called the small sample case for the p and np control charts.
