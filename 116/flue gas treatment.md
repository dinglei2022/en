## Flue Gas Treatment Hitachi Zosen Inova AG
Flue gas produced by energyfromwaste contains pollutants and must be cleaned before being discharged into the environment.These pollutants introduced into the process by the waste include oxidized combustion products such as SOx and NOx products,as well as substances such as chlorine,fluorine,heavy metals,dioxins and furans.Flue Gas Treatment Cabot CorporationWe are the first manufacturer to introduce activated carbon products for flue gas treatment.The unique mesopore structure of our powdered activated carbon (PAC) provides superior adsorption properties.This means the highest removal efficiencies with the lowest dosing rates,reducing handling time and transportation costs.
