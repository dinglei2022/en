## Mining Methods: Block Caving Geology for Investors
Block (gravity) caving is a bulk underground mining method,which allows large lowgrade deposits to be mined underground.This method involves undermining the orebody to make it collapse under its own weight into a series of chambers from which the ore extracted.It is a useful technique to extendHow Are Diamonds Mined And Extracted From the Beyond 4CsThere's another form of alluvial mining called artisanal mining.In essence,it is basically the same method employed by gold diggers which involves the screening and straining of mud.In the case of artisanal mining,the extraction process usually takes a longer time as it involves low tech equipment and manual labor.
