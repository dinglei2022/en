Screen mesh size and aperture micron conversion i.e.particle size is larger than the mesh size.For example,particles are 100 50 head means per squareStandard sieves and Mesh sizes 50megs2019101&ensp&#0183&enspLarger sieve openings (1 in.to 1 4 in.) have been designated by a sieve &quotmesh&quot size that corresponds to the size of the opening in inches.Smaller sieve &quotmesh&quot sizes of 3 1 2 to 400 are designated by the number of openings per linear inch in the sieve.The following convention is used to characterize particle size by mesh designation:
