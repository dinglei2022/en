## Cone Crushers McLanahan
Cone Crushers.A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel.Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two crushing members at the lowest point.Uncontrollable High speed of Cone crusher&quot;Uncontrollable High speed&quot; is the fault phenomenon of cone crusher,refers to that in the production process,the rotating speed of cone crusher's moving cone suddenly increases,the body suddenly generates violent vibration,the safety spring or the safety cylinder is in abnormal working state,the working current increases instantly,and the oil return temperature rises sharply.
