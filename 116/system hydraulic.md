A hydraulic system is a drive technology where a fluid is used to move the energy from e.g.an electric motor to an actuator,such as a hydraulic cylinder.The fluid is theoretically uncompressible and the fluid path can be flexible in the same way as an electric cable.Hydraulics Wikipedia20191013&ensp&#0183&enspHero describes a number of working machines using hydraulic power,such as the force pump,which is known from many Roman sites as having been used for raising water and in fire engines.Ancient Persia.The Persians constructed an intrie system of water mills,canals and dams known as the Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System.
