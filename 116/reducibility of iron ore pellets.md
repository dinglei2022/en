## Effect of Blaine Fineness on the Quality of Hematite Iron
2014128&ensp&#0183&enspIron ore pellets are largely characterized by inherent physical and chemical properties of ore as well as pelletizing conditions including induration time,induration temperature,etc.These parameters essentially vary with types of ores.The production of highquality pellets from hematite ore is challenging because of high level of fineness (Blaine number) and induration temperatureEFFECT OF SIZE OF IRON ORE PELLETS ON ITS2012625&ensp&#0183&ensproot of directly or indirectly.India is now not on ly producing iron ore pellets but also exporting it to other countries.Use of iron ore pe llets not only increase the productivity of the plant but also produce good quality iron.So it is essential to know about the various factors which affect the reducibility of th e iron ore pellet.

The effect of lime and silica addition on the reducibility,of sintered iron ore and synthetic hematite pellets was investigated The addition of lime and or silica (up to about 10% total) to sintered synthetic hematite pellets has little effect on the reducibility at 900&#176;CPorosity Characterization of Iron Ore Pellets by X,Iron ore pellets (Figure 1) are one of the main raw materials for steelmaking They are produced from ore fines in a process called pelletizing,which consists of two basic,As reducibility and physical resistance of a material are related to its porosity 2.
