## An Introduction to the Chemistry of Metal Extraction
The more reactive the metal is,the more difficult and expensive the extraction becomes.That means that you are having to use a very expensive reducing agent to extract the titanium.As you will see if you read the page about titanium extraction,there are other problems in its extraction which also add to the cost.What Is Metal Corrosion and Why Does It Occur?Corrosion is the deterioration of a metal as a result of chemical reactions between it and the surrounding environment.Both the type of metal and the environmental conditions,particularly gasses that are in contact with the metal,determine the form and rate of deterioration.
