## UtilityScale Solar Power SEIA
A utilityscale solar power plant can utilize several solar technologies primary photovoltaics (PV) or concentrating solar power (CSP).What distinguishes utilityscale solar from distributed generation is both project size and the fact that the electricity is sold to wholesale utility buyers,not enduse consumers.Utilityscale solarPowering A Generation: Generating ElectricityNuclear Plants.Although there are some important technical (and social) differences,nuclear power stations are thermal plants that make electricity in much the same way as fossilfuel plants.The difference is that they generate steam by using the heat of atomic fission rather than by burning coal,oil,or

## Fossil fuel power station Wikipedia
A fossil fuel power station is a thermal power station which burns a fossil fuel,such as coal or natural gas,to produce electricity.Fossil fuel power stations have machinery to convert the heat energy of combustion into mechanical energy,which then operates an electrical generator.Solar Power Plant Design and InterconnectionUtilityScale CSP Plant • Utilityscale CSP power plants have been predominantly solar thermal plants using parabolic trough technology • Since these plants use conventional synchronous generators with or without thermal energy storage electrical characteristics of the plant does not differ appreciable from that of a conventional power
