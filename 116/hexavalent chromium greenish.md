## Chromate conversion coating Wikipedia
20191122&ensp&#0183&enspChromate conversion coating is a type of conversion coating used to passivate steel,aluminium,zinc,cadmium,copper,silver,magnesium,and tin alloys.It is primarily used as a corrosion inhibitor,primer,decorative finish,or to retain electrical conductivity.The process is named after the chromate found in chromic acid,also known as hexavalent chromium,the chemical most widely usedChromate Conversion Franke Plating WorksThe RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) Directive is commonly referred to regarding elimination of hexavalent chromium.Chromate conversion coatings are commonly applied to everyday items such as hardware and tools,and can usually be recognized by their distinctively iridescent,greenishyellow color.
