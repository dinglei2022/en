## Size Reduction
Size Reduction Raw materials undergo size reduction through different mechanisms: impact,compression,and attrition.One way to classify size reduction equipment is into crushers and grinders,where grinders produce finer particles than crushers.What's the Types of Crushers?What are the different types of crushers? The crusher can be divided into three types according to the particle size of the feed and the final product.Primary crusher( from 1500 500mm to 350 100mm); secondary crusher( from 350 100mm to 100 40mm); tertiary crusher( from 100 40mm to 30 10mm).
