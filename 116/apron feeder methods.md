## How to Design Efficient and Reliable Feeders for Bulk Solids
How to Design Efficient and Reliable Feeders for Bulk Solids by John W.Carson,Ph.D.and Greg Petro,P.E.A feeder is an extremely important element in a bulk material handling system,since it is the means by which the rate of solids flow from a bin or hopper is controlled.When a feederOxide Lead Treatment &amp Extraction by Flotation &amp GravityThe ore is removed from the primary bin by means of an oversize apron feeder of the heavy duty type.Louvers should be available on the front or sides of the ore bin to enable the operator to poke the ore down into the apron feeder and thus prevent bridging.
