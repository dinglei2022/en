## DC motor Wikipedia
A compound DC motor connects the armature and fields windings in a shunt and a series combination to give it characteristics of both a shunt and a series DC motor.This motor is used when both a high starting torque and good speed regulation is needed.Universal motorThe universal motor is modified in several ways to allow for proper AC supply operation.There is a compensating winding typically added,along with laminated pole pieces,as opposed to the solid pole pieces found in DC motors.A universal motor's armature typically has far more coils and plates than a DC motor,and hence fewer windings per coil.

## fuzzy tension control scheme for roughing and intermediate rolling.
looperless interstand tension control of roughing and intermediate rolling mills remains a hard to solve problem.ω Roll speed of stand N q.T Electrical torque referred to the work roll of stand N.Equation (1) reveals that the speed dynamics of Stand N is dependant on the rolling force as well as both backward and&nbsp;.torque caracteristic of ball mill desertsafaridubai.co.inApplications: The processing of crushed material,collected gravel,and refined sand,etc.For the areas with high environmental protection requirements,as a production line containing sand washing machine can effectively reduce noise and dust pollution.
