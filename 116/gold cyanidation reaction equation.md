## Recovery of Gold and Silver and Removal of Copper,Zinc.
In cyanidation,metallic gold is oxidized and dissolved in an alkaline cyanide solution m [6].The oxidant e ployed is atmospheric oxygen,which,in the presence of an aqueous solution of sodium cyanide,causes the dis solution of gold and the formation of gold cyanide and sodium hydroxide,according to the so called Elsner reaction (Equations.simple reaction equation of separating gold in sodiumThe chemical reaction for the dissolution of gold,the "Elsner Equation",follows:.The basic ore slurry can be combined with a solution of sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide,however many operations utilize calcium cyanide.
