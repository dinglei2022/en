Magnetic separation can be another possible tertiary treatment.Drinking water treatment plants treat water (groundwater,surface water) for human use and combine the processes of coagulation,flocculation,sedimentation,filtration and disinfection.Coagulation is defined as the destabilization of charge on colloids and.selective flocculation behavior of chromite and serpentine5 May 2004.Several researchers,employing gravity separation,flotation and magnetic separation have attempted to recover the chromite values from these sites with limited success (Doğan et al.1996; Çiçek et al.1998; Güney and Önal,2000).The mineral chromite is the main valuable mineral in chromite ores.

## Maximizing the recovery of fine iron ore using magnetic separation
A mineralogical evaluation of all the test work products was undertaken to facilitate the interpretation of the test work results.These results were then used to propose an economically viable flowsheet for maximizing fine magnetite recovery using magnetic separation.Keywords: magnetite,magnetic flocculation,magnetic&nbsp;.Mineral processing ii SlideShare17 Apr 2014.Before 1939,only few ferromagnetic materials were available for industrial application.With the advancement of technology and design of machines,this method is adopted now for the separation of ores which are feebly magnetic.For Example: Hematite,limonite,siderite,etc,can now be separated from&nbsp;.

## Magnetic Flocculation Technology for Copper and Zinc Ions
Magnetic flocculation technology was investigated for the removal of copper and zinc ions from simulated tin smelting wastewater,and the effects of magnetic powder dosage,flocculant dosage,and pH on the removal of copper and zinc ions were estimated.The results show that the effluent quality is poor with magnetic powder,PAC and PAM separately dosed,but when magnetic powder is combinedMaximizing the recovery of fine iron ore using magneticThe recovery of fine iron ore by magnetic separation will decrease with decreasing particle size because the magnetic susceptibility of magnetic particles decreases with a decrease in particle mass.There is an example of an Australian ironore operation that introduced beneficiation of fine haematite,100 &#181m,by using
