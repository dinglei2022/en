## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted.The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey,bright yellow,deep purple,to rusty red.The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4),hematite (Fe 2 O 3),goethite,limonite or siderite.Hematite is also known as &quot;natural ore&quot;.Iron Ore benefiion Plants Belt ConveyorsManufacturer of Iron Ore benefiion Plants Belt Conveyors,Hydrocyclone,Slurry Pumps and Magnetite Beneficiation Plant offered by Star Trace Private Limited

## What Is Iron Ore Beneficiation? (with pictures)
31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Iron ore mining often focuses on looking for hematite deposits known as red iron ore,and magnetite,as they have naturally weak magnetic fields that aid in their purification.Hematite,however,responds better to the flotation process in iron ore beneficiation than magnetite,so it is the preferred type of ore.1000 gauss to 4500 gauss magnetic separator for iron20171012&ensp&#0183&ensp1000 gauss to 4500 gauss magnetic separator for iron beneficiation.Iron beneficiation magnetic separator includes sorting magnetite,maghemite and other strong magnetic iron ore stone,hematite,limonite,siderite ilmenite,chromite and weak magnetic iron ore strong magnetic separation equipment,equipment selection should be determined according to the properties of minerals.
