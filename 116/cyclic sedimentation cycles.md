## Cyclic Sedimentation of the Barren Measures Formation
The cyclic sedimentation of the Barren Measures Formation was controlled by autocyclic process which occurred due to the lateral migration of streams triggered by intrabasinal differential subsidence.Cyclic sediments Wikipedia2019930&ensp&#0183&enspCyclic sediments (also called rhythmic sediments) are sequences of sedimentary rocks that are characterised by repetitive patterns of different rock types or facies within the sequence.Processes that generate sedimentary cyclicity can be either autocyclic or allocyclic,and can result in piles of sedimentary cycles hundreds or even thousands of metres thick.
