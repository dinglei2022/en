PDF This paper is the first part of a research project which was supported by T&#252BITAK titled &quotDetermination of Optimum Limestone Content in Portland Limestone Cement Production from the ViewRetention of Silica Nanoparticles in Limestone Porous MediaDeposition and transport of nanoparticles were measured via nanoparticle concentration of effluent fluid,and energy distractive spectroscopy (EDS) measurement on the limestone core.It was found that silica nanoparticles dispersed in brine (NaCl) solutions are increasingly retained in limestone core as the solution ionic strength increases.
