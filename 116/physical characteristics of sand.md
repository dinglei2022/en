## Sand Wikipedia
20191013&ensp&#0183&enspSand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles.It is defined by size,being finer than gravel and coarser than silt.Sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type i.e.a soil containing more than 85 percent sandsized particles by mass.What is Silica? Universiti Sains Malaysia20181026&ensp&#0183&enspSilica sand is also normally required to be wellsorted,i.e.to have grains of an approximately uniform size.Most sources of sand used by the construction industry do not satisfy these requirements and are not,therefore,suitable for glassmaking.Industrial uses of silica sand depend on its purity and physical characteristics.Some of the
