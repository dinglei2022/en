## STRAITS HARVEST INTERNATIONAL Cement Products
The rising costs of raw materials like gypsum has played a heavy strain on the cement and construction industry.As result,many asian cement and plaster board companies have to explore alternate sources for gypsum.Cement producers in Asia are dependent on the import of high quality natural gypsum,mainly from Thailand.Carbon footprint analysis of calcined gypsum production inThe highest environmental influence could be assigned to the calcination of gypsum in the kiln (more than 50%),for both natural gypsum and FGD gypsum as raw materials.Burning of a substantial amount of natural gas during this process can be perceived as a significant factor generating greenhouse gas emissions and damaging the ozone layer.

FGD gypsum production and sales encourages power producers to capture "waste" for reuse,rather than merely storing it.The impurities are generally inert and harmless and typically consist of clay,anhydrite,or limestone in natural gypsum and fly ash in synthetic gypsum.Each individual source must be analyzed separately to assess itsC E M E N T CEMENT MILL TEST REPORTS: WhatWhat producers should know Proper analysis of a mill test report will help producers control quality before adding cement to the mix Some of the most important chemical changes occur in the kiln,where the kiln feed,the combined raw materials that eventually become portland cement,is burned at temperatures approaching 3,000&#176 F.
