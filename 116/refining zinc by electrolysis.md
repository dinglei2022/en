## The Extraction of Copper
When copper is made from sulfide ores by the first method above,it is impure.The blister copper is first treated to remove any remaining sulfur (trapped as bubbles of sulfur dioxide in the copper hence &quot;blister copper&quot;) and then cast into anodes for refining using electrolysis.What is the process of electrolytic refining of zinc? · Zinc processing Zinc (Zn) is the fourth most widely used metal,following iron,aluminum,and copper.It is mined mostly in Canada,the former USSR,Australia,Peru,Mexico and the US.The US is the world’s largest consumer of zinc.Zinc is a metal.

## Electrolysis
 · Russ i like many other members of the forum have tried variations of the electrolysis method and the truth is it only works on high grade material whether its high % Cu with trace elements of precious metals or 95% + Au with traces of PGMS,as soon as you drop below a certain % of the metal to be refined by electrolysis you get problems that.Zinc refiningZinc refining is the process of purifying zinc to special high grade (SHG) zinc,which is at least 99.995% pure.This process is not usually required when smelting of zinc is done through electrolysis processes,but is needed when zinc is produced by pyrometallurgical processes,because it is only 98.5% pure.
