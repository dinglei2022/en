Ellingham diagram is a plot between Δ f G o and T for the formation of oxides of metals A general reaction expressing oxidation is given by: 2xM(s) + O 2 (g) → 2M x O(s) As is evident from the reaction,the gaseous amount of reactant is decreasing from left to right as the product formed is solid metal oxide on the right sideCupola Furnace: Structure,Operation and Zones FoundryThe cupola is a most widely used foundry furnace for melting ferrous metals and alloys Sometimes,it is also used for melting non ferrous metals and alloys Cupola furnace is the cheapest means for converting pig iron or scrap metal into gray cast iron The fuel used is a good quality low sulphur coke Anthracite coal or carbon briquettes may.

## Steps in the Modern Steelmaking Process
Methods for manufacturing steel have evolved significantly since industrial production began in the late 19th century.Modern methods,however,are still based on the same premise as the original Bessemer Process,which uses oxygen to lower the carbon content in iron.Steps in the Modern Steelmaking ProcessAccording to the World Steel Association,some of the largest steel producing countries are China,India,Japan,and the U.S.China accounts for roughly 50% of this production.The world's largest steel producers include ArcelorMittal,China Baowu Group,Nippon Steel Corporation,and HBIS Group.
