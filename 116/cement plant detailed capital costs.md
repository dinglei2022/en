## Energy Efficiency and Saving in the Cement Industry
Cement accounts for 83% of total energy use in the production of nonmetallic minerals and 94% of CO 2 emissions.Energy represents 20% to 40% of the total cost of cement production.The production of cement clinker from limestone and chalk by heating limestone to temperatures above 950&#176C is the main energy consuming process.Cement WikipediaA cement is a binder,a substance used for construction that sets,hardens,and adheres to other materials to bind them together.There are two main forms of cement: Geopolymer cement and Portland Cement.Cement is seldom used on its own,but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry,or with sand and gravel,produces concrete.
