## Is flotation the unavoidable way for beneficiating metal
Synopsis.Although it is clear that flotation has become the conventional way for beneficiating metal sulphide ores and will remain so as long as grade is sufficient to bear the cost,other methods have to be taken into consideration.Column Flotation Packing and Role Analysis onThe Packing in column flotation is an effactive way of increasing separation efficiency and falling down column flotation height.By the contrast of flow pattern before and after the sieve packing,the change of flotation environment and the effect on flotation results were
