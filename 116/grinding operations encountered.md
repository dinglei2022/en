## US5251405A Method for circumferential grinding of
A method serves for circumferential grinding of radially noncircular workpieces,in particular for grinding cams (15) or polygons.The workpiece is rotated about a first second axis (13) extending at an angle,preferably of 90&#176,relative to the first axis (18).Starting out from a raw contour,the material at the surface of the workpiece (15) is removed along spiralshaped paths of a point
