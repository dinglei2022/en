## What is the meaning of M in M15,M20 etc,grade of concrete?
M stands for mix and 20 stands for the crushing strength of the concrete(in N mm2) at 28 days after casting,M20 is a grade of concrete which represents the compressive strength of concrete after 28 daysthe ratio of cement:sand:coarse aggregate in M20 concrete mix design is 1:15:3 18k ViewsConcrete Mix Design Absolute Volume Method,SI Units,Enter (from Table above) volume of coarse aggregate per unit volume of concrete = Enter specific gravity (Saturated Surface Dry,SSD) of coarse aggregate (if unknown,use 255 to 275 for normal weight aggregate) = Weight of coarse aggregate = kg m 3 Solid volume of coarse aggregate = m 3
