Drawing the thread without base edge fillets and draw a helix then sweeping the thread along the helix and filleting the model after thread is swept.Cheers Steve Griffiths If you want to make apple pie from scratch,first you must create the universe! RE: A constant radius forCHAPTER 82014813&ensp&#0183&enspThe helix line is a straight line on the development.The angle the helix line makes with the baseline is called the helix angle (true angle).To construct a conical helix,you must know its taper angle (angle between the cone's axis and an element on the cone surface) and lead.
