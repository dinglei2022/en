## Major quantitative techniques for risk analysis in the
Construction projects,because of their large and complex nature,are plagued by a variety of risks which must be considered and responded to in order to ensure project success.This study conducts an extensive comparative analysis of major quantitative risk analysis techniques in the construction industry.A review of quantitative analysis techniques forA construction project manager may not be able to plan the response effectively without an exhaustive knowledge of the volume of risk.This paper presents a review of various quantitative risk analysis techniques.It tries to build an overall understanding of various existing quantitative techniques for construction project risk analysis.
