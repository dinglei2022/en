## Grinding and polishing High Power Media
Grinding and polishing are the processes by which all these bearing surface specifiions are achieved.The grinding process needs to be carefully undertaken and has to be considered when machining the crankshaft prior to grinding.Where crankshafts are surface hardened,the depth of the hard 'case' on the component is relatively shallow.Analysis and Detection of Elastic Deformation of the LargeDue to the discontinuous axis and the big ratio of length to diameter,the largescale crankshaft is easy to generate the complex elastic deformation under the effect of the huge gravity and the clamping force on noncircular grinding machine.The distinctive deformation deteriorates the coaxiality of all the main journals and thus the grinding precision of crankpins in noncircular grinding.
