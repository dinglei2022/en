## Coal to liquids: Can fuel made from coal replace gasoline,
Coal based fuels are formed from coal gasification (creating synthetic gas from coal) followed by a series of steps to remove pollutants,synthesize the fuels and then separate out the liquids in a process known as Fischer Tropsch CTL fuels have several advantages over other alternative fuelsHow Does Coal Become a Diamond? Excavating the TruthConversion of coal to diamonds is a natural process that takes millions of years Even though there are carbon atoms in coal,the amount of impurities are so high,that it takes millions and millions of years for the coal to transform to its nearly purest form graphite The conversion of graphite to diamonds takes some more millions of years
