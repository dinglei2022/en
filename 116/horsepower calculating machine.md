## What is horsepower (hp)? How to Calculate Horsepower
Though horsepower units are a derivative of the 33,000 ftlbf min,it is not critical to understanding how to calculate motor horsepower for speed and torque.Another common unit of power that motors are rated in is watts.The conversion from watts to horsepower is 745.7 watts = 1 hp.How to Calculate Horsepower Required SciencingMost engines use horsepower to describe how much work they can do in a given amount of time.The constant 1 horsepower equals 550 foot pounds per second.In other words,1 horsepower is the amount of work required to move a load of 550 pounds over 1 foot
