2015312&ensp&#0183&enspCommon coagulants used for arsenic are iron salts and aluminum sulfate (alum).Alum coagulation is generally less efficient than iron coagulation,so alum should only be used in systems with low arsenic concentrations.Typical iron salts used are ferric chloride and ferric sulfate.Arsenic Removal with Iron(II) and Iron(III) in Waters with200411&ensp&#0183&enspArsenic removal by passive treatment,in which naturally present Fe(II) is oxidized by aeration and the forming iron(III) (hydr)oxides precipitate with adsorbed arsenic,is the simplest conceivable water treatment option.However,competing anions and low iron concentrations often require additional iron.Appliion of Fe(II) instead of the usually applied Fe(III) is shown to be advantageous
