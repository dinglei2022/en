## Gold ElectrorefiningPrecious Metal
Gold material are melt and cast into gold anode for electrorefining to obtain high purity gold (Au≥99.99%).Gold electrorefining is taken place in FRPP electrolysis cell.Crude gold casting plate is used as anode while high purity gold plate is used as hode.Gold ERElectrolytic refining of copper GoldRefiningWiki2018121&ensp&#0183&enspCopper is refined via electrolysis where an impure copper anode is slowly dissolved while on the hode very pure copper is deposited.Impurities in the copper that is more reactive than copper like zinc or nickel is dissolved while precious metals like gold,silver and PGM:s falls of and creates an anode slime.Some other metals will also end up in the slime,as tin,selenium and tellurium
