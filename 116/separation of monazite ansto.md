## Xenotime an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The main rare earth ores are monazite,bastnaesite and xenotime.Monazite is largely a light rare earth (La,Ce,Pr,Nd) phosphate (93 94%) and is often found as a component of mineral sands,which are usually mined primarily for ilmenite,rutile and zircon.ALKANE RESOURCES LTD AUSTRALIAN ZIRCONIA2 Corporate Profile • Listed on ASX since 1969,also listed on OTCQX (US) • Market cap ~$120M • ~6,300 shareholders • Multi commodity explorer,miner and developer focused on Central West of NSW,Australia • Active in region for more than 20 years • Developed Peak Hill Gold Mine in 1996,operated to 2005 being the end of mine life • TomingleyGold Project (TGP) a new gold mine

## The sulfuric acid bake and leach route for processing …
A patent by Li et al.(2010) also describes a high temperature sulfuric acid bake process,in this case for decomposing an iron rich monazite ore where iron is finely intergrown with monazite making separation by beneficiation difficult.The patented process involves baking with sulfuric acid in …Sulfuric acid baking and leaching of rare earth …Monazite,a rare earth and thorium bearing phosphate mineral,is one of the major minerals used for the production of rare earth elements.Although sulfuric acid baking is one of the main processing routes for extraction of rare earth elements from monazite,the chemistry involved is not well understood.
