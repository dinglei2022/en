## Mill liners Metso
In a stirred media mill,the mill body is static and the charge motion is created by an agitator such as a rotating spiral or impeller.We provide both original body liners and spiral impeller liners designed as a system for each of the mill sizes of Metso's extensive range of stirred media mills.Simulation and Characterization of Particle Damping …In this paper,we utilize the 3D discrete element method (DEM) for computer simulation and characterization of particle damping.With the DEM modeling tool validated with experimental results,it is shown that the particle damping can achieve a very high value of specific damping capacity.
