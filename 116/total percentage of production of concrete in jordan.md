The end result was a comprehensive reporting dashboard with one macro result of the total productivity factor,scored as a percentage where 100% is daily goal,then each above sub factor broken down so they could identify deficienci Each sub factor is weighted in proportion to its importanceHow Concrete is MadeA properly designed mixture possesses the desired workability for the fresh concrete and the required durability and strength for the hardened concrete Typically,a mix is about 10 to 15 percent cement,60 to 75 percent aggregate and 15 to 20 percent water Entrained air in many concrete mixes may also take up another 5 to 8 percent
