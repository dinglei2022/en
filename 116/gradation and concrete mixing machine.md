## Gradation Test Pavement Interactive
The standard gradation and sieve analysis test is: AASHTO T 27 and ASTM C 136: Sieve Analysis of Fine and Coarse Aggregates; Background The particle size distribution,or gradation,of the constituent aggregate (Figure 3) is one of the most influential characteristics in determining how an HMA mixture will perform as a pavement materialAggregate Gradation Matters Concrete Construction MagazineOf course,the cost will increase,and the shrinkage and temperature of the concrete will increase Ideal gradation The pressure to use more pozzolans and lower total cementitious contents is leading the industry to use more sophisticated mix designs Most ready mix concrete producers use their own methods,hire a testing lab,or rely on a vendor
