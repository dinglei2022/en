## Treatment of copperrich gold ore by cyanide leaching
201532&ensp&#0183&enspAbstract: The treatment of a copper sulphidebearing gold ore by direct cyanide leaching,ammonia pretreatment and ammoniacal cyanide leaching was investigated.Dissolution behaviour of gold and copper in these leaching systems was demonstrated.Severe interference by the copper containing sulphides with cyanide leaching of gold is observed atHow copper is made material,used,processing,steps,product.The development of more efficient processing techniques in the late 1800s allowed the mining of lower grade copper ores from huge open pit mines in the.

## How copper is produced Mining For Zambia
Sulphide ore treatment process.The copper is liberated from the sulphide ore through a chemical processes called flotation.The resulting copper mixture is called concentrate,which is a greyblack powder that looks a bit like ash.It is roughly 30% copper,and may also contain traces of gold and silver.The copper concentrate then goes toThe treatment of copper gold ores by ammoniumCopper gold ores form a type of refractory gold ore.Large quantities of this ore type are available for processing.Cyanide treatment of ores with a high cyanide soluble copper to gold ratio is unfavourable due to high cyanide consumption resulting from the formation of copper cyanide complexes.
