## ION EXCHANGE TREATMENT AdEdge Water Technologies
Ion Exchange (IX) is a method of removing undesirable metallic salt ions from water by exchanging them with other ions attached to a media or resin.This chemical process occurs because ions have differing affinities for the resin and these ions will replace ions with less attraction as they flow over the media.GE Healthcare Fred Hutch20191210&ensp&#0183&enspdifferences in their speciﬁc properties,as shown in Figure I.1.Ion exchange chromatography (IEX) separates biomolecules according to differences in their net surface charge.Property Technique Charge Ion exchange chromatography (IEX) Size Size exclusion chromatography (SEC),also called gel ﬁltration (GF)
