## Understanding Sinter and Sinter Plant Operations …
Use of sized sinter is desirable for the improvement of production rates in the blast furnace.Further,crushing the sinter to 30 mm size at the sinter plant yields a more stable sinter because the smaller size fractions are more resistant to degradation.A supervisory …Development of Pellet Sinter Composite Agglomerate for Blast.However,this process is in operation with improved blast furnace productivity in Japan as shown by Niwa et al.The investigators have made the pellet with ultra fines iron oxide and subsequently used in sinter bed to get a composite mass of pellet and sinter mix where,acid pellets were embedded in to the sinter mass.

## Low basicity sintering experiment of Chengde vanadium.
The sintering process and sinter quality of vanadium titanium magnetite produced in Chengde District were studied by sintering pot experiment,and the feasibility of using low basicity sinter to substitute pellet was discussed.The results reveal that compared with the.EFFECT OF MAGNETITE,HEMATITE AND PELLET. LKABorder to maintain iron content and gangue levels of sinter feed,the sinter ores became finer due to an increased necessity of beneficiation at the mining site.One way to adjust for the decreased sinter quality has for some blast furnace operators been to increase in the usage of pellet in the blast furnace burden.Others have&nbsp;.
