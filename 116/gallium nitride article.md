## New appliions for gallium nitride — Korea University
title = &quotNew appliions for gallium nitride" abstract = &quotThe appliions and the advantages of GaNbased materials are discussed.The increase of interest in the AlGalnN family of materials is fueled by the appliion of blue green UV light emitting diodes.Graphene helps flatten gallium nitride Chemical.Materials researchers have laid down gallium nitride as a two dimensional material for the first time with some help from graphene sheets.Getting GaN to flatten out took some doing because the semiconductor’s 3 D crystals don’t exist naturally as stacks of atomic layers,as is the case with graphene,hexagonal boron nitride,and most other.
