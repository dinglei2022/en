## AP 42,CH 11.6: Portland Cement Manufacturing EPA
materials are produced in portland cement manufacturing plants.A diagram of the process,which encompasses production of both portland and masonry cement,is shown in Figure 11.6 1.As shown in the figure,the process can be divided into the following primary components: raw materials acquisition and handling,kiln&nbsp;.Application Description Portland Cement Concrete User.Basic components of PCC include coarse aggregate (crushed stone or gravel),fine aggregate (usually natural sand),Portland cement,and water.The aggregate functions as a filler material,which is bound together by hardened Portland cement paste formed by chemical reactions (hydration) between the Portland cement and water.
