## What is solidifiion of metals Answers
solidifiion is the process of transformation form a liquid phase to a solid phase.i requires heat removal from the system.metals have a melting point (well defined temperature) above whichInteractives.The Rock Cycle.How Rocks ChangeThe high temperatures required are generally found only deep within the earth.The rock is pulled down by movements in the earth's crust and gets hotter and hotter as it goes deeper.It takes temperatures between 600 and 1,300 degrees Celsius (1,100 and 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit) to melt a rock,turning it into a substance called magma (molten

## Magma Versus Lava: How It Melts,Rises,and Evolves
When magma invades a place in the solid crust,it influences the &quotcountry rock&quot existing there.Its hot temperature and its leaking volatiles can cause portions of the country rock usually the felsic part to melt and enter the magma.Xenoliths whole chunks of country rock can enter the magma this way too.This process is calledIgneous Rocks: Formation,Types and Examples Earth EclipseIgneous rocks form from the cooling of magma molten materials in the earth's crust.The terminology Igneous means fire or heat.In this sense,igneous rocks are formed when molten rock (magma) solidifies either underneath the earth crust to form plutonic (intrusive) igneous rocks or on the surface of the earth to form volcanic (extrusive) igneous rocks.
