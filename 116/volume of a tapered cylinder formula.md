## How to Calculate the Volume of a Cylinder in Gallons
The volume of a cylinder depends on two parameters: the radius of its circular crosssection and its length.Measure these in inches or feet,and you'll get the volume in cubic inches or cubic feet.Measure in metric units and you'll get the volume in cubic meters,liters or milliliters.Volume Formulas for Geometric Shapes.Volume formula of a Cube: V = a 3.where V a cube volume,a the length of an edge.See also online calculator for computing a cube volume.Volume of a right circular cylinder is equal to the product of the area of its base times the height.Volume formula of a right circular cylinder: V = π R 2 h.
