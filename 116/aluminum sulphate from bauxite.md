Alumina is the common name given to aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) Alumina is produced from bauxite,an ore that is mined from topsoil in various tropical and subtropical regions The Bayer process,discovered in 1887,is the primary process by which alumina is extracted from bauxite To produce pure aluminum,alumina is smelted using the Hall.What is aluminiumAnother rather common mineral,bauxite,is used today as the primary raw material in aluminium production.Bauxite is a clay mineral comprising various modifiions of aluminium hydroxide mixed with iron,silicon,titanium,sulphur,gallium,chromium,vanadium oxides,as well as sulphuric calcium,iron and magnesium carbonates.

## Aluminum sulfate poses hazards to human health,
The manufacture of aluminum sulfate begins with the extraction of bauxite ore,which has a deleterious impact on the environment through habitat degradation and fragmentation by roads,and through carbon emissions12 Aluminum sulfate is a dry acid,and can create zones of high acidity if accidentally spilledAluminium production & environmental impactBauxite mining Aluminium doesn’t occur as a isolated ore (it’s too reactive with other compounds) but as one combined with other minerals,chief of which is bauxite Bauxite is mined from open mines from locations mainly in a wide belt around the equator Bauxite is a mixture of aluminium hydroxide,iron oxide,titanium dioxide and kaolinite
