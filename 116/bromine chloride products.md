## Bromine Brom ICLIP
Bromine is highly reactive and is a powerful oxidizing agent in the presence of water.It reacts vigorously with Amines,Olefins and Phenols as well as Aliphatic and Aromatic Hydrocarbons,Ketones and Acids,Brominating them either by addition or substitution.With many of the metals and elements,anhydrous Bromine is less reactive than wet BromineThe Role and Nucleophilicity of Chloride and BromideFirst,it compares the nucleophilic nature of chloride and bromide,and second,it compares the effects caused by the structure of the substrate.By having the nucleophiles compete in the same reaction mixture,an NMR analysis will be able to reveal the proportion of nucleophilic attacks that occurred with bromine compared to chloride.
