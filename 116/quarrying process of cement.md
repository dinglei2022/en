## Quarry Process Stone (QP) Sparta Block
Quarry Process Stone is a mixture of crushed stone about 3 4â€³ in diameter that has been reduced in size and mixed with stone dust QP can be composited of different types of natural stone: granite,gneiss,trap rock and othersHow Portland Cement is Made? Manufacturing Process ofPortland cement can be made by following two different processes a dry one and a wet one.Joseph Aspdin first made portland cement in his kitchen stove in England in the 19th century.Lime and silica make up approximately 85% of portland cement.The materials that are commonly used are limestone,shells,chalk,shale,clay,slate,silica sand,and iron ore.
