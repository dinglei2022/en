## Modelling SAG milling power and specific energy.
Two new SAG milling models are developed in this work,able to predict power or specific energy consumption,including the usual design variables such as mill size; balls charge level,solids concentration in the SAG mill feed and % of critical speed,but adding a variable that represents the feed size …grate rod millThe peripheral discharge type of Ball Rod Mill is a modification of the grate type,and is recommended where a free gravity discharge is desired.It is particularly applicable when production of too many fine particles is detrimental and a quick pass through the mill is desired,and for dry grinding.MORE INFO
