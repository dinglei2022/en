## What is Compressive Strength of Concrete Cube Test and
Compressive strength is an important property of concrete.By conducting the cube test,we can get an idea about the concrete mix has done properly or not.We can check the strength of concrete at 7th,14th&amp 28th day,without damaging the structure.Compressive Strength of Concrete at 7 days,28 daysCompressive Strength of Concrete at 7 days,28 days Calculation &amp Formula is required to get the compressive strength of the related concrete structure.Here we described the procedure of compressive strength test of cubes at 7 days and 28 days with calculation and formula as per IS Code.

## What is Compressive Strength? Matmatch
The compressive strength of concrete is often tested to evaluate if the actual concrete mix meets the requirements of the design specifiion.The test is usually conducted in batching laboratories.In order to conduct the compressive strength test,a small sample of concrete mix is first cast in a cube or cylinder form and allowed to age for
