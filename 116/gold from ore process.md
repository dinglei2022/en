2019628&ensp&#0183&enspFigure 4 CIL CIP Process Flow Schematic.Both CIP and CIL are continuous processes,where activated carbon is added to the ore water pulp.The first step in gold extraction is leaching the gold which turns gold in solid form to liquid with cyanide in the presence of oxygen.How Is Gold Processed? ReferenceGold is processed by cyanide milling,a chemical procedure that separates 95 to 98 percent of the gold from raw mined ore.It is then refined to the gold standard purity,according to Mineweb.Heap leaching is a less expensive method of gold extraction,but it is a longer process and it recovers less gold than the cyanide milling process.
