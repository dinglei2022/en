## Gasket Temperature Range Flexible Material Temperature
The gasket material with the biggest temperature range is Thermiculite.Thermiculite has the biggest overall range of any slightly flexible gasket material from below 150⁰C to + 1000⁰C.It is available in sheet form,within a Kammprofile,as the filler in a spiral wound and within a ring type joint.Appliions for the highest temperatureGasket Wikipedia2019129&ensp&#0183&enspSpiral wound gaskets are also used in high pressure pipelines and are made with stainless steel outer and inner rings and a center filled with spirally wound stainless steel tape wound together with graphite and PTFE,formed in V shape.Internal pressure acts upon the faces of the V,forcing the gasket to seal against the flange faces.
