## Rocks Article about Rocks by The Free Dictionary
Rocks natural aggregates of minerals of more or less constant composition which form the independent geological bodies that comprise the earth’s crust The Russian term for rocks in its modern sense was first used by the Russian mineralogist and chemist V M Severgin (1798) Rocks are mechanical combinations of minerals,including liquid minerals.Biomineralization WikipediaBiomineralization,or biomineralisation is the process by which living organisms produce minerals,often to harden or stiffen existing tissu Such tissues are called mineralized tissuIt is an extremely widespread phenomenon; all six taxonomic kingdoms contain members that are able to form minerals,and over 60 different minerals have been identified in organisms
