## Selection of Stainless Steel for Cathode Plate in
201715&ensp&#0183&enspRecently,the hydrometallurgy for metal refining is getting more and more popularin China.During a traditional hydrometallurgical process sulphuric acid is often used.In many cases,the working conditions in the solvent extraction and electro winning processes could be very tough for the commonly used material of different equipment and components,such as,austenitic stainless steels of 304Minerals Engineering International Online.Minerals Engineering International: Hydrometallurgy.The newly developed hydrometallurgical refining process is an integral part of that strategy.
