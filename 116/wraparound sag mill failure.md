## sag calculation in conveyors belt
Jan 07,2011 Belt sag produces a flexure of belt and material as the conveyor is deformed over every idler Larger sag means more flexure and greater energy loss with ieach flexing If you use the CEMA standard method of analysis for tension and power,you will note that 2% sag at the tail vs 1% sag tension will result in a larger tension.SAG Mill Liners BreakageIn any case,pebble crushing works,though metal in the SAG mill pebbles is a significant problem for crushing.Especially if your ore is also magnetic as ours is.In 1992 National Steel Pellet Company published a paper at SME that compared a normally fed SAG mill circuit with a fully autogenous circuit equipped with pebble crushing.

## INNOVATION NEWS Mills and GMDs
Early SAG mills had a diameter of about 32',later increasing to 34,36,38 and 40'.At the same time the mill volume also increased.Typically a SAG mill has a much larger diameter compared to its length.Yet the SAG mill of Newmont's Yanacocha mine in Peru is a single stage mill (no ball mill after the SAG millCMP Paper 16.10.09 FinalWhen mill diameter and mill power became again increased,only the Gearless Mill Drive (GMD) could be envisaged to cover this requirement above 10 MW.The GMD is by its nature a variable speed drive system.Process operators,once having the facility of adjustable speed,could n
