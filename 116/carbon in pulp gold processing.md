## Activated Carbon in Gold Cyanidation
Cyanidation,or the metallurgical process of extracting gold from ore with cyanide leaching agents,has long been a primary method of gold beneficiation.Widely used throughout the world,one incredible material helps to make gold recovery from a cyanide solution possible; with its ultra porous structure,activated carbon is a powerful adsorbent used throughout a number of industries to.Carbon Adsorption In Recovery Of Gold12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The carbon in pulp method is only used where tank leaching is utilized for the recovery of gold from the ores and this is not the case in most large gold mines today,since heap leaching is the lowest cost method for recovering gold from ores containing from a few grams to 5 or 6 grams per ton.
