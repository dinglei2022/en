## How Much Does a Cubic Foot of Sand Weigh? Reference
Depending on the type in question,a cubic foot of sand can weigh anything from 90 lb per cubic foot to 130 lb per cubic foot Assuming common dry sand,the weight would be around 100 lb per cubic foot There are different types of sand,and each type has its own specific gravityAggregates Portland Cement AssociationAggregates are inert granular materials such as sand,gravel,or crushed stone that,along with water and portland cement,are an essential ingredient in concrete.15 percent by weight of the total aggregate.Unit weight measures the volume that graded aggregate and the voids between them will occupy in concrete.
