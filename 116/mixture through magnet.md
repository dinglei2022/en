## Homogeneous Mixture ScienceStruck
Air is a mixture of various gases like oxygen,carbon dioxide,nitrogen,rare gases,etc.which are present in one phase alone.We should be grateful that air is a homogeneous mixture.If air wasn't one,and the components were not uniformly distributed,we would have had to go hunting for regions on the planet where oxygen was concentrated.Magnetic Separation Washington University in St.Louis2002213&ensp&#0183&enspMagnetic Separation.These minerals can be separated by wrapping the poles of a magnet in paper,passing the magnet over the mineral mixture.The ferromagnetic minerals will stick to the magnet and may be easily separated by removing the paper covering the magnet.The magnetic separator consists of a large electromagnet through which

What is a Mixture? A mixture is a substance in which two or more substances are mixed but not chemically joined together,meaning that a chemical reaction has not taken place.Mixtures can be easily separated and the substances in the mixture keep their original properties.Imagine mixing skittles and full size marshmallows,the individual components (skittles and marshmallows) could easilyHow to separate sand salt and iron filings QuoraLet's see here,firstly we have iron filings which happen to be magnetic,I'm sure you can see where this is going use the magnet to remove the iron filings (you probably want to cover the magnet with a plastic bag for easy iron filing removal)
