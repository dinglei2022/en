## What happens when acid reacts with limestone? Questions
Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3).This is not very soluble,so rocks don't dissolve very quickly.But if you add an acid,you add hydrogen ions (H+),which will react with the carbonate to form hydrogen carbonate HCO3 ions,which are very soluble in water,and the limestone will dissolve.Or,if there is more acid,two hydrogen ions willLimestone Quality CalculatorCoaxing the best produce from asparagus to zucchini.Small Fruits & Nuts.Enjoying the sweet fruits of your labor.Limestone Quality Calculator.

## What happens when acid reacts with limestone? Questions,
Jun 15,2008&#0183;&#32;Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3) This is not very soluble,so rocks don't dissolve very quickly But if you add an acid,you add hydrogen ions (H+),which will react with the carbonate to form hydrogen carbonate HCO3 ions,which are very soluble in water,and the limestone will dissolve Or,if there is more acid,two hydrogen ions willLIME: CALCIUM OXIDE Bassam ShakhashiriLIME: CALCIUM OXIDE.CaO.Calcium oxide is a white crystalline solid with a melting point of 2572̊C.namely lime.The abundance of limestone in the
