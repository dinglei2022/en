## Stone,Gravel,or Aggregate? Concrete Construction,
Question: I have a specification calling for #89 gravel in the concrete mix and #57 stone for the subbase What do these numbers mean? Answer: This all comes from ASTM C 33,“Standard Specification for Concrete Aggregat” First,there's really no difference in this context between stone and gravel and aggregate In C 33 there's a chart showing the grading requirements for different sizes.standard specification for crushed aggregate for,standard specification for crushed aggregate for macadam pavements download;,ASTM D693 Crushed Aggregate for Macadam Pavements Code pdf,NH Standard Data Book (Road & Bridge) 29 01 2013 MP PWD
