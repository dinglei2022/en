## Chinese bismuth producers could cut production on tight
Chinese bismuth supply has declined since the beginning of 2017 as a result of some producers reducing production during environmental inspections,according to market participants.If spot supply continues to shrink due to producers shutting down operations on limited profit margins in the near term,this could underpin spot prices.China creates world's biggest bismuth producer MetalThe new company,called Chenzhou Bismuth Group,has a capacity of 3,000 tpy and could give Chinese producers more bargaining clout with overseas customers and help support domestic prices.&quotIt is a price or industry alliance rather than a joint venture as far as I see.
