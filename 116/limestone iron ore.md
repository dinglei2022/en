 · I know that limestone is calcium oxide.It is combined with coke and iron ore in order to produce molten iron (alond with slag).I need to know and understand why calcium oxide is added to the furnace.Thank you.Why are carbon and limestone mixed with the iron ore before.Carbon reacts with the iron ore in stages of the Blast Furnace to produce pure Iron and Carbon dioxide.It also acts as a fuel for the blast furnace.Limestone is added as a flux in the process which combines with the impurities like sulphur in the ore and removes them as slag which floats above the molten pure iron.
