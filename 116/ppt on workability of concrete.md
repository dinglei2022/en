## What is Workability of Concrete? Gilson Co.
Workability of Concrete is a broad and subjective term describing how easily freshly mixed concrete can be mixed,placed,consolidated and finished with minimal loss of homogeneity.Workability is a property that directly impacts strength,quality,appearance,andstudy of workability and compressive strength2016421&ensp&#0183&enspstudy of workability and compressive strength characteristics of ash blended cement concrete Av VIP VIP 100w VIP

Different Test Methods for Workability Measurement Depending upon the water cement ratio in the concrete mix,the workability may be determined by the following three methods.Slump Test Compaction Factor Test Veebee Consistometer Test 1.Slump Test Suitability This method is suitable only for the concrete of high workability.This test is carried out with []Properties of Concrete Workability,Setting,BleedingFresh concrete is that stage of concrete in which concrete can be moulded and it is in plastic state.This is also called &quotGreen Concrete&quot.Another term used to describe the state of fresh concrete is consistence,which is the ease with which concrete will flow.The transition process of changing of concrete from plastic state to hardened state.
