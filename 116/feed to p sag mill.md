SAG Mill Feed Chute Design Long Life Wear Resistant This design of SAG mill feed chute lasted 9 months seeing 90,000 TPD.It is 600 brinell chrome steel.With the big liners on the bottom of the chute you need to get a Chevron cast into the top to push the feed.Mill (grinding)SAG is an acronym for semi autogenous grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor.
