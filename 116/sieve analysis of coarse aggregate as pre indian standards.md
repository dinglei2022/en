## What is the importance of sieve analysis of aggregates?
Sieve analysis test results in gradation of aggregates in coarse and fine on the basis of their particle sizes.Gradation is usually specified for each engineering appliion it is used for.Sieve Analysis of Soil Its Determination,Theory20191213&ensp&#0183&enspBased on the practical experience,the fineness modulus of fine aggregate should be between 2 to 3.5 and of coarse aggregate between 3.5 to 8.Usually,the Fineness modulus is calculated for fine aggregate rather than for coarse aggregate.Sieve Analysis of Soil Test.Designation: ASTM D421,D422.AASHTO T87,T88.Apparatus: 1.Set of sieves.2.
