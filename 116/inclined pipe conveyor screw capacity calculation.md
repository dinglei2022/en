## Screw Conveyors,Inclined Screw Conveyor,Screw Feeder,
The Screw Conveyor has a constant volumetric capacity according to speed It may be exposed to a head of material and by having a correctly designed flight and with variation in the speed can be used to control and feed equipment at a uniform metered rate down the process stream,eliminating surges in the processConveyor Belt Calculations Brighthub EngineeringThe conveyor belt calculations methodology discussed in the article is to be used only for the guidance on calculating the initial conveyor design parameters; the final design must be validated by using the FEA or other similar tools before building the prototype
