## Aggregate Crushing Value CivilArc
The aggregate crushing value provides a subjective measure of the resistance of the aggregate crushing in the pressure of the progressively smeared compressive load.When the aggregate crushing value is 30 or greater the outcome can be irregular and in those kind of circumstances the ten percent fines value has to be assessed in its place(PDF) AGGREGATE CRUSHING PLANT Birhanu Shiferaw95 to100 12.5mm &#189 in 80 to95 4.75mm No.4 50 to 85 2.36mm No.8 25 to28 From my visit to two quarry sites I can say,commonly the aggregate selection around Addis Ababa is based on three classes two groups of fine aggregates (called 00 and 01) and one coarse aggregate (called 02).

These aggregates,depending on their ultimate use,can be sized according to the required dimensions and tolerances.The advantage of using a hard rock crusher fine is that all of the material that makes up the mix is from rock,and because it's been crushed,the sides are all fractured (six sided fractured aggregate).Aggregates for Concrete GreenSpec• Aggregates in any particular mix of concrete are selected for their durability,strength,workability and ability to receive finishes.• For a good concrete mix,aggregates need to be clean,hard,strong particles free of absorbed chemicals or coatings of clay and other fine
