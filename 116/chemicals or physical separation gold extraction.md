## How gold is made history,used,parts,procedure
Gold,recognizable by its yellowish cast,is one of the oldest metals used by humans.As far back as the Neolithic period,humans have collected gold from stream beds,and the actual mining of gold can be traced as far back as 3500 B.C.when early Egyptians (the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia) used mined gold to craft elaborate jewelry,religious artifacts,and utensils such as goblets.Recovery of Gold,Silver,Palladium,and Copper from2015317&ensp&#0183&enspwt% copper,0.04 wt% gold,0.15 wt% silver,and 0.01 wt% palladium.The extraction of these metals from PCBs is both Physical separation,(2) metal recovery,and (3) waste treatment.Stage 1 involves size reduction to This paper discusses the recovery of gold,silver,palladium,and copper from endoflife printed circuit boards of
