## Compressive Strength of Concrete Cube Test,Procedure
Compressive strength of concrete cube test provides an idea about all the characteristics of concrete.By this single test one judge that whether Concreting has been done properly or not.Concrete compressive strength for general construction varies from 15 MPa (2200 psi) to 30 MPa (4400 psi) and higher in commercial and industrial structures.What is the relation between N mm2 and MPa of compressive1 N mm&#178 = 1 MPa Pascal (Pa) is defined as one newton per metre square.Pa = N m&#178 [In the SI system,Mega or M is a unit prefix of 10⁶] Pa * 10⁶ = (N m&#178)* 10⁶ MPa = N (m&#178*10⁻⁶) [In the SI system,Milli or m is a unit prefix of 10⁻&#179] MPa = N (m&#178*10⁻
