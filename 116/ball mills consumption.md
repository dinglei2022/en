## Charge behaviour and power consumption in ball mills.
This paper is the second installment of an ongoing numerical study of ball mills.The first installment (Cleary,1998a) described the basic modelling of a 5 m ball mill.Predictions of charge profile,charge segregation,power draw,torque,liner wearEmaxThe High Energy Ball Mill Emax combines high frequency impact,intensive friction,and controlled circular jar movements to a unique and highly effective size reduction mechanism.The grinding jars have an oval shape and are mounted on two discs respectively which move the jars on a circular course without changing their orientation.

## Best energy consumption
A typical comparison of three competing technologies is given in Table 1,demonstrating that an efficient ball mill third generation separator,CKP ball mill third generation separator and vertical mill on a typical 4000Blaine limestone cement show little overall difference in energy consumption.The hardness of grinding media ballWhen the feed rate of the ball mill is increased or the grinding rate is required to be too fine,the service efficiency of the ball mill wear resistant grinding media ball is in a lower range,thus increasing the power consumption of the ball mill and increasing the damage rate of the wear resistant grinding media Ball.
