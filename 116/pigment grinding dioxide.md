## Titanium Dioxide For Coatings The Chemours Company
Titanium Dioxide.Ti Pure™.I.TITANIUM DIOXIDE PIGMENTS.Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the most important white pigment used in the coatings industry.It is widely.the grinding process: 1.Wetting,where air and other substances are displaced from the pigment surface by solvent,dispersant surfactant and binder.2.Titanium dioxide pigment grinding process and equipment.Titanium dioxide pigment particle size and size distribution has very strict requirements.Industry method of grinding titanium can be divided into wet and dry grinding.
