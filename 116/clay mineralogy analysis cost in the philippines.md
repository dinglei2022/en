## Environmental Characteristics of Clays and Clay Mineral,
Clay minerals have a wide range of particle sizes from 10's of angstroms to millimeters (An angstrom is a unit of measure at the scale of atoms) Thus,clays may be composed of mixtures of finer grained clay minerals and clay sized crystals of other minerals such as quartz,carbonate,and metal oxid Clays and clay minerals are found mainly.A Study on Engineering Properties of Cement Stabilized2019121&ensp&#0183&enspThanjavur and Pudhukottai samples along the above road stretches are having silt and clay particles from 30 to 45%.Based on the soil properties,it was considered that the cement is a suitable stabilizer.Cement used as a soil stabilizer in different percentages (2%,
