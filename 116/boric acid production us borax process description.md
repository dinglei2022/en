## Boric Acid The Chemical Company
Description.Boric acid,also called hydrogen borate,boracic acid,orthoboric acid or acidum boricum is a weak acid of boron often used as an antiseptic,insecticide,flame retardant,or a neutron absorber,and a precursor of other chemical compounds.Desalination Posttreatment: Boron removal ProcessDesalination Posttreatment: Boron Removal Process.At a daily intake of over 5 g of boric acid the human body is clearly negatively influenced,causing nausea,vomiting,diarrhoea and blood clotting.Boron removal drops at about 78%,leaving 1.15 mg L in the Pass1 permeate stream.Therefore,a specific Boron Removal Process is
