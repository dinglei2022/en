## Boric Acid The Chemical Company
Description.Boric acid,also called hydrogen borate,boracic acid,orthoboric acid or acidum boricum is a weak acid of boron often used as an antiseptic,insecticide,flame retardant,or a neutron absorber,and a precursor of other chemical compounds.Desalination Posttreatment: Boron removal ProcessDesalination Posttreatment: Boron Removal Process.At a daily intake of over 5 g of boric acid the human body is clearly negatively influenced,causing nausea,vomiting,diarrhoea and blood clotting.Boron removal drops at about 78%,leaving 1.15 mg L in the Pass1 permeate stream.Therefore,a specific Boron Removal Process is

20141217&ensp&#0183&enspII.DESCRIPTION AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES Borax is a salt of the element boron.Chemically it is referred to as disodium tetraborate decahydrate (Na2B407 •10H2O,CAS# 1303964) (US Borax 2008).Borax contains 11.34% boron.Boron is always chemically bound to oxygen forming borates (e.g.borax or boric acid).Boric Oxide A pure form of B2O3 US BoraxUS Borax boric oxide is a pure anhydrous product It is ideal when boric acid is required without metals This hard,glassy,granular product is water soluble at a much slower rate than boric acid—and reacts exothermically when wetted When exposed to the atmosphere,it slowly absorbs water,reverting to boric ac Benefits & Applications
