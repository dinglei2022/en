Limestone Limestone is a very common sedimentary rock consisting of calcium carbonate (more than 50%) It is the most common non siliciclastic (sandstone and shale are common siliciclastic rocks) sedimentary rockLimestones are rocks that are composed of mostly calcium carbonate (minerals calcite or aragonite)Chapter 17 authorSTREAMPresentations (PPT,KEY,PDF) logging in or signing up Chapter 17,Caverns Large caves or chambers in caves Found anywhere there’s a massive limestone deposit at near the surface Usually larger horizontally than vertically Connection to surface may be small or hidden May be very extensive system of “rooms” Stream may flow along floor.
