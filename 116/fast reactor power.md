## Modeling and Analysis of Nuclear Reactor
The supercritical carbon dioxide(SCO2)is considered as a potential working medium for the commercial nuclear reactor system and three types of Gen IV fast reactors.Engineering equation solver(EES)was introduced to set up a model for SCO2 Brayton cycle,and aAbout UsNuclear power is identified as an essential element of energy infrastructure.Expand.2007.Work on Traveling Wave Reactor (TWR) physics and engineering concepts begins.The reactor will be used to research and test key materials for sodium fast reactor technologies.
