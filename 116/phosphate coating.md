## Phosphate coatings for corrosion resistance Zinc
Phosphate coatings: are used on steel parts for corrosion resistance,lubricity,or as a foundation for subsequent coatings or painting.It serves as a conversion coating in which a dilute solution of phosphoric acid and phosphate salts is applied via spraying or immersion,chemically reacts with the surface of the part being coated to form a layer of insoluble,crystalline phosphates.【phosphate coating】：32 Influence of different kinds of surfactants on zinc phosphate coating was investigated by means of coating weight tests,adhesion and alkali resistance.、,。

## Phosphate coating [SubsTech]
Dr.Dmitri Kopeliovich Phosphate coating (phosphating) is a conversion coating consisting of an insoluble crystalline metalphosphate salt formed in a chemical reaction between the substrate metal and a phosphoric acid solution containing ions of metals (zinc,iron or magnesium).Conversion coating is a film of a chemical compound formed in the reaction of the substrate substance with anotherPhosphate Coating Basics Asterion IndianapolisZinc phosphate is primarily used for corrosion resistance (Phos &amp Oil),wear resistance,lubricity or as a base for subsequent coatings.It may be applied by spray or immersion.The phosphate coating,in itself,provides limited corrosion resistance and consequently is
