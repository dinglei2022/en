Steam can be raised quickly from water.2.It does not react much with materials.3.It is stable at temperatures required in the plant.LAYOUT OF STEAM POWER PLANT: The layout of steam power plant has the following circuits: 1.Fuel (Coal) and ash circuit.2.Air and flue gas circuit.3.Feed water and steam flow circuit.4.Chapter 8a: Ideal Rankine and Reheat Steam Power Cycles20191213&ensp&#0183&enspChapter 8: Steam Power Cycles a) Ideal Rankine and Reheat Cycles.We introduced the basic Steam Power Plant in Chapter 4b,however we could only evaluate the turbine and feedwater pump after we introduced the concept of entropy in Chapter 6a.In this Chapter we will consider ideal steam power cycles including isentropic turbines and pumps.

## What is the block diagram of a thermal power station? Quora
Actually,this is the simple overview of the Coal Fired Thermal Power Plant.This is the simple overview which gives a basic idea about the thermal power plants.From this figure i will explain how the conversion of coal to electricity is takingTVA How a Coal Plant WorksRiver water is pumped through tubes in a condenser to cool and condense the steam coming out of the turbines.The Kingston plant generates about 10 billion kilowatthours a year,or enough electricity to supply 700,000 homes.To meet this demand,Kingston burns about 14,000 tons of coal a day,an amount that would fill 140 railroad cars.
