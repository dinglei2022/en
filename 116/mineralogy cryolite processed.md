## Why is carbon used in the extraction of Aluminium.
During the electrolysis process.separating aluminium from oxygen in the oxide ores was overcome by the use of cryolite as a flux to dissolve the oxide mineral(s).As natural cryolite is too rare to be used for this purpose,synthetic sodium aluminium fluoride is produced from the common mineral fluorite.What is the inert electrode?

## Chromite: The mineral Chromite information and pictures
Chromite,the principle ore of the element chromium,is a commercially valuable mineral.However,due to mining restrictions and the fact that Chromite is not commonly found in crystallized form,it is not wellrepresented in mineral collections.
