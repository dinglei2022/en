## Technical Notes: The Sapphire Crystal Wound For
Due to its impressive hardness qualities,sapphire provides incredible scratch resistance when compared to acrylic or hardened mineral.However,as with many materials rating high on the Mohs scale,hardness often has an inverse relationship with brittleness making sapphire more prone to shattering.This is where acrylic has the advantage.Nucleation loion and propagation direction201918&ensp&#0183&enspXMOL,Ceramics International——Nucleation loion and propagation direction of radial and median cracks for brittle material in scratching,Xinying Li,Yufei Gao,Peiqi Ge,Lei Zhang,Wenbo Bi,Jianfeng Meng
