## the use of electrolysis in the extraction of metals
GCSE CHEMISTRY Copper Purifiion by Electrolysis Extraction of Metals Extraction of Copper Purifiion by Electrolysis High purity copper is needed to make electrical wir The anode is a block of impure copper The hode is a thin piece of pure copper The electrolyte is copper sulfate 3b Electrolytic extraction of the very reactive metalCopper mining.From ore to copper.SchoolScience.co.uk2014613&ensp&#0183&enspThe copper is recovered by electrolytic refining.Advantages of this process are: much less energy is use than in traditional mining no waste gases are given off it can be used on ores with as little as 0.1% copper for this reason,leaching extraction is growing in importance.

## Electrorefining of Copper Universidade Federal do Rio,
Virtually all copper produced from ore receives an electrolytic treatment at some stage either via electrorefining from impure anodes or electrowinning from leach or solvent extraction liquorsA new way of extracting copper MIT NewsThe closest industrial process to the electrolytic copper extraction they hope to see is aluminum production by an electrolytic process known as Hall Héroult process,which produces a pool of molten aluminum metal that can be continuously tapped
