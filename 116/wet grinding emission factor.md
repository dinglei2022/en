## Effect of grinding parameters on acoustic emission signals
Grinding process of engineering ceramics is always accompanied by cracking.For automation of machining process it is necessary that a reliable sensing system be devised to detect the workpiece cracking during grinding.In this paper an acoustic emission (AE) sensor was examined for inprocess detection of workpiece conditions.Chapter 7.Chips,Sawdust,Planer Shavings,Bark,and2005726&ensp&#0183&enspChapter 7.Chips,Sawdust,Planer Shavings,Bark,and Hog Fuel Previous chapters have presented material balances that can be used to estimate the fraction of a log recovered in a residue form.There are many factors that affect chip and residue measures and
