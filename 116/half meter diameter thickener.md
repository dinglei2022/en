## Radius,Diameter,Circumference,and Area of Circles dummies
With the measure of the radius,you can tell a lot about the circle: its diameter (the distance from one side to the other,passing through the center),its circumference (how far around it is),and its area (how many square inches,feet,yards,meters — what have you — fit into it)Mini columns and ghost columns in Columbia River lava,The secondary mini columns grow into the main columns and are clearly younger than them They are small adjacent to the master joint,but merge together and thicken away from the fracture toward the master column interior Commonly the mini columns are one half meter in length and 2 12 cm in diameter
