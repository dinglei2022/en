## What is the mix ratio for grade 20 concrete answers
Concrete hardens as a result of the chemical reaction between cement and water so that for every 4 lbs of cement 1 lb of water is needed.The ratio is therefore 1:4 or 20%.Concrete Mix Design Different Grades of ConcreteThe grade of concrete is also denoted as C16 20,C20 25,C25 30,etc,which means Concrete Strength Class (C) the number behind C refers to Compressive strength of Concrete in N mm 2 when tested with Cylinder Cube
