sauconite (a zinc bearing clay mineral),smithsonite (zinc carbonate),and hemimorphite (zinc silicate).The elevated silica levels and the presence of halides,together with challenges in upgrading the zinc ore,resulted in a delay in developing a processing route that includes direct leaching of the ore,purification via a solvent extraction.EVALUATION OF PROCESSING OPTIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF …The main minerals are sauconite (a zinc bearing clay mineral),smithsonite (zinc carbonate),and hemimorphite (zinc silicate).The elevated silica levels and the presence of halides and challenges to upgrade the zinc ore resulted in a delay in developing a processing route that includes direct leaching of the ore,purification with via a solvent extraction process and conventional.

## Minerals MDPI
Zn bearing phyllosilicates are common minerals in nonsulfide Zn deposits,but they seldom represent the prevailing economic species.However,even though the presence of Zn bearing clays is considered as a disadvantage in mineral processing,their characteristics can give crucial information on the genesis of the oxidized mineralization.Supergene Nonsulfide Zinc Lead Deposits: The Examples of.Sauconite is derived from a typical process of supergene wall rock replacement and alteration,represented by the reaction: K feldspar (detrital) → sericite illite and kaolinite (hydrothermal) → sauconite (supergene); sericite illite and kaolinite are enriched in zinc at the reaction boundaries with the replacing sauconite,this pointing to.
