## Amorphization by Mechanical Milling for Making IR
Both X‐ray diffraction and DSC techniques were used to demonstrate that the original Ge 15 Ga 20 S 65 composition can be prepared in the amorphous state by using mechanical milling starting from raw metallic elements.Subsequent hot‐pressing by spark plasma sintering in a graphite die above the glass transition temperature leads to sinteredSYNTHESIS AND MICROSTRUCTURE DESIGN OF METAL ANDMechanical milling of powder mixtures results in mutual dispersion of the components and leads to grain refinement and formation of defect structures,which are responsible for enhanced chemical reactivity of milled solids.Through altering the initial state of solid reactants or phase constituents of a composite material,mechanical milling
