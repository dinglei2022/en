2019716&ensp&#0183&enspThe 2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill was a leak of cyanide near Baia Mare,Romania,into the Someș River by the gold mining company Aurul,a jointventure of the Australian company Esmeralda Exploration and the Romanian government.The polluted waters eventually reached the Tisza and then the Danube,killing large numbers of fish in Hungary,Serbia and Romania.Ore processing Waihi GoldOre processing consists of the following stages: crushing and grinding of the ore addition of process water (generally decanted from the tailings pond) to form a slurry addition of lime to the ore,and cyanide solution to the slurry,to leach the gold and silver into solution

## History Gold Hill Mesa Life
Cyanide is often mentioned as part of the process used at the former Golden Cycle Mill.Although a cyanide solution was a common method used by all gold and silver mills at the time (including at the Golden Mill) to separate gold and silver from the rock,these chemicals were contained in tanks.Cyanide Wikipedia2019729&ensp&#0183&enspA cyanide is a chemical compound that contains the group C≡N.This group,known as the cyano group,consists of a carbon atom triplebonded to a nitrogen atom.[1] In inorganic cyanides,the cyanide group is present as the anion CN−.Salts such as sodium cyanide and potassium cyanide are highly toxic.[2] Hydrocyanic acid,also known as
