## Milling Speed and Feed Calculator
Milling operations remove material by feeding a workpiece into a rotating cutting tool with sharp teeth,such as an end mill or face mill.Calculations use the desired tool diameter,number of teeth,cutting speed,and cutting feed,which should be chosen based on the specific cutting conditions,including the workpiece material and tool material.Milling formulas and definitions sandvik.coromantThe milling process definitions Cutting speed,v c Indies the surface speed at which the cutting edge machines the workpiece.Effective or true cutting speed,v e Indies the surface speed at the effective diameter (DC ap).This value is necessary for determining the true cutting data at the actual depth of cut (a p).This is a particularly important value when using round insert cutters
