## Waffle Slab Structural engineering general discussion
The book goes through calculations for tee beams and ribbed slabs but not waffle slabs.I have not perused the book sufficiently to answer all of your questions about shear,but the book presents fairly detailed calculations and might be useful for your present purpose.BAWhat's the difference between waffle and raft slabs?Waffle slabs consist of an edge beam (perimeter footing) and selectively spaced internal beams that run each way.Polystyrene is used in between the beams to form voids where concrete is poured.This process creates a 'waffle' like aesthetic when viewed from underneath,hence the name.
