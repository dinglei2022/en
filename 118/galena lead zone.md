Galena's history began in 1871,when the railway was built through what is now Galena.But only in 1876 did the town appear,when mineral containing lead was discovered in the area.It was incorporated in 1877 and is the oldest mining town in Kansas.Galena Mineral Uses and Properties GeologyGalena is a lead sulfide mineral with a chemical composition of PbS.It is the world's primary ore of lead and is mined from a large number of deposits in many countries.It is found in igneous and metamorphic rocks in medium to lowtemperature hydrothermal veins.
