## difference between open cast mining and underground …
OPEN CAST MINING When minerals and deposits are found close to the surface and spread across a large distance,the best way to mine is to use the open cut mining method.In this process,the area is cleared of all topsoil and vegetation,this material is stockpiled and used later when rehabilitating the area once mining is finished.Surface Mining Methods and Equipment16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;1.1.Classification of Surface Mining Methods 1.2.Open Pit vs.Underground Mining Methods 1.3.Open Pit Mining 1.4.Open Cast Mining 1.5.Placer Mining 1.6 Solution Mining 2.Surface Mining Machinery Glossary Bibliography Biographical Sketches Summary This chapter deals with surface mining.Section 1 presents an overview of surface mining
