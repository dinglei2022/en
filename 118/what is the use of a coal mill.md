## Coal Mill
In China and India in particular,coastal power stations tend to mill coal more finely,use superior emissions to control technologies,and have a tendency to use higher quality coal blends.The result is higher quality and greater consistency in fly ash chemical and physical properties,to the extent that the material is more desirable to.Ball millA ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotati
