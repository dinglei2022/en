## Miller process GoldRefiningWiki
The Miller chlorine process is a refining process used to refine large amounts of gold with chlorine gas.When chlorine gas is injected into molten gold the chlorine forms chlorides with less noble metals.The chlorides can then be easily removed as they will not alloy with the gold.simple gold mining equipment2021 10 22 The two gold refining methods most commonly employed to derive pure gold are: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process The Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point; impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified gold The Miller process is rapid and simple.
