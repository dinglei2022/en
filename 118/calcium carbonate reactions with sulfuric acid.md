## Science questions: Acid + Carbonate = what reaction? How
Acid + Carbonate = what reaction? This is not always easy,because many reactions take place but do not show any visible signs of them happening.However,in the case of hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate,the reaction is easy to see because the calcium carbonate starts to fizz and release a gas (carbon dioxide) the calcium carbonateSCIENTIFIC PAPER Effects of Sodium Silie,Calciumof silicic acid to a fertilizer solution with a dilution material such as calcium carbonate and sodium silie,and its effects on the amount of sulfuric acid,are investigated analytically in

## What happens when acid reacts with limestone? Questions
Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3).This is not very soluble,so rocks don't dissolve very quickly.But if you add an acid,you add hydrogen ions (H+),which will react with the carbonate to form hydrogen carbonate HCO3 ions,which are very soluble in water,and the limestone will dissolve.Or,if there is more acid,two hydrogen ions willkinetics calcium hydroxide sulfuric acidreaction calcium carbonate and sulfuric acid to form sulfuric acid calcium hydroxide gypsum kinetics beltconveyers.net.Word eqation for the reaction between calcium carbonate and which reacts with calcium hydroxide and calcium aluminate in the cement to form gypsum
