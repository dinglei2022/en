## What's the Difference Between 3 axis,4 axis & 5 axis,
Nov 10,2020&#0183;&#32;5 Axis machining These CNC milling machines utilise 2 of the 3 possible rotation axis,depending on the type of machine A machine will either utilise a rotation in the A axis and C axis,or a rotation in the B axis and C axis The rotation either occurs by the workpiece,or by the spindle5 axis CNC machine Wiki MachineFive axis machining refers to the fact that there are at least five axes (three linear coordinates and two rotational coordinates) on one machine,and can be coordinated at the same time under the control of a computer numerical control (CNC) system Five axis machining machine with vertical,horizontal and cradle type two axis NC table,NC table NC dividing head,NC table 90 axis,NC table.
