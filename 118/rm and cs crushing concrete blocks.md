## Ways to Recycle and Reuse Concrete
Concrete is recycled by using industrial crushing equipment with jaws and large impactors.After the concrete is broken up,it is usually run through a secondary impactor and is then screened to remove dirt and particles and to separate the large and small aggregate.Laying Bricks and Blocks Brickwork and Blockwork Bonds …Concrete and lightweight blocks are widely used in all areas of building and DIY.They can be bought with a “Fair face” for work which will be visibly seen.They are much quicker to lay given that 1 standard block is equivalent to 6 bricks (For buying purposes there are 10 blocks to the square meter when the block is 440mm x 215mm).
