## Types of Metamorphism cliffsnotes
The different groups of minerals,or assemblages,that crystallize and are stable at the different pressure and temperature ranges during regional metamorphism distinguish distinct metamorphic grades,or faces.The grades are usually named for the dominant minerals or colors that identify them (Figure 1).Figure 1.Regional Metamorphic Rock FaciesWhy might metamorphic rock be more likely to show bands of,Dec 21,2008&#0183;&#32;The layering within metamorphic rocks is called "Foliation" Foliation is when layers of other rocks are being compressed during recrystallization Usually these rocks are different colors and appear to have colored bands running across the rock Igneous rocks don't do this because they are made from lava from the mantle and volcanic eruption

Schist is a foliated metamorphic rock made up of plate shaped mineral grains that are large enough to see with an unaided eye It usually forms on a continental side of a convergent plate boundary where sedimentary rocks,such as shales and mudstones,have been subjected to compressive forces,heat,and chemical activity This metamorphic environment is intense enough to.

ReferenceThere is an unwritten third type of igneous rock that is technically extrusive,but it differs from other extrusive rocks because the lava cools instantly,forming a glasslike texture.There are many ways scientists describe igneous rocks,which have four different types of mineral composition: felsic,intermediate,mafic and ultramafic.
