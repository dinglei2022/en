## How to Make AirCrete Domegaia
Mix one 94lb bag of cement with 6 gallons (US) water.Put all the water in your container first and add the cement while you are mixing to avoid clumping.When the cement and water are well mixed,turn on the Little Dragon and add foam to the mixture.Add enough foam to make a total of 45 gallons of AirCrete.That's about 30&quot high in a standard 55 gallon drum.TINY CEMENT PLANT TECHNOLOGY TinyTech PlantsCement industry in India is highly centralized capital intensive industry with giant plants with one million tonne per annum capacity of each plant.Such 97 cement plants producing 97 million tonnes of cement are owned by 47 families only.Each such giant plant requires investment of Rs 900 crores of rupees.Entire cement industry is highly exploitative draining the wealth of 5 lakh crores of
