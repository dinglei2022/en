The impacts of vegetation fires on ecosystems are complex and varied affecting a range of important ecosystem services.Fire has the potential to affect the physicochemical and ecological status of water systems,alter several aspects of the carbon cycle (e.g.above and belowground carbon storage) and trigger changes in vegetation type and structure.The Benefits and Effects of Limestone SciencingLimestone,applied as a slurry,which is a mixture of minutely crushed limestone and water,helps to prevent sulfur dioxide from escaping through the plant's smokestack.The limestone traps the sulfur dioxide gas in the wet slurry with calcium and oxygen and makes the pollutant a removable solid waste.
