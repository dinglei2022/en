1.Introduction.In the United States,heavy metals are prevalent at almost all sites targeted by major remediation programs.For instance,metals are present in 77% of the Superfund sites (National Priorities List),in 72% of the Department of Defense (DOD) sites and in 55% of the Department of Energy (DOE) sites.The USEPA estimates that over 50 million cubic meters of soil at current NPL.Silica mineral processing and Magnetic separationSilica mineral processing and purifiion process introduction.According to the occurrence state of impurities and inclusions of silica mineral raw materials,the beneficiation process mainly consists of scrubbing magnetic separation flotation acid leaching process.And with the mineral processing research unceasingly thorough,our country has introduced the electric separation and

## Industrial quartz sand
Magnetic separation.Magnetic separation is mainly used to remove magnetic minerals in quartz sand,such as the removal of weak magnetic minerals such as hematite,limonite,and biotite through a strong magnetic machine,while strong magnetic minerals,such as magnetite,can be removed by a weak magnetic separator.A Beneficiation Study on a Low Grade Iron Ore by …Scrubbing and de sliming stages increased the recovery in the wet high intensity magnetic process.With a four stage process of separation,the WHIMS by scrubbing and de sliming was applied to achieve a final concentrate with grade of 62.6% Fe and recovery of 57.1% Fe.

## Magnetic Separation
Magnetic separation: based on the generation of magnetic forces on the particles to be separated,which are higher than opposing forces such as gravity or centrifugal forces.This principle is used to separate ferromagnetic particles from crushed scrap mixtures.• Eddy current separation: is a particular form of magnetic separation.An.Dense Medium Separation An Effective and Robust Preconsisted of the unit operations of crushing,scrubbing,screening,dense medium separation,magnetic separation,filtration,and dewatering.A larger,25 tonne,sample was initially tested in various stages,along with intermediate size reduction and further concentration by magnetic separation.Based
