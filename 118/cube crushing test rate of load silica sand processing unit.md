## Building Material Testing
Any one of a number of methods of measuring creep,for example,by subjecting a material to a constant stress or deforming it at a constant rate is called creep test.Creep in compression (CIC) refers to the percent of shrinkage of a refractory test piece under a constant load and exposed to a constant high temperature over a long period of time.compressive strength of concrete vs time graphCompressive strength is an effective way of measuring how much load a surface or material can bear.The test for this sort of strength is performed by exerting force downward on top of the object,paired with an equal and opposite force exerted upward on the bottom.Get price
