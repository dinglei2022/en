## Drilling Wikipedia
2019731&ensp&#0183&enspDrilling is a cutting process that uses a drill bit to cut a hole of circular crosssection in solid materials.The drill bit is usually a rotary cutting tool,often multipoint.The bit is pressed against the workpiece and rotated at rates from hundreds to thousands of revolutions per minute.This forces the cutting edge against the workpiece,cutting off chips (swarf) from the hole as it isAutomatic tool changer Wikipedia2019717&ensp&#0183&enspAn Automatic tool changer or ATC is used in computerized numerical control (CNC) machine tools to improve the production and tool carrying capacity of the machine.ATC changes the tool very quickly,reducing the nonproductive time.Generally,it is used to improve the capacity of the machine to work with a number of tools.
