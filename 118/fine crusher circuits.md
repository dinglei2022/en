## Secondary crushing: worth the cost? Ausenco
Without secondary crushing,the SAG mill based circuit tends to be energy inefficient,with low throughput and a fine mill product.This is accompanied by large.Vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushersAccurate shaping capabilities and acceptance of fines make Barmac&#174; B Series™ VSI crushers excellent for manufactured sand production.Rock on rock crushing ensure low operating costs,and whenever more reduction is needed,or the feed is coarse,the crusher can be equipped with metallic anvils.
