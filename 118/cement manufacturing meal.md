A rawmill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into &quot;rawmix&quot; during the manufacture of cement.Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln,which transforms it into clinker,which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The rawmilling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical&nbsp;.Utilization of steel slag for Portland cement clinker production. NCBI2 Aug 2007.The aim of the present research work is to investigate the possibility of adding steel slag,a by product of the conversion of iron to steel process,in the raw meal for the production of Portland cement clinker.Two samples of raw meals were prepared,one with ordinary raw materials,as a reference sample&nbsp;.

Cement Manufacturing Process History of Cement: Cement is a material which is highly compatible to the earth’s eco system and most adaptable to sustainable development.Cement is a fine powder which sets after a few hours when mixed with water,and then hardens into a solid,strong material.J.K.Cement :: Grey Cement Manufacturing ProcessThe production process for cement consists of drying,grinding and mixing limestone and additives like bauxite and iron ore into a powder known as &quot;raw meal&quot;.The raw meal is then heated and burned in a pre heater and kiln and then cooled in an air cooling system to form a semi finished product,known as a clinker.
