## Characterizing amorphous silies in extraterrestrial
The same naming rule applies for crystalline and amorphous silies as well as for silie melts [Klein et al.2002].Amorphous silies in extraterrestrial materials could form through primary volcanism or secondary processes (e.g.hydrothermal alteration,impact,and radiation damage) [Rampe et al.2014].The determination of NBO TWhat is silica Levasil Colloidal Silica NouryonWhat's the difference between sodium silie (water glass) and colloidal silica? Colloidal silica consists of dense,amorphous particles of SiO 2.The building blocks of these particles are randomlydistributed [SiO 4]tetrahedra.This random distribution is what makes amorphous silica different from crystalline silica ordered on a molecular
