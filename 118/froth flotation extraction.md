## Processing Spodumene by Froth Flotation for Lithium Extraction
Spodumene theoretically contains 8.03% Li2O and therefore the production of this mineral is greatly increasing because of the expanded use of lithium in the manufacture of high temperature insoluble lubricants,ceramics,pyrotechnics,nonferrous welding fluxes,air purifying agents,and hydrogen isotopes.Extracting Lithium from its Ore The problems of spodumene mineralCopper mining.From ore to copper. School ScienceCopper can be extracted from its ore by: 1.Traditional.The ore is crushed,ground and then enriched (concentrated) by Froth Flotation.The powdered ore is.

## What is Froth Flotation?
Nov 07,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Froth flotation is a process using air bubbles to separate materials based on their relative affinity to water.Bubbles carry reagent and hydrophobic materials to the top of a tank where they can be removed.Froth flotation has been used for more than a century in mining operations to separate valuable materials from excavated ores.60 Centuries of Copper: The Flotation ProcessThe Flotation Process.Until quite recently copper ore had to be handpicked if the extraction of the metal was to be economical.In fact,in the last century,ores of 4 percent grade were regarded as almost valueless.
