## What is direct reduced iron (DRI)? definition and meaning
direct reduced iron (DRI): Alternative iron source produced by heating an iron ore (generally having 65 to 70 percent iron) at a temperature high enough to burn off its carbon and oxygen content (a process called reduction) but below iron's melting point(1535&#176C or 2795&#176F).The output is sold as pellets or briquettes (called hot briquetted ironDirect Reduced Iron Industrial Efficiency TechnologyDirect Reduced Iron (DRI),also known as Sponge Iron,offers an alternative steel production route to BFBOF and ScrapEAF routes.In DRI,iron ore is reduced in its solid state unlike BF process where a liquid metal is formed during reduction.DRI can then be transformed to steel in electric arc furnaces.DRI production is common in Middle East,South America,India and Mexico.
