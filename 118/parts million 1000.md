## Partsper notation Wikipedia
2019627&ensp&#0183&enspIn science and engineering,the partsper notation is a set of pseudounits to describe small values of miscellaneous dimensionless quantities,e.g.mole fraction or mass fraction.Since these fractions are quantityperquantity measures,they are pure numbers with no associated units of measurement.Commonly used are ppm (partspermillionParts Per Million (PPM) WorkPlaceTestingThe definition of part in parts per million may vary based on what is being tested because it is a ratio in nature.However,it will be constant within that measuring situation.For example,parts per million (ppm) may be used in fluid testing to describe the ratio of a solute present in a solution.

## How to Calculate PPM Sciencing
Parts per million calculations are used for measuring small concentrations in a solution,solid and gas or the number of defects in manufacturing.The basic formula for PPM starts with dividing the weight or number of defects by the volume and then multiplying the result by 1,000,000.Parts per million (ppm) definition Northwestern UniversityJust as per cent means out of a hundred,so parts per million or ppm means out of a million.Usually describes the concentration of something in water or soil.One ppm is equivalent to 1 milligram of something per liter of water (mg l) or 1 milligram of something per kilogram soil (mg kg).
