## Humaninduced changes in recent sedimentation rates in
The average sedimentation rates of Bohai Bay exceeded 10 mm yr −1 before 1963,which was much higher than the rate of local sealevel rise.However,our results showed an overall decreasing sedimentation rate after 1963,which was not able to compensate for the increasing relative sealevel rise inSedimentation Marlborough District CouncilSedimentation of estuaries and seabed habitats is a natural process,caused by slips in native forest.However,our activities on land and in the sea have accelerated erosion rates and led to dramatically increased rates of sediment entering our waterways.
