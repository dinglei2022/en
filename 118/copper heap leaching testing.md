## Agglomeration technique improves heap leaching process
Copper heap leaching with agglomeration.Heap leaching relies on a leaching agent moving through a bed of heaped ore to extract the metallic components: Crushed ore is stacked on a leaching pad and irrigated with the leaching agent.The leaching agent chemically reacts with the metal in the ore to dissolve the copper into the solution as itCopper 99 Cobre 99: Short Courses tmsWho Should Attend: Copper heap and dump leaching contributes significantly to the production of copper from oxide and sulfide ores.This course offers an overview of the regulatory,theoretical and practical aspects of copper heap leaching.Much attention is given to the importance of ore testing and ore geochemical characteristics.
