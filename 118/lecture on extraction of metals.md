## Metallurgy Wikipedia
2019627&ensp&#0183&enspMetallurgy derives from the Ancient Greek μεταλλουργός,metallourg&#243s,&quotworker in metal" from μέταλλον,m&#233tallon,&quotmetal&quot + ἔργον,&#233rgon,&quotwork&quot.The word was originally an alchemist's term for the extraction of metals from minerals,the ending urgy signifying a process,especially manufacturing: it was discussed in this sense in the 1797 Encyclop&#230dia Britannica.O Level Chemistry: Metals Google Sites2019220&ensp&#0183&enspExtraction method is from the metal oxide for Carbon and Hydrogen,and the metal carbonate for Heating.Refer to TB for details on the reactions of metals.Note: Metals above hydrogen will react with dilute acids to produce hydrogen gas (they are more reactive and hence can displace hydrogen from solutions of acids).
