## How many bags of cement are required in 1m3 of M15? Quora
Answer (1 of 8): Hi So the design mix is M15 ie,1:2:4 Ratio sum = 1+2+4 = 7 Volume of concrete = 1 cubic metre ( wet volume ) Now dry volume of concrete = 45 55% increase in volume × wet volume Dry volume= 1×152 (assuming 52% increase in volume) Dry volume = 152 cubic meter * Cemen.how we calculate of Sand,cement and aggregate of M20,M20 (1 cement :15 sand :3 stone brick aggregate) To determine the proportions you have to perform mix design,for this you have to find out the spgr of cement,CA,FA,and water cement ratio.

concrete is mixture of cement sand and aggregate in fixed proportion and m15 is ordinary grade of concrete that is not used in RCC work it is only used in PCC work what is cement mortar ratio of m15 concrete,There are different types of grade of concrete like M 75,M10,M15,M20,M 25 and so on But in this topic we have to study about how many cement bags in m15 grade of concreteTop 30 Technical Interview question for civil site,09 12 2021&#0183;&#32;Cement consumption for neat cement putting work (Ghola marna) You must know these terms as a Billing engineers And the Consumption 44 kg per square meter Allowable wastage limit of steel for reconciliation for this you must know the CPWD norms Know how to control the Consumption and control the wastage
