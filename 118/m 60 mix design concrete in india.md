## Concrete Mix Design Procedure and Example IS456
201668&ensp&#0183&enspConcrete mix design is the process of finding the proportions of concrete mix in terms of ratios of cement,sand and coarse aggregates.For e.g.a concrete mix of proportions 1:2:4 means that cement,fine and coarse aggregate are in the ratio 1:2:4 or the mix contains one part of cement,two parts of fine aggregate and four parts of coarse aggregate.Evaluation of M35 and M40 grades of concrete by ACI,2016423&ensp&#0183&enspMix design is a process of specifying the mixture of ingredients required to meet anticipated properties of fresh and hardened concrete.Concrete mix design is a well established practice around the globe.The concrete mix design methods used in countries such as,Britain,India
