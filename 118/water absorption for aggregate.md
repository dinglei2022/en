## ASTM C128 15 Standard Test Method for Relative Density
The laboratory standard for absorption is that obtained after submerging dry aggregate for a prescribed period of time.Aggregates mined from below the water table commonly have a moisture content greater than the absorption determined by this test method,if used without opportunity to dry prior to use.Water Absorption of Aggregates Civil EngineeringProcedure to determine water absorption of Aggregates.i) The sample should be thoroughly washed to remove finer particles and dust,drained and then placed in the wire basket and immersed in distilled water at a temperature between 22 and 32 o C.

## Print Fingertip: Water absorption limits on aggregates
Water absorption limits on aggregates.Limits on aggregate water absorption are rare though they may be useful to link to an undesirable concrete property,such as freezethaw susceptibility,as water absorption is easily determined.Historically it is not known the sourceWater Absorption of Aggregates engineeringcivillimit of water absorption value of aggregate is.1% to 2% in road surface.Reply Link.suryakanta sahoo September 25,2017 at 9:08 am.Hi Murali Krishna As per BS 8007,page 17,clause 6.2.2,water absorption is less than 3% but it is also refer BS 882,BS 1047,BS 812 part2 after check all reference there is no result found.

## Water Absorption Test for course aggregate,fine aggregate
Water absorption gives an idea of strength of aggregate.Aggregates having more water absorption are more porous in nature and are generally considered unsuitable unless they are found to be acceptable based on strength,impact and hardness tests.Aggregate Water Absorption Test Tutorials Tips AggregateAggregate is a building material that is mixed in fixed proportion with other building materials Like: Cement and sand to produce concrete.Before using any kind of materials,we have to check the quality of that materials.Water Absorption Test.After unloading of metal,collect small quantities of metal from different parts of the heap.
