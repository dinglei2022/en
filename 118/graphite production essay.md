Graphite was first synthesized accidentally by Edward G.Acheson while he was performing hightemperature experiments on carborundum.He found that at about 4,150 &#176C (7,500 &#176F) the silicon in the carborundum vaporized,leaving the carbon behind in graphitic form.Acheson was granted a patent for graphite manufacture in 1896,and commercial production started in 1897.
