## Mining of Precious Metals and Minerals: Gold and Uranium
Mining of Precious Metals and Minerals: Gold and Uranium,Platinum,and Diamonds.Mining's contribution to the South African economy continues its long term decline.Gold's contribution to South Africa's GDP reached a peak of 16.7% in 1980,and had declined to only 1.3% in 2016.SEISMICITY IN BUSHVELD PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED ATWith increasing depth of mining,the level of seismic activity also increases.Unlike deep South African gold mines,where seismic events are mainly generated as shear type events on geological discontinuities,seismic activity on No.10 Shaft results from crush type and mixed mechanism type events.This paper ties to explain these phenomena.
