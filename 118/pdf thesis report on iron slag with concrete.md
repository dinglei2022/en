## Use of Steel Slag Aggregate in Pavements Report ,
Steel slag aggregate (SSA) is a byproduct of the production of steel in an electric arc furnace The high iron oxide content of the aggregate results in an aggregate that is very hard and very dense (SSA is 20 30% heavier than naturally occurring aggregates such as basalt and granite) It86 IRON AND STEEL SLAG USGSslag (GGBFS) Air cooled iron slag and steel slag are used primarily as aggregates in concrete (air cooled iron slag only); asphaltic paving,fill,and road bases; both slag types also can be used as a feed for cement kilns Almost all GGBFS is used as a partial substitute for portland cement in concrete mixes or in blended cements
