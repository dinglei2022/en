## The fracture characteristics of crushed limestone sand
The use of crushed sand as a fine aggregate has rapidly increased due to a shortage of river sand.Accordingly,research on crushed sand concrete is required.In this research,the fracture characteristics of crushed limestone sand concrete were experimentally investigated through aAn Investigation into the Use of Manufactured Sand as a 100 MDPIJun 2,2016 The influence of these characteristics on concrete workability and strength,when manufactured sand completely replaced natural sand in concrete,was investigated and modelled using artificial neural Note that from the first issue of 2016,MDPI journals use article numbers instead of page numbers.
