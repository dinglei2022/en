Romanechite is an important ore of manganese.Manganese is a strategically valuable metal since it is an essential ingredient in steel and other alloys.The mining term &quotwad&quot is used to indie ores that are a mixture of several manganese oxides such as psilomelane (romanechite),pyrolusite and others that are difficult to distinguish.Appliion of Barium ferroalloys&#183 Barium carbonate is used in glassmaking.Being a heavy element,barium increases the refractive indexand luster of the glass.The compound is also used to reduce leaks of Xrays from hode ray tubes (CRT) TV sets.&#183 Barium,typically as barium nitrate,is added to fireworks to impart them a
