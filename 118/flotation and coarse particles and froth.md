## Effect of Frother on Flotation at Different Particle Size 911 Metallurgist
The ability of frothers to perform optimally on different particle size ranges visually appears to be due to.Froth Flotation Department of Chemical EngineeringFroth flotation is a highly versatile method for physically separating particles.For both good coarse particle recovery and good selectivity,the PO frothers.

## (PDF) Effect of nanobubbles on the flotation of different
However,froth flotation is not efficient for treating ultrafine coal and coarse coal particles.Our previous funda mental test results demonstrated that cavitationgenerated nanobubbles around 700 nm in diameter can signifi cantly improve coal and phosphate flotation performance over
