Engineering is a term applied to the profession in which a knowledge of the mathematical and natural sciences,gained by study,experience,and practice,is applied to the efficient use of the materials and forces of nature.Engineers are the ones who have received professional training in pure and applied science.Before the middle of the 18th century,largescale construction work was usuallyConcrete Mix DesignConcrete mix design is a method of calculating right proportions of cement,sand,and aggregates for concrete to achieve target strength in structures.The Concrete mix design Concrete Mix = Cement:Sand:Aggregates.For a mix design of concrete,we have to follow various steps,calculations,and laboratory testing to find the right mix proportions.

Most civil engineering programs require students to take a course in reinforced concrete design.What sets the course at the University of Arkansas apart from others is that students must design,build,and test an 8.0 ft (2.4 m) long reinforced concrete beam.Concrete StructureConcrete structure can be made with many different ways.Some are given below: Plain Cement Concrete.Plain cement concrete is a hardened mass obtained from a mixture of cement,sand,gravel,and water in definite proportion.The concrete structure made by using the plain cement concrete has good compressive strength but very little tensile strength,thus limiting its use in construction.
