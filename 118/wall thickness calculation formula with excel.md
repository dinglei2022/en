## How to Calculate Minimum Wall Thickness Hunker
A 0.7752 inch minimum thickness multiplied by a 15 percent tolerance or 115 becomes 0.7752 x 1.15.This equals 0.89147 inches,or almost 0.9 inch minimum pipe wall thickness.If a safety factor of two was required,the minimum thickness of 0.7752 x 2 would give a minimum wall thicknessFormula to calculate thickness from size schedule …I am new to excel world and trying to learn excel formulas.I have thickness data against size schedule in an excel file as below First column represents the size while the first row is the thickness.I need a formula to calculate thickness against size schedule.For.
