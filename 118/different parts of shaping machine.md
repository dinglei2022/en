## Machining Material removal processes
Machining is a term used to describe a variety of material removal processes in which a cutting tool removes unwanted material from a workpiece to produce the desired shape The workpiece is typically cut from a larger piece of stock,which is available in a variety of standard shapes,such as flat sheets,solid bars,hollow tubes,and shaped beamsWhat Are the Parts of Lathe Machine?
