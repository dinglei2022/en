## Purifiion of nickel sulfate by crystallization
The aim of this thesis was to examine solubility and crystallization of nickel sulfate in order to utilize industrial process solution for nickel recovery.The experiments were carried out with the involvement of typical process impurities Cl,Mg2+ and Na+ ions.EP2832700A1 Method for producing high purity nickel,In the carbonation step,a carbonating agent is added to an in process nickel containing material,particularly,an in process nickel containing solution (for example,a crude nickel sulfate solution) to precipitate nickel as nickel carbonate or a mixture of nickel carbonate and nickel hydroxide

## Chemical reclaiming of nickel sulfate from nickelbearing
Two types of nickelbearing wastes,spent Raney nickel (65% Ni) and segregated electroplated coatings (20% Ni),were used in this nickel reclaiming process study for nickel sulfate recovery.The spent alyst from the petrochemical industry was first roasted with caustic soda at 500&#176C to convert its alumina to watersoluble aluminate.Nickel sulfate NiSO4 PubChemNickel Sulfate is a yellow,green or blue colored,crystalline inorganic compound that produces toxic gases upon heating Nickel sulfate is used in electroplating and as a chemical intermediate to produce other nickel compounds Exposure to this substance can cause severe dermatitis,skin and asthma like allergies and affects the lungs,
