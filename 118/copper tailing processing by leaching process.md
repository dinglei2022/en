## Development of a Combined Flotation and High Pressure
201753&ensp&#0183&enspThe present study focused on the reprocessing of copper and nickel from mine tailings.In this work,recovery of copper and nickel from mine tailing by combined process of flotation and high pressure oxidative leaching were considered.In the first stage,effects of flotation parameters including collector type,collector dosage,and pH and pulp density were examined.Mineral processing valves (SchuF.18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Activox Process for Copper &amp; Nickel Key Process Steps ? Fine grinding of the feed stock ? Pressure oxidation of the fine ground material (at 110&#176;C 1000 kPa) ? The solids and liquids from the last step are separated and washed ? Iron is removed in a
