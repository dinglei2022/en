## Role of manganese dioxide in the recovery of oxide
In this article,the role of MnO 2 in the recovery of oxide sulphide zinc ore discussed.Through adopting various modern analysis techniques (such as Xray diffraction pattern,Xray photoelectron spectroscopy,scanning electron microscope,energy dispersive Xray analysis,and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy),the function and mechanism of MnO 2 during the phase transformationWhat's the Role of Flotation Froth in the FlotationThe main purpose of flotation froth is to gather hydrophilic minerals,improve mineral processing precision and decrease the difficulty of mineral processing.For example,copper,lead processing are much easier to achieve highquality and high efficient separation.Froth plays a very important role in the flotation process.Because of these
