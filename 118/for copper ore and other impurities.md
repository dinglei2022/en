On the other hand,many copper plants make no payment whatever for lead,as the lead is driven off as fume Plants having accessory equipment for recovery of the fume,make only small payments because the lead that is saved is in a form that is very expensive to re treat and also contains large quantities of undesirable impurities such as arsenicAnalysis: Iron ore impurities penalties surge on,Singapore â Penalties for alumina and silica content in iron ore have soared since January this year,due to a resurgence in the supply of ores with higher impurities and a subsequent lackluster response in demand In the medium grade iron ore fines bracket of 60% 635% Fe,Platts assessed the 1% silica penalty at a historical high of $480.
