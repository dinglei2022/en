## Pyrite Group: Mineral information,data and localities.
Group of isostructural sulphide species sharing the Pa3 space group,with a diploidal structure in which the &quotA&quot atoms occupy a facecentred cubic lattice position and the &quotX&quot atoms are in dumbbelllike pairs parallel to the four cube diagonals of the lattice,with each &quotA&quot atom surrounded by six &quotX&quot atoms in octahedral coordination each pair of &quotX&quot atoms coordinated to six &quotA&quot atoms.MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES OF AUTHIGENICAggregate and crystal morphology of authigenic pyrite collected in 1989 from the South Yellow Sea were studied with a binocular microscope,reflecting microscope and an

## BGS Lexicon of Named Rock Units Result Details
The top of the London Clay Formation is taken as the top of the Claygate Member,which is distinguished from the overlying Bagshot Formation by containing finer sand without crossbedding and in the relative abundance of clay and silt in the Claygate Member.Thickness: Up to 150m in eastern part of the London Basin (Essex).Geographical Limits:striking sparks with iron pyrite and file PaleoPlanetA student had given me a tiny piece of coarse grained pyrite like you find in a tourist shop.I used a piece of rhyolite on it,and I got more sparks but still no success.To compare I pulled out my flint and steel.The sparks coming off the file are huge compared to the pyrite and caught the char cloth immediately.
