2012418&ensp&#0183&enspWell,sulfides,selenides and tellurides are simply minerals which contain sulfur,selenium,and tellurium combined with some metal.Unusually this is the metal we are interested in,but sometimes other valuable metals can be mixed in as trace elements.An example of this is when gold occurs disbursed through a crystal of pyrite.The Mineral Gallery Sulfides ClassThe Sulfide Class minerals comprise an economically important class of minerals.Most major ores of important metals such as copper,lead and silver are sulfides.Strong generalities exist in this class.The majority of sulfides are metallic,opaque,generally sectile,soft to average in hardness and they have high densities,black or darkcolored streaks,and an igneous origin.
