## CHAPTER 9 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF LIGHTWEIGHT CONCRETE
1 Chapter 6 Physical Properties of Structural Lightweight Concrete The information present in Chapter 6 and 7 is also covered in a more general way in: ACI 213R “Guide for Structural Lightweight Aggregate Concrete” and ASTM 169 D “Lightweight Concrete and Aggregates”How to Make Lightweight Concrete HunkerLightweight concrete may not be as structurally sound as traditional concrete,but it can be useful in some projects where weight is more important than strength.To make this concrete,combine 8 parts cement,sand and lightweight aggregate with 5 parts water.
