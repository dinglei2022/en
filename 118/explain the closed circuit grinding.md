## (PDF) Effect of circulating load and classifiion
Both ball mills and HPGRs are typically used in closed circuit with classifiers.There is a general consensus within the industry that classifiion efficiency and circulating load both have a major effect on the efficiency of closed circuit ball mills.The fundamentals of grinding behavior are also discussed in order to explain theAMIT 135: Lesson 5 Crushing Mining Mill Operator TrainingCrushing Equipment.The selection of the right crushing equipment is influenced by many factors some of which are upstream of the crushing plant (e.g.blasting pattern and mining method) and others which are downstream of the crushing plant (e.g.mill and grinding circuit selection).
