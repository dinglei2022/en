## Coal pollution mitigation Wikipedia
Coal pollution mitigation,often called clean coal,is a series of systems and technologies that seek to mitigate the pollution and other environmental effects normally associated with the burning (though not the mining or processing) of coal,which is widely regarded as the dirtiest of the common fuels for industrial processes and power generationASSESSMENT OF NOISE POLLUTION AND MITIGATION,The noise is coming out mainly from the gas turbine of thermal power plant As,already studied the efficiency of green belt in the mitigation of noise pollution (Rao et al,2004,Krag,1979,Cook,1977) The main mechanism associated in the mitigation of noise level by the plants includes the absorption of acoustic energy by its leaves.

## Air pollution from coal power plants Greenpeace
Greenpeace exposes coal industry air pollution and the harm it does to our health,and communies this to the world.We push governments in many countries to strengthen their air quality standards and coal fired power plant emission standards.We fight to stop new power plants from being built.NRC: Mitigation StrategiesThe NRC issued a Mitigation Strategies Order on March 12,2012,requiring all US nuclear power plants to implement strategies that will allow them to cope without their permanent electrical power sources for an indefinite amount of time These strategies must keep the reactor core and spent fuel cool,as well as protect the thick concrete.
