## Metal Extraction Process for High Grade Stibnite of Kharan,
Mineralogical composition of the stibnite ore was confirmed by X ray diffraction analysis and diffraction pattern is illustrated in Figure 1 All the peaks were matched by the search match program using Xpert High Score Plus Software which reveals that the ore predominantly consists of stibnite (Sb 2S 3) ie 66%,whereas 6% senarmontite (Sb 2OMignone Halls of Gems and Minerals AMNHStibnite (Sb2S3),a compound of the elements antimony and sulfur,occasionally forms nests of delicate,swordlike crystals,but examples this large and intricate are exceedingly rare Water Wonder Hydrothermal processes like the one that formed this stibnite require hot water,which dissolves mineral components and transports them along.

## Chemistry of Stibnite,Orpiment and Other Sulfide Minerals,
A representative brine of moderately challenging composition is put through several typical power generating cycles,allowing chemical behavior of Sb,As,Fe,Zn,Pb and other deposit forming metals to be compared Stibnite and Orpiment are the primary focus,but results related to other sulfide minerals and more common deposits including CaCO 3In situ determination of antimony isotope ratios in Sb,For MAC stibnite,natural in origin,and metal MET,it is unclear if other stibnite grains or metals provided by the companies will have the same Sb isotope composition Thus,we preferred to use our stibnite SC as a solid standard for LA MC ICP MS (or other in situ) Sb isotope analys For this standard,more than 11 parts of fused material.
