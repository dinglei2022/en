## Study on Compressive Strength of Quarry Dust as Fine,
Jul 28,2016&#0183;&#32;The concept of replacement of natural fine aggregate by quarry dust which is highlighted in the study could boost the consumption of quarry dust generated from quarri By replacement of quarry dust,the requirement of land fill area can be reduced and can also solve the problem of natural sand scarcity The availability of sand at low cost as a fine aggregate in concrete is not suitable and.Lightweight aggregate concrete produced with crushed,desert sand with crushed stone sand was investigated in terms of the fresh and hardened concrete characteristics of the resulting LWAC Concrete mixtures incorporating various levels of LWA manufactured from expanded clay as coarse aggregate and crushed stone sand as fine aggregate were tested for strength and durability characteristics and.
