## Mining and Refining Process World Aluminium
The Bayer Process was invented and patented in 1887 by Austrian scientist Karl Josef Bayer.Two to three tonnes of bauxite are required to produce one tonne of alumina.90% of the global alumina supply of around 90 million tonnes is used in aluminium production.The Process of Mining Bauxite Dajcor27 02 2019&#0183;&#32;Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation Milling: Several meters of rock and clay are removed by blasting,drilling,and bulldozers The bauxite is then transported to the crushing and washing area,reducing the particle size and increasing the available surface area for the digestion stage
