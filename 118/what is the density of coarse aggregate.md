If the particles are of the same size,then it can be packed to a limited extent but when the smaller particles are added,the voids get filled with them and thus the bulk density increases.For a coarse aggregate,a higher bulk density means that there are few voids which are to be filled by the fine aggregate and cement.Aggregate (composite) Wikipedia201975&ensp&#0183&enspAggregate is the component of a composite material that resists compressive stress and provides bulk to the composite material.For efficient filling,aggregate should be much smaller than the finished item,but have a wide variety of sizes.For example,the particles of stone used to make concrete typically include both sand and gravel.
