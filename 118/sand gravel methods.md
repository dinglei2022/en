## Ground Survey Methods for Mixed Sand and Gravel Beaches
Mixed sand and gravel beaches,as well as gravel beaches,are distinct from sandy beaches in that they often have multiple steep (&gt20&#176 or 1 : 4) berms on the upper part of the beach and shortwavelength (&lt20 m) longshore variations in the form of beach cusps or in close proximity to groynes.Environmental Effects of Sand and Gravel Mining on Land2017819&ensp&#0183&enspThe increase in the demand for sand and gravel for construction and other purposes such as flood control has placed immense pressure on the environment where sand and gravel resources occur.This study was carried out to determine the environmental effects of sand and gravel mining in Luku,North central Nigeria,using field observations and laboratory analysis of soil samples.
