## Concrete Calculator
Cement is a substance that is used to bind materials,such as aggregate,by adhering to said materials,then hardening over time.While there are many types of cement,Portland cement is the most commonly used cement,and is an ingredient in concrete,mortar,and plasters.Calculate Cement Sand & Aggregate M20,M15,M10,M5,Calculate the concrete quantity required in cubic meter and then multiply the quantity with the cement sand and aggregate for 1 cubic meter of concrete In your case Volume of concrete = 17 x 17 x 05 = 14 cum It looks like you are using m20 grade mix with extra sand If you follow that mix proportion then to calculate use this following.
