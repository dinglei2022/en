## Alloys What are they? What are common alloys made from?
Jun 8,2017 You might see the word alloy described as a &quotmixture of metals" but that&#39s a little bit misleading because some alloys contain only one metal and it&#39s mixed in with other substances that are nonmetals (cast iron,for example,is an alloy made of just one metal,iron,mixed with one nonmetal,carbon).The best&nbspBronze Tinkers' Construct Wiki FANDOM powered by Wikia2019822&ensp&#0183&enspBronze is an alloy created by combining Molten Copper and Tin in a Smeltery in a 3:1 ratio this yields 4 Bronze ingots.It can be used for tools,and is also required to craft ExoArmor (dev build 1.5.3d1 and up).Bronze was about equal to Iron.For pickaxes,it was on the same level,but has a

## Bronze Wikipedia
Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper,commonly with about 12% tin and often with the addition of other metals and sometimes nonmetals or metalloids such as arsenic,phosphorus or silicon.These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone,or have other useful properties,such as&nbspSimple Soda Can Concrete Made By Barb easy poured concreteJul 17,2017 You will need: soda cans (I make a few at a time) RapidSet Cementall Rubber gloves &amp Dust mask,gloves for hand protection Mixing container,utensil,water strong scissors or tin snips pliers of some sort stick or broom handle (will not be destroyed) acrylic paints to finish&nbsp
