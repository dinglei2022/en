## What is the weight of one cubic meter M20 concrete?
The Question is mistake.The Question is How much sand and aggregate required for the one cubic meter of M20 grade concrete? Answer : 20mm aggregate = 0.90M3 Sand =Practical Method for Mix Design of Cementbased GroutFor the appliion in soil improvement,the cementbased grout mix is recommended to utilize well graded sand [3].The volumetric ratio of cement : sand of 1 : 2 can be used as long as the sand passes a 1.20 mm sieve,with the amount of sand that passes 0.15 mm is above 15%.
