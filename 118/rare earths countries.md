## USChina trade war opens a market for African rare earth
The USChina trade dispute has never been just about trade.At stake is US continued control of its technology as China emerges as a rival superpower.Access to rare earths will be a key part of that struggle,opening opportunities in African countries that are able to provide supply.Rare earthsWill Beijing weaponise its rare earth supply in the USJun 28,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Global rare earth reserves are estimated to total 120 million metric tonnes.With demand for rare earth minerals ramping up,it will be interesting to see how countries like Malaysia,with an estimated 30,000 metric tonnes of reserves,will contribute to supply in the future.
