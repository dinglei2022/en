## Coal Beneficiation Technology 2007 Initiatives,Policies,
Coal beneficiation is a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved by either reducing the extraneous matter that gets extracted along with the mined coal or reducing the associated ash or both Two basic processes of beneficiation: Dry deshaling: Non coal or shaly coal is removed without using any liquid mediaCombustion of Coal NIT SrinagarPulverised coal combustion technology is mainly used for steam generation in the power plant,where most of the cases suspended coal bed is employed In combustion oxygen may be supplied by using fresh air or a stream rich in oxygen to ensure complete combustion Oxy fuel combustion is an example of a process where the second type of oxygen.
