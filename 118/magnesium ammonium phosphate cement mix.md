## Performance analysis of magnesium phosphate cement mortar.
Phosphate cements for commercial applications are generally based on reactions between a metallic oxide and an acid salt or derivative of phosphoric acid1.Immediately upon mixing the raw materials at ambient temperature,exothermic reactions occur and ammonium and magnesium phosphate phases are formed.Retardation and reaction mechanisms of magnesium phosphate2017104&ensp&#0183&enspMagnesium phosphate cement (MPC) is a new type of phosphate repair material with early strength and super rapid hardening ability.Compared with Portland cement,MPC has advantages such as rapid lowtemperature condensation,high bond strength,minimal dry shrinkage,and good abrasion and frost resistance.
