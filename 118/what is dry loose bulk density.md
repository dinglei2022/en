## Standard Test Method for Bulk Density (“Unit Weight”),
11 This test method covers the determination of bulk density (“unit weight”) of aggregate in a compacted or loose condition,and calculated voids between particles in fine,coarse,or mixed aggregates based on the same determination This test method is applicable to aggregates not exceeding 125 mm [5 in] in nominal maximum sizeBulk density WikipediaThe bulk density of soil depends greatly on the mineral make up of soil and the degree of compactionThe density of quartz is around 265 g cm³ but the (dry) bulk density of a mineral soil is normally about half that density,between 10 and 16 g cm³ Soils high in organics and some friable clay may have a bulk density well below 1 g cm³

## S.3.6.BULK DENSITY AND TAPPED DENSITY OF
S.3.6.BULK DENSITY AND TAPPED DENSITY OF POWDERS BULK DENSITY The bulk density of a powder is the ratio of the mass of an untapped powder sample and its volume including the contribution of the interparticulate void volume.Hence,the bulk density depends on both the density of powder particles and the spatial arrangement of particles in theSoil Moisture ContentDry Density Relationship201873&ensp&#0183&enspHence to obtain dry density,we need bulk density and moisture content of soil sample.How moisture content affects the dry density? Generally dry soil contains soil particles which are not in contact with each other and when we try to compact this type of soil without water tit becomes stiff and cracks and gaps will be formed.
