## Quartz as Aggregate in HMA CR4 Discussion Thread
2011815&ensp&#0183&enspHello everybody.Wich could be the dissavantage to use quartz (meaning sort silica) as aggregate in Hot MIx Asphalt.We are on the way to make some test,but some advice and advance would be helpfull.8 Things You Don't Know About Quartz CountertopsSure,in most quartz countertops there is some quartz in there,but saying that quartz countertops are all quartz is like saying that all cars in an average parking lot are Chevrolets.Fully 10 percent of the volume in a quartz countertop isn't stone at all,but rather a polymeric or cementbased binder.

## Study on adhesion between asphalt binders and aggregate
The performance of asphalt mixtures is highly dependent on the properties of binders,aggregates and their interfaces.The major distress of asphalt mixtures is cracking,that can occur either within asphalt binders,at the binder aggregate interfaces or within aggregate particles ().Recently,atomic force microscope (AFM) has been used to investigate the properties of asphalt materials.Papers by Keyword: Quartz scientific.netPartially replacement of aggregate by limestone fines has caused dramatic growth in strength,especially in mortars with high content of binder.The applied limestone aggregate is convenient to limebased mortars and the addition of limestone fines contributes to better mechanical properties of lime mortars.
