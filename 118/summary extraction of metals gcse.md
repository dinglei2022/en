2019717&ensp&#0183&enspSome metals are above carbon in the reactivity series,and therefore can not be extracted from their ores using carbon reduction methods.Despite Aluminium being the most abundant metal on earth,it is a relatively expensive material,owing to the fact that the extraction of aluminium from its ore,Bauxite,is a costly process.50.5 EXTRACTION OF METALS METALLURGY ChemistryThe highly electropositive elements such as alkali metals,alkaline earth metals and aluminium cannot be extracted by carbon reduction methods.They are extracted by the electrolysis of their fused salts.The process of extraction of metals by the use of electrolysis phenomenon is called electrometallurgy.
