## Briquetting an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The most appropriate water content in the raw material for briquetting varies and depends on the raw material.However,the normal water content is between 6% and 16%.If the water content is over 16% the quality of the briquettes will be reduced,or the process will not be possible.Maschinenfabrik K&#246ppern Der Spezialist f&#252rFines from Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) Fines ranging from 6 to 40% arise when iron ore is directly reduced.These fines are difficult to handle and to process in a melting vessel.Thus size enlargement is required.In the briquetting process,fines are usually bound using water glass with hydrated lime.
