## Recycling or disposing of Mill scale Finishing
Q.My company generates about 400 tonnes of mill scale from its hot rolling ( of steel) operation.This waste material is becoming on environmental problem due to.Mill Scale Uses and ApplicationsA.Mill scale is oxides of iron and alloying elements present in steel.Obviously,it is a rich source of iron.Most of the steel plants recycle mill scale through sintering or pelletization.However,a value added utilization of mill scale is in steel making after converting it into briquettes.

## 3 Iron Unit Recycling
3 Iron Unit Recycling On a weight basis,steel is the most recycled material in use today (Figure 3 1).The 70 million net tons of steel recycled in 2000 were used to produce about 112 million net tons of new steel in the United States.Recycling of steel plant mill scale via iron ore sintering.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The mill scale contains high amounts of Fe and low amounts of silica and alumina.Thus,recycling it through the sintering process helps in the saving of raw materials like iron ore and limestone.This paper presents preliminary findings of a study that investig
