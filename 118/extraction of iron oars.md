## THE EXTRACTION OF METALS AN INTRODUCTION
2019727&ensp&#0183&enspThis page looks at the various factors which influence the choice of method for extracting metals from their ores,including reduction by carbon,reduction by a reactive metal (like sodium or magnesium),and by electrolysis.Details for the extraction of aluminium,copper,iron and titanium areIron Ore: Sedimentary Rock Pictures,Definition & More18 08 2020&#0183;&#32;Earth's most important iron ore deposits are found in sedimentary rocks They formed from chemical reactions that combined iron and oxygen in marine and fresh waters The two most important minerals in these deposits are iron oxides: hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) These iron ores have been mined to produce almost every iron and.

## What are methods of extracting metals from ores?
The second is extraction by reaction with either carbon or carbon monoxide,which is used for less reactive metals like iron,lead and zinc.The third and final method is the use of hydrogen andExamples of Metal Ores Eduion Seattle PIBauxitetoaluminum refinement is a rather expensive process and,as aluminum has a low melting point and is easily recycled,much of the aluminum we use today has been recycled many times over.Iron is the fourthmost abundant element behind oxygen,silicon and aluminum,and the most common iron ore mined today is hematite.
