## Concrete Wikipedia
Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general usage.It is a basic ingredient of concrete,mortar and many plasters.British masonry worker Joseph Aspdin patented Portland cement in 1824.It was named because of the similarity of its color to Portland limestone,quarried from the English Isle of Portland and used extensively in London architecture.Cement &amp Concrete AppliionsCement &amp Concrete Basics.In its simplest form,concrete is a mixture of paste and aggregates.The paste,composed of portland cement and water,coats the surface of the fine and coarse aggregates.Through a chemical reaction called hydration,the paste hardens and gains strength to form the rocklike mass known as concrete.

## CONCRETE MIXING RATIOS WHAT IS THE BASIC MIXING RATIO
When making concrete it's important to use the correct concrete mixing ratios to produce a strong,durable concrete mix.To make concrete there are four basic materials you need: portland cement,sand,aggregate (stone),and water.Concrete Mix Design The Right The Concrete NetworkWith slabs,shrinkage is the number one concern and lower strength concrete (with less cement paste) will often shrink and curl less.With decorative concrete,surface hardeners will provide a higher strength,more wear resistant and less permeable surface layer,the overall concrete strength can be less.DESIGNING THE RIGHT CONCRETE MIX
