## Iron(III) chloride Wikipedia
2019720&ensp&#0183&enspIron(III) chloride is the inorganic compound with the formula (Fe Cl 3).Also called ferric chloride,it is an common compound of iron in the +3 oxidation state.The anhydrous compound is a crystalline solid with a melting point of 307.6 &#176C.The color depends on the viewing angle: by reflected light the crystals appear dark green,but by transmitted light they appear purplered.WebElements Periodic Table &#187 Iron &#187 reactions of elementsReaction of iron with water.Airfree water has little effect upon iron metal.However,iron metal reacts in moist air by oxidation to give a hydrated iron oxide.This does not protect the iron surface to further reaction since it flakes off,exposing more iron metal to oxidation.This process is called rusting and is familiar to any car owner.
