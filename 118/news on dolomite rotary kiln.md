Lime kiln is also named as lime rotary kiln and active lime kiln,which is the main equipment for calcining active lime.It is widely used in limestone,dolomite,kaolin,cement,special cement,bauxite,refractory material,powder,magnesium oxide,zinc oxide,titanium iron,[PDF] Energy optimisation of vertical shaft kiln operation,The essential part of the refractory materials production on a basis of sintered dolomite as raw material is the process of dolomite calcination The technology process usually takes place in shaft or rotary kilns,where the dolomite stone,CaMg(CO3)2,is subjected to a high temperature heat treatment The calcination of the dolomite is highly endothermic reaction,requiring significant amount.

## Dolomite Refractory Products In Cement Industry
Why Dolomite? There are a number of unique properties in dolomite brick that make dolomite well suited for use as a refractory lining in a cement rotary kiln A high degree of refractoriness allows the dolomite brick to withstand the temperatures and stresses involved in the burning zone,the corrosion resistance to alkalis and a reducing.Dolomite Its Processing and Appliion in Iron andJun 28,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32Several different types of kilns are used for the calcination process.These kilns can be rotary kilns or shaft kilns.The type of the kiln to be selected strongly depend on the characteristics of the raw dolomite,anticipated production rate,cost of fuel,investment costs,available fuel,local conditions,infrastructure and other things.
