Hydrated lime should dry slowly over a period of days,and then it will benefit from numerous wetting and drying cycles in the following weeks,because it requires a combination of both moisture and carbon dioxide from the air in order to cure.Although it's rare,overzealous wetting of lime plaster such that it never dries out in the first few weeks can slow carbonation and be harmful.Lime and Gypsum Suppliers SAKG201956&ensp&#0183&enspSAKG is a supplier of agricultural and industrial lime and gypsum products as well as a the supplier of the Prolime Feed Lime range.
