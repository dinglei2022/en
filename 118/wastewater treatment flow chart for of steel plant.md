## Wastewater treatment Primary treatment Britannica
Wastewater treatment Wastewater treatment Primary treatment: Primary treatment removes material that will either float or readily settle out by gravity.It includes the physical processes of screening,comminution,grit removal,and sedimentation.Screens are made of long,closely spaced,narrow metal bars.They block floating debris such as wood,rags,and other bulky objects that couldProcess water quality requirements for iron and steel makingAn overall flow pattern of the steelmaking process is shown in Fig 3(2) WATER SYSTEM IN AN INTEGRATED STEEL PLANT While Fig 3 shows the complex pattern of material flow in a steel plant,the water system to accomplish efficient operation is far more complex,as shown in Fig 4v&#176;) in Figa 4 the fin ishing units of sheet and tin mill and.
