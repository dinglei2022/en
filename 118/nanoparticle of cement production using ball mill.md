## enhancing the usage of fly ash in cement and concrete through
ash can be transformed into property enhancer to cement through mechanical process to enhance the use of fly ash.For last two decades classification of fly ash through.ash having lime reactivity in the range of 7 to 12Mpa can be added 35% to OPC to produce Portland.In ball mill particle size reduction is by attrition.NanoparticlesThe mechanical production approach uses milling to crush microparticles.This approach is applied in producing metallic and ceramic nanomaterials.For metallic nanoparticles,for example,traditional source materials (such as metal oxides) are pulverized using high energy ball mills.
