## What is Hydrogen Sulfide and Why is it a Lethal Hazard
Like hydrogen sulfide,oil and gas are also created by the breakdown of organic materials,and as such,the two are often found together.As a result,hydrogen sulfide can be present at sites during extraction of natural resources.The refinement of petroleum can also produce hydrogen sulfide when hydrogen is used to remove sulfur from petroleum.What Is Hydrogen Sulfide? PK Safety SupplyHydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a deadly gas common at many industrial work sites.It must be handled carefully because its toxicity is similar to cyanide,and even slight exposure comes with a host of health concerns.Where does it come from? H2S has few industrial appliions on its own,but can be used to harvest sulfur,one of the most useful and versatile elements in the industry.

## Reduction of hydrogen sulfide gas in a small wastewater
Hydrogen sulfide generated by SRB diffuses from the biofilm into the wastewater,where it dissociates into bisulfide (HS −) and sulfide (S 2−).The relative distribution of these sulfur species is pH dependent,as dictated by Equations 1 and 2.Buy Hydrogen Sulfide Gas Cylinders & Tanks Praxair,Inc.Supply & Service.We offer hydrogen sulfide in a variety of purities and concentrations.See the.Hydrogen Sulfide Nitrogen Mixture,0.5 ppm 10% Nitrogen.
