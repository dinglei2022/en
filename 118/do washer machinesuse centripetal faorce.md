## What is a centripetal force? (article) Khan Academy
A centripetal force is a net force that acts on an object to keep it moving along a circular path In our article on centripetal acceleration,we learned that any object traveling along a circular path of radius with velocity experiences an acceleration directed toward the center of its path,How is Centripetal force applied on the functioning ofDec 15,2007&nbsp&#0183&#32Centripetal force is the force which keeps any object in circular motion.In washing machine,whenever the clothes are in circular motion the drums provide the necessary centripetal force to keep them in circular motion.In the drums there are holes and the holes cannot provide the centripetal force.
