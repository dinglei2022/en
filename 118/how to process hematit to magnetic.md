## Hematite Gemstone Information GemSelect
It is harder than pure iron,with a hardness ranging from 5.50 to 6.50 on the Mohs scale,which is similar to opal or turquoise.Hematite is often confused with 'hematine',a magnetic imitation form of hematite.Natural hematite is not usually magnetic,but it can be magnetized by a process of heating and cooling while attached to a strong magnet.How do you polish Hematite answersHematite is used in rouge makeup and polish because of its red pigment (remember,it has a red to redbrown streak!) Also it is used for ore of iron for steel tools,vehicles,nails and bolts and

## How to make hematite magnetic? Physics Stack Exchange
Hematite has certain magnetic qualities,such as being paramagnetic (meaning it is attracted to magnetic fields),but I have read that if you heat it up it becomes strongly magnetic.But I have a string of magnetic hematite beads.If they are magnetic,does that mean someone has heated them? Or is hematite only magnetic while it is hot? How doHematite WikipediaHematite,also spelled as haematite,is a common iron oxide with the formula Fe 2 O 3 and is widespread in rocks and soils.Hematite crystallizes in the rhombohedral lattice system,and it has the same crystal structure as ilmenite and corundum.Hematite and ilmenite form a complete solid solution at temperatures above 950 &#176C (1,740 &#176F).
