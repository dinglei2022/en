## Use of Steel Slag Aggregate in Pavements Report November.
Steel slag aggregate (SSA) is a byproduct of the production of steel in an electric arc furnace.The high iron oxide content of the aggregate results in an aggregate that is very hard and very dense (SSA is 20 30% heavier than naturally occurring aggregates such as basalt and granite).Concrete aggregate : Iron and steel slag products : NIPPON.Iron and steel slag aggregate is an industrial product that is manufactured under extensive quality management,and contains no organic impurities,clay,shells,or similar materials.
