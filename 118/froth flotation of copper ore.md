## Copper activation option for a pentlandite pyrrhotite
Introduction.Different sulphide ores respond differently in the prospect of copper activation to thiols for froth flotation.With the BCL SelebiPhikwe ore body,pentlandite pyrrhotite chalcopyrite cooccur and there is the constraint of fine pentlandite dissemination in the pyrrhotite,so that liberation is limited.Copper extraction Wikipedia2019622&ensp&#0183&enspCopper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes.Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source,local environmental regulations,and other factors.As in all mining operations,the ore must usually be
