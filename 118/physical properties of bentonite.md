## Use of Bentonite Slurry in Pile Foundation Cast in situ
Bentonite is the name used for a range of clays that can swell and gel when mixed with water.Bentonite is naturally found in form of sodium montmorillonite which exhibits thixotropic properties i.e.when bentonite is mixed with water it form a gel under static conditions but when disturbed or when distressed it regains its fluidity.Bentonite WikipediaBentonite ( ˈbɛntənʌɪt ) is an absorbent aluminium phyllosilicate clay consisting mostly of montmorillonite.It was named by Wilbur C.Knight in 1898 after the …
