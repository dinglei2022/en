The solution also optimizes pull rates and air flow rates of individual cells across the flotation bank to maximize recovery at the required production rate.Typical flotation bank design assumes an optimal profile of froth pull rates,where the optimal pull rate in the first cell can be 36 times that of the final cell in the same bank.A MILP model for design of flotation circuits with bank2019730&ensp&#0183&enspA MILP model for design of flotation circuits with bank column and regrind no regrind selection @inproceedings{Cisternas2006AMM,title={A MILP model for design of flotation circuits with bank column and regrind no regrind selection},author={Luis A.Cisternas and David A.M{'e}ndez and Edelmira D.G{'a}lvez and Rodrigo E.Jorquera},year={2006} }

## An Overview of Optimizing Strategies for Flotation Banks
All these stages comprise serial arrangements of flotation cells known as banks,lines or rows.Although a bank is the simplest interconnection of cells in a circuit,i.e.the tails of one cell is the feed to the next cell down the bank,how to operate each flotation cell in a way that the whole bank performance is optimized remains a challenge.1 Froth Flotation Fundamental Principles2009827&ensp&#0183&enspFroth flotation is a good example of an engineering "system",in that the various important parameters are highly interrelated,as shown in Figure 1.It is therefore important to take all of Chemistry Components Collectors Frothers Activators Depressants pH Equipment Components Cell Design Agitation Air Flow Cell Bank Configuration
