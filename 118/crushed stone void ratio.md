## Crushed Stone: Roadway Materials &amp; Pricing Guide
Crushed stone and road construction go hand in hand.Whether you’re planning on building a road that’s surfaced with loose gravel,are looking for a semi permanent option like crushed asphalt,or simply need a heavy and reliable stone base for your concrete or asphalt roadway,there’s simply no getting around the fact that you’re going to need to work with a reliable stone aggregate.Void Ratio for Common Gravel & Sand SciencingGravel typically has a void ratio about 0.4,regardless of whether it is well or poorly graded,although the void ratio can be affected by the presence of impurities,such as clay or silt.Gravel with clay has a void ratio of about 0.25,while gravel with silt can have a void ratio of 0.2 or less.
