Abstract.C a (g min cm 2),the maximum solids concentrate rate or carrying capacity in column flotation,is expressed as the mass of solids from the overflow per unit of column cross sectional area.It can be measured for a given set of operating conditions by determining concentrate solids rate as a function of feed solids rate.Carrying capacity is expected to depend on particular variablesDEMINERALIZATION OF ZONGULDAK HARD COAL BYZonguldak hard coal to be used in the preparation of coalwater fuels.Flotation and leaching techniques were used to achieve this goal.At the end of the studies,a clean coal concentrate containing 1.18% of ash and 0.53 % of sulfur with 8188 kcal kg calorific value was obtained from 14.43% of ash hard coal.Keywords: coal,flotation,leaching
