The migration of these solute elements strongly influences the effects of radiation upon the materials,and our results suggest that the low rotation energy barrier leading to threedimensional migration is a property that is key to the explanation of the radiation effects experimentally observed in tungstenrhenium and tungstenosmium alloys.Photoinduced Intramolecular Electron Transfer in Ruthenium2018426&ensp&#0183&enspRu(II) and Os(II) complexes (P) of [4'(pphenyl)]terpyridyl ligand (ptpy) derivatized with an electron acceptor (A) of the triphenylpyridinium (H3TP+) type have been recently proposed as functional models for electrontransfer (ET) processes in the context of artificial photosynthesis.These inorganic dyads,P−A,are expected to undergo intramolecular photoinduced ET to form a charge
