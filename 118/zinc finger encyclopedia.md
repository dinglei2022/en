Abstract.The "zinc finger" is a 30residue repeating motif that has been identified in a variety of eukaryotic transcription factors.Each domain is capable of binding a Zn 2+ ion through invariant Cys and His residues.We have determined the threedimensional structure of a synthetic peptide that corresponds to one of the two zinc finger domains in the yeast transcription factor ADR1ZFN,TALEN,and CRISPR Casbased methods for genomeThe Cys 2 His 2 zincfinger domain is among the most common types of DNAbinding motifs found in eukaryotes and represents the second most frequently encoded protein domain in the human genome.An individual zincfinger consists of approximately 30 amino acids in a conserved ββα configuration (Figure 1A).Several amino acids on the surface of the αhelix typically contact 3 bp in the

Zinc fingers are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds.They can be classified into several different structural families and typically function as interaction modules that bind DNA,RNA,proteins or small molecules.The name &quotzinc finger&quot was originally coined to describe the hypothesized structure of the repeated unit inZinc finger protein 804A — Wikipedia Republished WIKI 22019618&ensp&#0183&enspZinc finger protein 804A is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ZNF804A gene.The human gene maps to chromosome 2 q32.1 and consists of 4 exons that code for a protein of 1210 amino acids (137 kDa).Little is known about the characteristics and function of the encoded protein.
