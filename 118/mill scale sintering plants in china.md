Mill scale is suitable for direct recycling to the blast furnace via sintering plant [4].Approximately,90% of mill scale is directly recycled within steelmaking industry and small amounts are used for ferroalloys,in cement plants and in the petrochemicals industry [5 8].What exactly is Mill Scale and what is done about itThis is not very neighborly,to say the least,so a few companies have come up with alternatives.One is to compress the mill scale into giving up the oils and lubricants and water to an acceptable level for the feed to the sinter plant where the mill scale is mixed with other iron ores and hydrocarbons from coke plants and bake it at 2500 °F.

## Sinter plant Wikipedia
Sinter plants agglomerate iron ore fines (dust) with other fine materials at high temperature,to create a product that can be used in a blast furnaceThe final product,a sinter,is a small,irregular nodule of iron mixed with small amounts of other minerals The process,called sintering,causes the constituent materials to fuse to make a single,Sinter PlantSMS scale &amp; mill scale etc.alongwith flue dust in future.After completion of the sintering process,sinter cake will be crushed and screened after discharge from the machine.Sinter having size &gt; 5 mm will go to the cooler and then.Sinter plant is the best

## Bulk cargo Mill scale
Though it is regarded as a waste product,mill scale is recycled as a ferrous feed for iron sinter plants,which are plants very much associated with the manufacture of iron and steel.Therefore,mill scale is reused as a raw material for the manufacture of iron and because of this,it is increasingly tradeControl of Pollution in the Iron and Steel IndustryThe sintering converts fine sized raw material,iron ore,coke breeze,limestone,mill scale,and flue dust into an agglomerated product (sinter) at suitable size for charging into the blast furnace.T
