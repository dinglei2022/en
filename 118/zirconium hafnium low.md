## Zirconium Metal &amp; Alloy Supplier Composition.
Zirconium has a low modulus of elasticity; therefore,residual stresses are low in a finished weld.However,stress relief of these welds has been found to be beneficial.A stress relief temperature of 550&#176; (1020&#176;F) should be used for hafnium.Zirconium is subject to severe embrittlement by relatively minute amounts of impurities,especially.US20050214458A1This invention relates to hafnium halide compositions having a zirconium concentration of less than about 1000 parts per million,a process for producing the hafnium halide compositions having a zirconium concentration of less than about 1000 parts per million.

## Zirconium and hafnium USGS
Zirconium and hafnium are likely not essential to human health and generally are considered to be of low toxicity to humans.The main exposure risks are associated with industrial inhalation and dermal exposure.Because of the low solubility of zirconium and hafnium,ecological health concerns in the aquatic environment and in soils are minimal.hafnium (Hf) chemical element Britannicait is essential that the zirconium be essentially free of hafnium,because the usefulness of zirconium in reactors is based on its extremely low.
