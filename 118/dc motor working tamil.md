## What is the Main Difference Between AC and DC Motor?
In BLDC (Brushless DC) motor,the stator is made of multiple coils that surround the rotor armature made of permanent magnetsThe DC is changed into 3 phase AC using thyristors & supplied to the stator coils to generate a rotating magnetic field In such motors,the input is applied to the stationary part thus it does not require brushes or commutatorServomotor Wikipedia2019729&ensp&#0183&enspA servomotor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position,velocity and acceleration.It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback.It also requires a relatively sophistied controller,often a dedied module designed specifically for use with servomotors.

DC Motors The types of dc motors mainly include Series,Shunt,and Compound wound & PMDC Motor dc motor 1) DC Shunt Motor DC shunt motor works on DC and the windings of this electric motor like the armature windings and field windings are linked in parallel which is known as a shunt This kind of motor is also called as shunt wound DC.DC Inverter Air Conditioner Working PrinciplesDC Brushless Motor.In a DC brushless motor used in the DC inverter air conditioner or heatpump,the rotor of the motor is constructed using permanent magnets with windings on the stator.There are no brushes and commutator compared to typical DC motor hence eliminating concerns such as sparks,brush life,brush residue and electrical noise.
