## Individual Dust Collectors Versus a Centralized System
Individual Dust Collectors Versus a Centralized System I am about to add a CNC router to the shop and am wondering if it makes sense to hook everything up to one big unit.We would add a machine and add a point of use dust collector (cheap Delta units to 10hp Dustiks units),turning them on when we were running that machine.We are inArduino CNC : 8 Steps (with Pictures) InstructablesThe cnc is made of wood thanks to the help of my father It has taken us many hours to do the mechanical part however the electronic part is faster to do,but is very gratifying I based my project on these videos and I have received much support from the author of the first video
