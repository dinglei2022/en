## Modify Railing Height and Slope Revit Products,
Control the height and slope of individual rail sketch lin For example,on a set of U shaped stairs,you may want to set the inner railing to a different height than the outer railing With slope adjustment,you can control how the railing segment follows the slope of the stairs You may want the segment to be flat at some points or sloped at other pointsBuilding a spiral ramp with angle gradient restrictions,Dear support team For a museum project we are designing a spiral ramp that needs to fulfil building laws concerning the slope gradient Is there an elegant way to display the angle or the gradient,
