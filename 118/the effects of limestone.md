## Limestone and Acid Rain
Effect of Limestone.Calcium carbonate,[Ca][CO3] is a very common mineral.Limestone is one familiar form of calcium carbonate.Acids in acid rain promote the dissolution of calcium carbonate by reacting with the carbonate anion.What happens when acid reacts with limestone? Science.Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3).This is not very soluble,so rocks don't dissolve very quickly.But if you add an acid,you add hydrogen ions (H+),which will react with the carbonate to form hydrogen carbonate HCO3 ions,which are very soluble in water,and the limestone will dissolve.
