International Gem SocietyInternal cleavage planes are,therefore,as symmetrical as external crystal faces.The term cleavage in gemology only applies to crystalline materials.For example,since glass is a supercooled liquid in which the atoms are not arranged in a longrange periodic array,it can have no cleavage because there are no uniform bond layers.

## Garnet RockForming Minerals
Garnet is a dense and hard silie mineral which occurs in many rock types,but it is especially common in some metamorphic rocks like schist and amphibolite.It is a common rockforming mineral in some igneous rocks.Crystals are usually reddish and isometric.Cleavage (crystal) Wikipedia2019731&ensp&#0183&enspCleavage,in mineralogy,is the tendency of crystalline materials to split along definite crystallographic structural planes.These planes of relative weakness are a result of the regular loions of atoms and ions in the crystal,which create smooth repeating surfaces that are visible both in the microscope and to the naked eye.[1]

Garnet is not a single mineral,but a group contains closely related,isomorphous minerals that form a series with each other.The Garnet members form intermediary minerals between each member,and may even intergrow within a single crystal.The Garnets vary only slightly in physical properties,and some of the members may be so similar that they are indistinguishable from one another withoutGemstone Cleavage Chart Gemstone Information2019731&ensp&#0183&enspGemstone Cleavage Chart.One of the characteristics of crystals is that they have cleavage.Cleavage is the tendency of a crystal to break cleanly along distinct planes.Since most gemstones are crystals,cleavage is an issue that gem buyers as well as jewelers and gem cutters need to

## 2.6 Mineral Properties Physical Geology opentextbc.ca
Cleavage is what we see when a mineral breaks along a specific plane or planes,while fracture is an irregular break.Some minerals tend to cleave along planes at various fixed orientations,some do not cleave at all (they only fracture).Minerals that have cleavage can also fracture along surfaces that are not parallel to their cleavage planes.
