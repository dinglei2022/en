Evidence of what is believed to be the first example of iron mining and smelting points to the ancient Hittite culture in what is now Turkey.Because iron was a far superior material for the manufacture of weapons and tools than any other known metal,its production was a closely guarded secret.Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper OresCopper processing is a complied process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called hodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different
