## Important Facts About the Popular Igneous Rock
Basalt (extrusive rock) and granite (intrusive rock) are two of the most common igneous rock types on the Earth,and cover most of the igneous deposits on the planet.Usually,the rocks in deep ocean floors are known to be basaltic in nature,while the rocks in the continental mass are granitic in nature.Granite rocksandminerals4uGranite is the most common intrusive plutonic igneous rock.Intrusive means that it has moved into other rocks by force coming up from the mantle.Plutonic means that it is magma that does not reach the surface of the earth and so cools very slowly underground.
