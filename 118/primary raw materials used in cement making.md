## Composition of cement Penn State Engineering
This is a fluxing agent which reduces the melting temperature of the raw materials in the kiln (from 3,000 o F to 2,600 o F).It hydrates rapidly,but does not contribute much to strength of the cement paste.By mixing these compounds appropriately,manufacturers can produce different types of cement to suit several construction environments.primary raw materials used in cement making …Production Ciment Qu&#233;bec.Limestone and other raw materials used in producing cement are extracted.At Ciment Qu&#233;bec inc.the main quarry is adjacent to the.

## Raw materials Understanding Cement
If the 'good stuff' is all used up first,it may be more difficult to make cement out of what is left.Careful selection on a daytoday basis is needed to make the best use of all the materials available.Raw materials are extracted from the quarry,then crushed and ground as necessary to provide a fine material for blending.
