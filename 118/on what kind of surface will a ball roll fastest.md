## How Does The Type Of Surface Affect The Distance A Toy
Answer (1 of 4): The type of surface is defined as smooth or rough generally.The smooth surface has little less friction while the rough surface has greater friction.No surface is without friction.When the wheels of the toy car rotate on the surface there is an opposing force acting between the wheels and the surface called frictional force.The Effect of Surface Texture Science Fair Science,Rolling friction is affected by the texture of both the surface and the rolling object Had I used a tennis ball it probably would have rolled a shorter distance because of the ball’s texture Rolling friction is also affected by how large the contact area is between the object and the surface If my marble was shaped into a cylinder there.
