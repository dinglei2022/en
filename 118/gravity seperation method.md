By flowing the powdered ore in a current of water,the lighter rocky impurities can be washed away and the ore particles are left behind.For this,either wilfley table or Hydraulic classifier is used.Generally oxide and carbonate ores are concentrated by this method.i.e.haematite and cerussite.There are two gravity concentration methods.concentration of the ore gravity separationGravity Separation Separation of gravity: Gravity separation is a mineral separation process based on the density difference between particles and particles of ore impurities.Froth Flotation Separation flotation: Froth flotation is a separation process ore from mineral impurities by way of float ore to the surface through binding to the froth.
