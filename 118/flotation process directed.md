## Primary process in competitive archery performance
199854&ensp&#0183&enspAbstract The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether or nor the floating form of Restricted Environmental Stimulation Technique (REST) may be exploited within the field of competitive archery to reinforce primary process (innerdirected) orientation and thereby enhance the quality of coaching and training.Floatation REST consists of a procedure whereby an individual is:: Selecting Flotation Cells: How Many and mineng2018424&ensp&#0183&enspThese large cells can also create a trap in situations where the throughput rate is high and the grade is also high.In this situation,it is possible to have too little froth area,making froth removal the ratecontrolling step in the flotation process.
