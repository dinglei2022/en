## Forges and Furnaces Collection
Refinery forges needed furnaces to supply their pig iron and to a lesser extent,furnaces needed forges to which to send their pig iron These dependencies led to a number of furnace forge relationships and particularly in the case of earlier ironworks,a furnace and a forge were often thought of as a package when sold or rentedAgglomeration Iron & Steel Kuettner GroupAn agglomeration process which does not require heating of the material and thus is emission free is the production of cement bound stones in a vibrating press This method is particularly suitable for feedstocks circulatory substances that emit pollutants when heated This agglomeration process developed by Küttner for the shaft furnace.

## Iron Ore Agglomeration Processes and their Historical
2019722&ensp&#0183&enspIron Ore Agglomeration Processes and their Historical Development.There are four types of agglomerating processes which have been developed (Fig 1).They are (i) briquetting,(ii) nodulizing,(iii) sintering,and (iv) pelletizing.Fig 1 Agglomeration processes.Briquetting istreatment of iron ore agglomeration oerknagersUS3053647A Agglomeration of iron ores Google Patents (Cl.753) This invention relates to improvements in ore agglomeration,and particularly to the agglomeration of iron ores into pellet form.The use of fine.iron ores and fine iron concentrate as blast furnace charging material in the form of hardened pellets is increasingly constantly.
