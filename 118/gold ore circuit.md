Ore processing is a 24 hour operation.Ore is stockpiled (1) at the processing plant,and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader.The ore is conveyed,and lime is added (2) to raise the pH of the ore.Valves for gold production with CIL,CIP or CIC circuitsIn the CIL circuit,cyanide and oxygen are added to the slurry,resulting in gold being dissolved from the ore.Activated carbon is then fed into the process from the opposite direction,against the slurry stream,and as it moves through the CIL tanks,dissolved gold adsorbs onto the activated carbon.
