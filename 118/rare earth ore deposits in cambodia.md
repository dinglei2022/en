## Rare Earths Update Thermo Fisher Scientific
26 May 2016.Several years ago we discussed how rare earth elements (REEs) are not very rare at all.Although originally thought to be rare,many of the minerals are actually common in the Earth&#39;s crust.However,they rarely exist in pure form and are usually found within other minerals,making them costly to mine.Rare Earth Element Mines,Deposits,and OccurrencesRare Earth Element Mines,Deposits,and Occurrences Metadata also available as  [Parseable text] Frequently anticipated questions: What does this data set describe?
