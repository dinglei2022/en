## 2 Wastewater Treatment by using Natural Coagulant
The quality of the wastewater treated by using natural coagulant is comparable to the quality of the wastewater treated by commercial coagulant and hence can be used to replace aluminium sulphate as commercial coagulant The highest removal efficiency of roselle seeds was within 812 to 9313% for synthetic wastewater at pH 4Paint Standards and Related Coating Standards astmASTM's paint and related coating standards are instrumental in specifying and evaluating the physical and chemical properties of various paints and coatings that are applied to certain bulk materials to improve their surface properties.
