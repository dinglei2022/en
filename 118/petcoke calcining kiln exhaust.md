As petcoke has a higher energy content,petcoke emits between 30 and 80 percent more CO 2 than coal per unit of weightThe differences between Coal and Coke in CO 2 production per unit energy produced are small and depend upon the moisture in the coal (increases the CO 2 per unit energy Heat of combustion) and volatile hydrocarbon in coal and coke (decrease the CO 2 per unit energy)Technology Options for the Cement Industry with the Use2007518&ensp&#0183&enspTechnology Options for the Cement Industry with the Use of Alternative Fuels.Kiln burner Calcining zone Transition and Sintering zone High precalcination rate of hot meal (&gt 90%) Fuel energy in the calciner (up to 60 %) is used for Specific exhaust gas amount Specific heat demand
