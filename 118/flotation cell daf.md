> DAF Technology.DISSOLVED AIR FLOTATION.Wastewater is generated in each industry and each has unique treatment approaches.Before implementation of best technology for the treatment,considerable study must be done.Detailed potential scenarios for the treatment must be applied in order to minimize the cost for the treatment.DAF systems are.Froth flotation WikipediaFroth flotation is a process for separating minerals from gangue by taking advantage of differences in their hydrophobicity.Hydrophobicity differences between valuable minerals and waste gangue are increased through the use of surfactants and wetting agents.
