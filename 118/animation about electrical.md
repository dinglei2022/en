## Animation: U.S.Electric Vehicle Sales (20102019)
Jun 04,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Today's animation uses data from InsideEVs to show almost nine years of U.S.sales in the electric vehicle market,sorted by model of car.It paints a picture of a rapidly evolving market with many new competitors sweeping in to try and claim a stake.Induction motor WikipediaAn induction motor or asynchronous motor is an AC electric motor in which the electric current in the rotor needed to produce torque is obtained by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding.An induction motor can therefore be made without electrical connections to the rotor.An induction motor's rotor can be either wound type or squirrelcage type.

## What is Electrical Energy? Definition &amp Examples Video
What Is Electrical Energy? Energy is the ability to do work,where work is done when a force moves an object.We need and we use energy every day,and energy is available in all different forms.Introduction to Electricity video for kids YouTubeMay 06,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32Electricity is a type of energy that can build up in one place or flow from one place to another place.There are two types of Electricity,Static Electricity and Current Electricity.This video

## Animations showing voltage,current,voltmeters and ammeters
Lesson 5: Voltage and Current Introduction.The idea of electrical potential energy (or potential for short) is quite strictly defined but for most of the time we can say that voltage and potential mean the same thing.Potential difference,or p.d.is just the same as voltage difference.The animation shows that the charges are movingElectrical TrainingEach Module contains a Dvd narrated by Tom Henry with actual footage of electrical installations,animation of electrons,voltamps,etc.Each Dvd is approximately 75120 minutes in length.If you're a contractor that has untrained electricians,this will be an excellent opportunity to improve the quality and production of your work.Now you

## About the Electric Field of an Oscillating Charge Animation
About the Electric Field of an Oscillating Charge Animation.This animation visualises an oscillating electric charge and the electric field lines caused by it.The charge is executing simple harmonic motion in the vertical direction,with the maximum amplitude of the oscillation varying from zero to a maximum value and then back to zero.How do electric motors work? Explain that StuffElectric motors have proved themselves to be among the greatest inventions of all time.Let's pull some apart and find out how they work! Photo: Even small electric motors are surprisingly heavy.That's because they're packed with tightly wound copper and heavy magnets.This is the motor from an old electric lawn mower.
