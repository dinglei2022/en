## POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF ORE PRECONCENTRATION
POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF ORE PRECONCENTRATION USING HIGH VOLTAGE PULSES FOR AG SAG MILLING ABSTRACT A novel technique using high voltage pulses (HVP) for ore preconcentration has recently been reported.The technique utilises metalliferous graininduced selective breakage and sizebased screening to separate the feed ore by grade.Gravity Concentration GekkoGravity concentration is the separation of minerals based on differences in specific gravity.A gravity concentration process is designed to recover very high grades of valuable ore material into very small masses.The resurgence of gravity concentration in mining has come about due to its simplicity and low environmental impact.

## Gold extraction Wikipedia
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing,resulting in direct recovery ofCopper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper OresCopper processing is a complied process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called hodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different
