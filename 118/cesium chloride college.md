## Largescale synthesis of ultrathin cesium lead bromide
As a promising material for optoelectronic devices,cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals have attracted wide attention recently.However,the fast anion exchange among CsPbX 3 is a problem for appliions (e.g.light emitting diode,LED) that require different colors.In this work,we report the largescale synthesis of ultrathin cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr 3) nanoplates (NPs) ofCesium chloride and high Ph therapy for cancerMar 08,2021&#0183;&#32;Cesium chloride absorption is higher by cancerous cells than normal cells The high concentration of this compound in cancer cells changes the Ph environment from a low Ph value or an acidic state to a high Ph state or an alkaline environment Cancer cells do not function normally in an alkaline environment
