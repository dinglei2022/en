## Appliion of SCC (Self Compacting Concrete) on the
201825&ensp&#0183&enspAbstract: SCC (Self Compacting Concrete) is a selfcompacting concrete with a high enough slump.SCC has a high flowability so that it can flow,meet the formwork and solidify by itself.Structural failures that generally occur in the joint of beamcolumn occur due to weak shear resistance and low ductility.The difficulty of mixingBehavior of Different SelfCompacted ConcreteSelfcompacting concrete The effect of materials used improved the selfcompacted reinforced concrete column and its behavior with many loading types.
