## Beryllium Copper (BeCu)
201911&ensp&#0183&enspBeryllium copper has high corrosion resistance and exceedingly good biofouling resistance,though its manufacturing is limited these days due to potential health effects of beryllium fume and powder inhalation during manufacturing.Nevertheless,in its age hardened condition,beryllium copper attains the highest strength and hardness of any commercial copperbased alloy.Difference Between Beryllium and AluminiumDec 10,2015&nbsp&#0183&#32Key Difference Beryllium vs Aluminium Beryllium and Aluminium are two metallic elements in two different periods and groups of the periodic table.The key difference between Beryllium and Aluminium is that Beryllium is a molecule in the group II (atomic number = 4) whereas Aluminium is a group XIII element (atomic number = 13).
