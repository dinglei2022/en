## Processes and Procedures in the Extraction of Iron.
The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process.The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace.These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.GCSE CHEMISTRY27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Extraction of Metals.Extraction of Iron.Iron is extracted from its ore in the blast furnace.The main iron ore is called haematite.Haematite is iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3.The iron ore contains impurities,mainly silica (silicon dioxide).Limestone (calcium carbonate) is added to the iron ore which reacts with the silica to form molten calcium silicate in the blast furnace.
