## Phosphate Ore Mining Process Equipment and Technology
Phosphate ore is mainly used in the fertilizer industry,and also can be used in an airline,food,medical and national defense.Nowadays,we have an increased demand for phosphate,and with the exploration of the phosphaterich ore,there is less rich ore and more poor ore,it pushes the research and development of mining equipment and technology.Phosphate mining in the United States WikipediaIn 2015,27.6 million metric tons of marketable phosphate rock,or phosphorite,was mined in the United States,making the US the world's thirdlargest producer,after China and Morocco.The phosphate mining industry employed 2,200 people.The value of phosphate rock mined was US$2.2 billion.

Mining chemicals represent a niche area of supply but at the same time their use is almost universal across the industry.In this month's immining Spotlight Feature Article,from the June issue of International Mining magazine,Editor Paul Moore looks atHow phosphate is mined and processedprevious paragraph overly simplifies a complied process that is not yet fully understood,in spite of being studied for more than one hundred years! How phosphate is mined and processes Mining Sedimentary phosphate tends to be found in loose sediment,so it can be mined with dredge lines (or picks and shovels).
