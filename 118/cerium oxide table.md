## Chemical Database: Cerium oxide
Editor's note: Some chemicals in this database contain more information than others due to the original reason this information was collected and how the compilation was accomplished.While working with material safety data sheets (MSDS),I found that manufacturers sometimes used obscure names for constituent chemicals and I didn't always have a good idea of what I was dealing with.Synthesis of stable cerium zirconium oxide nanoparticleThe elemental composition of the synthesized cerium zirconium mixed oxide nanoparticles was confirmed by Energy dispersive spectrum as shown in Fig.2.Table in Fig.2 gives the detailed elemental composition data.Fig.3 shows the Transmission electron microscope images along with diffraction pattern of cerium zirconium mixed oxide nanoparticles.TEM images show a size range of 15 20 nm.

## Cerium Elements Eduion in Chemistry
Cerium oxide.Today cerium comes from rare earth ores,and cerium oxide,CeO 2,is the most important outlet for cerium.It remains behind when the other metals are dissolved out using hydrochloric acid.The insoluble residue is known as cerium concentrate and current production is about 63 000 tonnes a year.Cerium Element information,properties and usesCerium(Ill) oxide has uses as a alyst.It is used in the inside walls of selfcleaning ovens to prevent the buildup of cooking residues.It is also used in alytic converters.Cerium(III) oxide nanoparticles are being studied as an additive for diesel fuel to help it burn more completely and reduce exhaust emissions.
