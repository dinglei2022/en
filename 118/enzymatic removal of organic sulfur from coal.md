## An evaluation of desulfurization technologies for sulfur
The current industrial method for removal of sulfur from fuels is hydrodesulfurization (HDS),which is a high temperature,high pressure alytic process.This makes HDS a very costly option for deep desulfurization.Moreover,HDS is not effective for removing heterocyclic sulfur compounds such as dibenzothiophene (DBT) and its derivatives,especially 4,6dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6DMDBT).Evaluating Advanced Power Plant Carbon Capture20141119&ensp&#0183&enspEvaluating Advanced Power Plant Carbon Capture Technologies Edward S.Rubin Sulfur Removal Combined Cycle Power Plant O 2 Air CO 2 Quench H 2 System H 2 H 2O Air Sulfur Recovery Gasifier Coal H 2O Metal organic frameworks Enzymatic membranes Present Cost Reduction Benefit 5+ years 10+ years 15+ years 20+ years
