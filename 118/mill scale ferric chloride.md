Iron(III) chloride,also called ferric chloride,is an industrial scale commodity chemical compound,with the formula FeCl3 The colour of iron(III) chloride crystals depends on the viewing angle: by reflected light the crystals appear dark green,but by transmitted light they appear purple redCOREThe ferric chloride solution produced from mill scale was characterized and applied in the sewage treatment of a university campus.As a result,a good condition for the dissolution of mill scale was with the use of 90% HCl solution,reaction time of 2 hours,at a temperature of 80&#186C.
