## What is the maximum cement quantity for m25 grade concrete,
04 11 2020&#0183;&#32;Answer by Mihir Salanke: Mix proportion for M25 grade of concrete is 1:1:2(cement:fine aggregates:coarse aggregates) So if you need 4cum of M25 concrete,we need to have 1cum of cement So,theoretically,for 1cum of M25 concrete,we need to have 025cum of cement But in practice,whenever we estimate quantity of cement for concrete,Strength behaviour of M25 and M45 concrete incorporating,Addition of CN and TEA increased the cost of concrete by 25% & 4% for M25 concrete and 22% & 3% for M45 concrete respectively SSP decreased the cost of concrete by 4 5% and 3 4% for both M25 and M45 concrete respectively The mix P2 and T9 for M25 and M45 concrete respectively was observed to be optimum in terms of strength and economical aspects
