## Method of Gold Extraction using Borax Small Scale Miners
20191122&ensp&#0183&enspThe GravityBorax Method GBM is still unknown to most Artisanal and smallscale gold miners (ASGMs) worldwide as most still use mercury to extract gold."Wholeore amalgamation" is a technique that requires the use of 10 25 g of mercury to produce 1 g of gold.Within the last eight years,it has become evident that this technique is more widely used than earlier anticipated,and artisanalHeavy Metals Hesperian Health GuidesWhen artisinal miners process silver or gold ore,they often mix the ore with mercury to make a soft substance called amalgam.When burned off to collect the gold,the mercury turns to a gas that can be breathed in by anyone nearby.Mercury can also become a gas if it is spilled or left in an open container.
