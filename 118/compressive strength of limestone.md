## Prediction of unconfined compressive strength of limestone,
Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) of the rock is one of the most crucial parameters in the analysis of geotechnical problems such as tunnel design,rock blasting and mechanical rock excavationConstruction and Building Materials CSHlimestone showed similar compressive strength values at 90 and 180 days compared to control mortar It can be derived from the low limestone inclusion level and consequently low dilution effect of limestone Differences between compressive strength values of

## Empirical relations between rock strength and,
Empirical relations between rock strength and physical,31 empirical equations are summarized that relate unconfined compressive strength and internal friction angle of sedimentary rocks (sandstone,shale,and limestone and dolomite) to physical properties (such as velocity,modulus,and porosity)compressive strength of brea limestone crusherasiaCompressive strength of Limestone is 30,000 lbs sq inch,which is the highest strength among the available stone category and can carry a suitable load ASTM C568 C568M 10 Standard Specification for Limestone.

## Properties of Limestone Physical Thermal
The hardness of Limestone is 34 whereas its compressive strength is 115.00 N mm 2.Streak is the color of rock when it is crushed or powdered.The streak of Limestone is white whereas its fracture is splintery.Luster of Limestone is the interaction of light with the surface of Limestone.Luster of LimestoneEffect of Limestone Powders on Compressive Strength andIn this study limestone powders with different particle sizes of 5,10 and 20 Î¼m were used to replace a part of Portland cement in different replacement levels to produce Portlandlimestone cement pastes.The percentages of limestone replacement are 0,5,7.5,10,12.5,15 and 20% by weight.The effect of fineness and the amount of limestone powders on compressive strength and setting time
