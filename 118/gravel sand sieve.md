## How to Build a Home Sand and Gravel Screen Hunker
Screen your own sand and gravel using a selfmade screen.You don't need to pay for commercially screened materials when they are sitting in your own backyard.The only difference between these natural materials is their size so sifting separates the gravel from sand and further sifting separates fine sand from coarse sand.Gravel pack design PetroWikiA sieve analysis is a laboratory routine performed on a formation sand sample for the selection of the propersized gravelpack sand.A sieve analysis consists of placing a formation sample at the top of a series of screens that have progressively smaller mesh sizes downwards in the sieve stack.
