Leaching in the grinding circuit is currently practiced in plants that process gold ores with low content of cyanide consuming minerals The high gold recovery observed in the grinding classification section of the plant is commonly explained by the inherent high initial dissolution rate of gold observed in gold ore cyanidation,or by the intense agitation prevailing in grinding millsLeaching & Adsorption Resource BookFactors Affecting the Rate of the Cyanidation Reaction Size of Gold Particles The gold must be in a fine particulate form (from the grinding circuit) The feed slurry must have an 80% passing size of 75um to achieve suitable gold recovery (refer to cyclone and grinding modules)

## How gold is made history,used,parts,procedure.
Gold is generally found in two types of deposits: lode (vein) or placer deposits; the mining technique used to extract the gold depends upon the type of deposit.Once extracted,the gold is refined with one of four main processes: floatation,amalgamation,cyanidation,or carbon in pulp.A New Age Gold Plant Flowsheet Gekko's500µm),then gravity recovery followed by intensive cyanidation of the gold concentrate.The gold in solution is then recovered either directly with electrowinning or with activated carbon in columns.Importantly,typically 90% of the tailings will not be exposed to cyanide a significant consideration for minimising corporate exposure.
