## Behaviour of Concrete on Replacement of Sand with …
In order to study the strength behaviour and fire resistance of the concrete made with full replacement of sand with Quarry stone dust the tests are conducted.Results so obtained for the tests conducted on cubes and prisms for M25 and M40 grades of concrete with various dosages of super plasticiser at 7days and 28 days were tabulated.Effect of Fly Ash on Mortar Mixes with Quarry Dust as Fine2014212&ensp&#0183&enspAbstract.This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation carried out to evaluate the compressive strength and transverse strength of 1 : 3 mortar mixes in which natural sand was replaced with 20%,50%,and 100% quarry dust by weight which were further modified by partially replacing cement with four percentages (15%,20%,25%,and 30%) of low calcium fly ash.
