## Chromium Ore businessadvisorynetwork
In recent years,there has been a trend toward greater vertical integration in the production of chromium materials.That is,more companies are involved in the mining of chromite ore are also processing it into chromium metal,ferrochrome and,ultimately,stainless steel.Process for extracting chromium from chromium ores1976615&ensp&#0183&enspProcess of extracting chromium from a chromium ore or concentrate by oxidation,which comprises suspending the chromium ore or concentrate in a bath of molten salts and introducing an oxygencontaining gas into the suspension in a sufficient amount and for a sufficient amount of time to oxidize chromium therein.
