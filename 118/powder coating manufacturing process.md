## What is the Powder Coating Process? Southern Spring
The success of powder coating depends on two factors: the powder coating itself and the appliion process.The coating powder consists of chemical agents that can be altered based upon the needs of the end appliion.The base is a polymer resin,but various curatives,pigments,and additives are typically added to achieve differentIndustrial Powder Coating Process,Equipment,AdvantageIf you really aim at green manufacturing,you should try out industrial powder coaing solutions.The Powder Coating Process.1.Surface Preparation.This stage is the most important in industrial powder coating because any kind of mud or particles left on the surface of the part will lead to bad adhesion of the powder and local coating failure.

## Technology Interchange: The First Steps in Manufacturing
The process of manufacturing a powder coating is a relatively complex semicontinuous endeavor.The raw materials are committed early in the process and formula cannot be easily changed after extrusion.It is therefore very important to control the quality of the raw materials and the manufacturing process.The Review of Powder Coatings Scientific Research2016411&ensp&#0183&ensp3.Manufacturing Process and Coating Process 3.1.Manufacturing Process The manufacturing of powder coatings was different from other kinds of coatings.Resin,pigment,filler,curing agent and other additives were mixed in certain proportion.Then the compositions was extruded,crushed and screened to gain powder of coating.
