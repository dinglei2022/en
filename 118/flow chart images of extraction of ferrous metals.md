The results show that crossflow air sifting leads to the highest accumulation of nonferrous metals in a residue fraction.From this fraction,the highest extraction of tin with minimal copper extraction was achieved.Download fullsize image Fig.1.This procedure (flow chart in Fig.4) consisted of comminution in two stages using aExtraction of Iron Metallurgy Blast Furnace and ReactionsIt is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.The extraction of iron from its ore is a long and subdued process,that helps in separating the useful components from the waste materials such as slag.What happens in the Blast Furnace? The purpose of a Blast Furnace is to reduce the concentrated ore chemically to its liquid metal state.

## EXTRACTION OF IRON EXTRACTION OF IRON FROM HAEMATITE
Extraction of iron is based on the reduction of HAEMATITE (Fe 2 O 3) Ferrous oxide is also oxidized to ferric oxide.Reduction of ore : The process of reduction is carried out in a blast furnace.Blast Furnace : The blast furnace is a cylindrical tower like structure about 25m toHow Hydrometallurgy and the SX EW Process Made Copper theCopper is traditionally known as the &quotred&quot metal after its natural color.However,it is also known as a &quotgreen&quot metal for the green patina that it acquires due to weathering.Indeed,patinized copper is the architectural focal point of many modern buildings for its natural look.
