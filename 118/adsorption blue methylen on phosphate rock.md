## Standard Test Method for Methylene Blue Index of Clay
31 Tests run on many clays generally indicate that a straight line relationship exists between the methylene blue index (MBI) and such fundamental clay properties as cation exchange capacity,dry bond strength,and casting rate Where the colloidal portion of the clay is kaolinite,there is also a direct correlation with specific surface (as determined by nitrogen adsorption)Hydrogen phosphate anions modified, ScienceDirect,Hydrogen phosphate anions modified hydrogen titanate nanotubes for methylene blue adsorption from aqueous solution: Validating novel method of predicting adsorption capacity
