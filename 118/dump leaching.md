## 【heap and dump leaching】
The lowgrade gold ore is generally recovered by the method of heap or dump leaching,which has an advantage such as less investment,largescale,simple operation and so on.、HEAP LEACHING MetsimThe heap leach module performs mass balances around the heap leach process including chemical reactions,precipitation and evaporation,solids and water inventories,heap drainage and control logic.With the incorporation of the Contouring Module,any heap type geometry may be accurately constructed,including:&nbsp;.
