## Optimization of mill performance by using
As the ball wear rate depends directly on the surface of the media charge,a small variation in power will lead to an important increase of wear rate.The risk of underloading or overloading the mill is an additional factor.A direct measurement of the ball level in the mill,more accurate than power readings,as well as a control of it,isball mill power draw calculationthe ball mill energy being used to grind target (oversize) particles.This paper describes.Definitions and example calculation.The typical closed ball mill.the mill power draw,it is directly related to overall

## AMIT 135: Lesson 7 Ball Mills &amp; Circuits Mining Mill.
Mill Power Draw.The motor power draw required to turn a mill from rest to the operating speed includes the energy required for the initial starting torque and mechanical arrangements to rotate the mill.It is generally accepted that practical mill power (PM ) is a function of mill capacity and diameter,i.e.P M = Mill Constant * (Mill.An improved contact model for ball mill simulation by …The experimental data of Moys [15] on a similar mill was chosen to compare the power draw.The mill was bullet5tted with nine square lifter bars of 0:02 &#163; 0:02 m in cross section.The grinding media were made up of graded charge of 0.012,0.018 and 0.025 m steel balls with a …
