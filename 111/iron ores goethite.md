## Iron Ore Mineral Fact Sheets Australian Mines Atlas
Most iron ores mined today comprise the iron oxide minerals hematite,Fe2O3 (70% Fe); goethite,Fe2O3s H2O,(63% Fe); limonite,a mixture of hydrated iron oxides (up to 60% Fe); and magnetite,Fe3O4 (72% Fe).Most of the world&#39;s important iron ore resources occur in iron rich sedimentary rocks known as banded iron&nbsp;.goethite mineral BritannicaBecause it is formed near the surface,goethite is the major component of the gossan of iron sulfide deposits in locations such as Arizona and of lateritic deposits.

The reactivities of iron ores differ greatly.Limonite goethite &quot;soft&quot; ore is a very active oxidation catalyst (e.g.for benzene and phenol),a property that may be useful in cleaning up crude sintering process offgases,whereas hematite magnetite &quot;hard&quot; ore is not.The latter,however strongly promotes condensation of phenol to&nbsp;.Origin of sedimentary hosted high grade iron ore deposits Natural.model of Leith (1903) applied to all high grade iron ore deposits.
