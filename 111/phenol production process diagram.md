## Sulfonation and Sulfation Processes Chemithon
The air SO3 sulfonation process is the lowest SO3 cost of any sulfonation process and is extremely versatile,producing very high quality products.However,it is a continuous process best suited to large production volumes.In addition,it requires expensive precision equipment and highly trained operating personnel.Figure 8.Air SO3Phenolic Compound an overview ScienceDirect TopicsThis high phenol production is mainly due to the high lignin content of PKS (~ 47 wt%) compared with that of typical woody biomass (~ 15 40 wt%) [40].The lignin composition would also influence the phenol yield.If the lignin has high contents of monomeric units with empty ortho and parasites,the phenol production increases.
