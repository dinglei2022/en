## Ball mill Wikipedia
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow&nbspFabrication of nano Rhizama Chuanxiong particles and,Nano Rhizoma Chuanxiong particles,with average particle size 1945 nm were successfully prepared by HSCSP with 30 min,at 1400 rpm of the ball mill speed and at 52% mass fraction [11] (Table 1).
