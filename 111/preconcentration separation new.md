## Molecular Microfluidic Bioanalysis: Recent Progress in.
This chapter reviews the state of art of microfluidic devices for molecular bioanalysis with a focus on the key functionalities that have to be successfully integrated,such as preconcentration,separation,signal amplification,and detection.The first part focuses on both passive and electrophoretic separation sorting methods,whereas the second part is devoted to miniaturized biosensors.Preconcentration and Separation of Mixed Species …In the device,sample preconcentration is achieved by means of the ion concentration polarization effect induced at the micro nano interface under the application of an external electric field,while species separation is achieved by exploiting the different electrophoretic mobilities of the sample components.
