## Loose bulk density qaanswers
The loose bulk density is measured on a sample of loose ore,that has not been allowed to self compact over time,and has not been mechanically compacted It will generally measure between 50% and 60% of the value of the solid densityBulk Density Measurement Fact Sheets soilquality.auBulk Density Measurement Key points.Bulk density is the weight of soil in a given volume.Soils with a bulk density higher than 1.6 g cm3 tend to restrict root growth.Bulk density increases with compaction and tends to increase with depth.Sandy soils are more prone to high bulk density.
