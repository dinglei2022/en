## Cold Rolling Process Overview Matmatch
Cold rolling takes the hot rolled product and processes it further After hot rolling,the steel is cooled to room temperature,then passed through cold rollers at a temperature lower than its recrystallisation temperature This rolling process is called annealing and relieves stress and leads to a higher yield strength and greater hardness1 Hot rolling and rolling defects: 11 Front and back,Oils,soap emulsions,fatty acids are used as lubricants during hot rolling non ferrous metals Mineral oils,paraffin,fatty acids are used for cold rolling Normally,foe ferrous alloys no lubricant is used 17 Rolling mill control: Production of continuous sheets and strips is one of the attractive features of modern rolling mills
