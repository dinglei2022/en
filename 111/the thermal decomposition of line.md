The behaviors of thermal decomposition of the three peroxides in the C80 show the differences in reactivity.TBPA and DTBP are controlled by the thermal homolysis in which the decarboxylation takes places to a very high extent.CHP is more likely controlled by the induced composition.The slope of the line is the reaction rate,k is a.Mass spectrometry characterization of the thermal decomposition.10 Aug 2011.characterization of the thermal decomposition digestion (TDD) at.by off line thermal decomposition electrospray ionization (ESI) MS,&nbsp;.
