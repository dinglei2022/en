## Effect of insoluble amine on bubble surfaces on particle.
Abstract.This study shows that in the potash flotation system,in which long chain amine collector appears in the form of colloidal particles,the hydrophobicity of sylvite surfaces critically depends on whether the amine is placed onto the solid surface or onto the surface of a bubble.Potash flotation practice for carnallite …TY JOUR.T1 Potash flotation practice for carnallite resources in the Qinghai Province,PRC.AU Wang,Xuming.AU Miller,J.D.AU Cheng,Fangqin

## Collector for flotation of clay minerals from potash ores.
 · The invention relates to a flotation process for removal of slimes from potash ores wherein a collector is used selected from the group of ethoxylated fatty amines having the formulae (formula I) wherFull range of AkzoNobel optimised. International MiningFlotation is also used to remove slime prior to the main flotation step,starting with flocculation by a polyacrylamide and then flotation of clay flocculants by a collector.Ethomeen® HT 40 is designed by AkzoNobel especially for this application.
