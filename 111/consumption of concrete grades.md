The water cement ratio is the ratio of the weight of water to the weight of cement used in a concrete mix.A lower ratio leads to higher strength and durability,but may make the mix difficult to work with and form.Workability can be resolved with the use of plasticizers or super plasticizers.Often,the ratio refers to the ratio of water to cement plus pozzolan ratio,w (c+p).The concrete conundrumThe concrete conundrum Concrete is the single most widely used material in the world and it has a carbon footprint to match.James Mitchell Crow looks at some of the approaches being used to ease the material’s environmental impact ACITORE DREAMSTIME.COM CW.03.08.Concrete.indd 62 19 02 2008 10:42:24
