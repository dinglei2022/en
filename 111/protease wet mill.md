## Application of High Intensity Ultrasound and Protease.
The steeping and steepwater evaporation are the two most capital and energy intensive processes in a corn wet milling operation,which limit new plant construction and production expansion.This project will explore a new technology that utilizes the combination of high iUS5292537AA process for stabilizing rice bran containing protein and a naturally occurring lipase enzyme that causes rancidity.The rice bran is treated with an antilipase enzyme,preferably a nonspecific protease of plant or fungal origin.Treatment with the antilipase enzyme stabilizes the rice bran against rancidity without

## protease wet mill
An enzymatic corn wet milling process has been developed that replaces or reduces the use of sulfur dioxide (SO 2) by using proteolytic enzymes.An acid fungal protease (GC106) was evaluated in this process,and its dose was optimized for starch yield using a laboratory enzymatic wet milling procedure.Corn wet millingCorn wet milling is a process where components of corn kernels are extracted to produce a highly purified product.Most of the products from this process are valuable and mainly required by the food industry.Through this process,every part of the corn is useful to produce the quality ingredients.
