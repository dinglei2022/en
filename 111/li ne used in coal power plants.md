## Coal Fired Thermal Power Plant an overview,
Coal is the dominating fuel source used in thermal power plants for generation of electricity At the coal fired thermal power plants,the raw coal is first pulverized to the shape of flour before it is force fed to the furnace During the pulverization process,the clay particles entrapped in the cracks of coal get separated from the coalCoal Handling Plant In Thermal Power PlantThe initial process in coal based thermal power plant is coal handling.The Function of coal Handling Plant in thermal power plant is to receive,process,store,feed the coal bunkers consistently over entire life of the power plant.Coal is transported in thermal power station either by railways,roadways or rope ways.
