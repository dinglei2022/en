## Copper Mining and Extraction: Sulfide Ores
The main ores of copper are sulfides and oxides.From their chemical formulas you can calculate the percentage of copper in each mineral.However this is not the same as the percentage of copper in the ore as that also contains unwanted silies and other minerals,called gangue,that will have toOxygen,Chemical Element Chemistry ExplainedOxygen is the first element in Group 16 (VIA) of the periodic table.The periodic table is a chart that shows how chemical elements are related to each other.
