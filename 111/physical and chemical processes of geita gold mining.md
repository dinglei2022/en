Copper is ideal for electrical wiring because it is easily worked,can be drawn into fine wire and has a high electrical conductivity.Copper in the environment.Copper is a very common substance that occurs naturally in the environment and spreads through the environment through natural phenomena.Humans widely use copper.Gold Mining The Environmental Literacy CouncilMost rich veins of gold,where gold could be separated in solid chunks from the surrounding ore,have been exhausted.Today,gold mining is as much about chemistry of solvents as it is about the rough physics of a shovel and pick axe.This is because today gold is now primarily found in very low concentrationsâ€”less than 10 grams per ton.

Underlying physical and chemical processes of formation are common to many metallic and nonmetallic ore deposits.A good deal of data is lacking about the processes of ore formation,ranging from how metals are released from source rocks through transport toDiamond Mining Methods Diamond Museum Cape TownA single blast can break approx.3,000 tonnes of ore.Once the ore is broken,excavators load the ore into haul trucks and transport it to a primary ore crusher where the diamond extracting process begins.The Kimberley Big Hole is an example of openpit mining.In underground mining,miners tunnel through Earth's crust to the kimberlite pipe

## Tailingsfo What are tailings? Their nature and production
Mechanical and chemical processes are used to extract the desired product from the run of the mine ore and produce a waste stream known as tailings.This process of product extraction is never 100% efficient,nor is it possible to reclaim all reusable and expended processing reagents and chemicals.Mining And Mineral Processing The Lithosphere SiyavulaWe will now discuss gold mining in more detail to gain a better understanding of the mining process.Gold mining (ESBRJ) Gold had long been known in Africa by the indigenous people,but in the late 1800's colonists found gold reefs and started exploiting the resource.
