## Pulverizer Wikipedia
Depending on the required coal fineness,there are two types of classifier that may be selected for a vertical roller mill The dynamic classifier,which consists of a stationary angled inlet vane assembly surrounding a rotating vane assembly or cage,is capable of producing micrometer fine pulverized coal with a narrow particle size.Aged particles derived from emissions of coal fired power,All three coal fired power plants used ESPs,but Plant 3 also used a wet FGD scrubber,and emissions from this plant had substantially higher primary particle mass (478 mg m 3,as compared to about 10 mg m 3 at the other plants) and number concentrations than those from the other plants
