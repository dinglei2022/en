## Manganese toxicity upon overexposure
Manganese (Mn) is a required element and a metabolic byproduct of the contrast agent mangafodipir trisodium (MnDPDP).The Mn released from MnDPDP is initially sequestered by the liver for first pass elimination,which allows an enhanced contrast for diagnostic imaging.Manganism WikipediaManganese may affect liver function,but the threshold of acute toxicity is very high.On the other hand,more than 95 percent of manganese is eliminated by biliary excretion.Any existing liver damage may slow this process,increasing its concentration in blood plasma.The exact neurotoxic mechanism of manganese is uncertain but there are clues pointing at the interaction of manganese with.

## Cellular manganese content is developmentally regulated in human
Oct 28,2014 Because optimal intracellular Mn concentrations likely change over developmental time and lineage,we postulated that neurons,and perhaps other cells,have celllevel homeostatic processes that regulate intracellular Mn content to cover cellular physiological demands while preventing cytotoxicity.Manganese Linus Pauling Institute Oregon State UniversityWound healing is a complex process that requires increased production of.μg) L as the maximum allowable manganese concentration in drinking water (33).
