## Properties of Solutions Boundless Chemistry
For example,table salt (NaCl) dissolves easily into water (H 2 O) because both molecules are polar.Intermolecular Forces and Their Importance in Solution Formation.There are two conceptual steps to form a solution,each corresponding to one of the two opposing forces that dictate solubility.General Chemistry Print version Wikibooks,open booksJun 11,2015&nbsp&#0183&#32For instance,a helium ion that has 2 less electrons than usual has a charge of +2,and a bromide ion with one more electron than usual has a charge of 1.(This may seem backwards,but remember that an electron has a negative charge.) Notice that charge not only applies to subatomic particles,but also ions and other things as well.
