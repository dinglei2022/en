## How do you recognize limestone and marble? [USGS]
The main difference between limestone and marble is that limestone is a sedimentary rock,typically composed of calcium carbonate fossils,and marble is a metamorphic rock.Limestone forms when shells,sand,and mud are deposited at the bottom of oceans and lakes and over time solidify into rock.The green coloured rocks in the centre are made of chalk.Chalk is a good aquifer,a store for water.This example is from northern France.
