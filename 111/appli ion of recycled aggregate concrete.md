## A review of recycled aggregate in concrete appliions
Recovery rates of recycled aggregate vary from almost 100 percent in some parts of the world to nearly zero in countries where most construction waste ends up in the landﬁll.For example,Japan is a leading country in recycling concrete waste and has been implementing 98% recycling and using it for structural concrete appliions [17].Research and Appliion of Recycled Aggregate ConcreteThe project appliion of RAC showed that the compression strength of the concrete adding 80∼100% recycled concrete coarse aggregate could reach C35 (35MPa∼40MPa) and the flexural strength could be higher than 5.0 MPa at 28 d,both of which satisfied the requirement in the heavy and special heavy traffic road,and could open to traffic at 3 d.
