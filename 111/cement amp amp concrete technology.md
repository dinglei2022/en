## Concrete Technology cement
In its simplest form,concrete is a mixture of paste and aggregates (rocks).The paste,composed essentially of portland cement and water,coats the surface of the fine (small) and coarse (larger) aggregates.Through a series of chemical reactions called hydration,the paste hardens and gains strength to form the rocklike mass known as concrete.Civil Concrete Technology Lectures Notes Civil EngineeringCivil Concrete Technology Lectures Notes Concrete Definition In its simplest form,concrete is a mixture of paste and aggregates (rocks).The paste,composed essentially of portland cement and water,coats the surface of the fine (small) and coarse (larger) aggregates.Through a series of chemical reactions called hydration,the paste hardens and gains strength to form the rocklike mass known
