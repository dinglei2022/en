## Thallium poisoning
Thallium poisoning is poisoning due to thallium and its compounds which are often highly toxic.[1] Contact with skin is dangerous,and adequate ventilation should be provided when melting this metal.[2] Many thallium(I) compounds are highly soluble in water and are readily absorbed through the skin.[citation needed] Exposure to them should not.Thallium SpringerLinkMonovalent compounds such as thallium sulfate (Tl 2 SO 4) and thallium acetate (CH 3 COOTl) tend to be more toxic [2].Thallium occurs naturally in various ores and is typically recovered from flue dust and residuals produced from the smelting of zinc,copper,and lead [3].Thallium salts dissolve readily in water and are odorless and tasteless.
