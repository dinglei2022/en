## HOW CAN I MAKE ECCENTRIC CONE IN AUTOCAD? ,
Jul 31,2009&#0183;&#32;HOW CAN I MAKE ECCENTRIC CONE IN AUTOCAD? Follow 1 answer,don't worry Here are the steps (Ok,so I use Autodesk Inventor) 1 Make a plane,and draw the base circle of the cone,which is above the first plane with a distance equal to the height of the cone Now draw a point eccentric from the lower circle's centre,3d excentric taper archpubIt is possible to create an elliptical cone.An elliptical cone,sliced at the correct plane will create a circular base.Note: Requires some math and ucs manipulation.Slicing again closer to the apex will give you an eccentric truned cone.Once you master the eccentric cone,many more shapes are possible in vanilla AutoCAD.See attached
