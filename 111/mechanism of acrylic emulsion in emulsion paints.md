## The Effect of Surfactant Selection on Emulsion Polymer
Experimental.Polymerization Semicontinuous polymerization was used to produce the acrylic latexes for this study.A polymer seed was formed adding 2% monomer preemulsion at the beginning of the reaction,the remainder being added according to a predetermined schedule during theStudy on Stability and Stability Mechanism of StyreneIn this study,nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) was grafted with lauric acid,palmitic acid,and stearic acid and used as stabilizer to prepare styrene butyl acrylate emulsion.The properties of the emulsion were determined,and the mechanism of modified NCC (MNCC) stabilized emulsion was analyzed.Results showed that longchain fatty acids were grafted to NCC through esterifiion initiated

## Production of Emulsion House Paint Using Polyvinyl Acetate,
Standard emulsion paint formulation and method of production were employed All the six samples gave high quality emulsion paints in terms of opacity,adhesion,ease of application and coverage However,it was observed that paint brightness diminished with increased gum Arabic composition; Sample F,What is emulsion paint? BBC Science Focus Magazine14 08 2020&#0183;&#32;Nearly half of emulsion paint is made up of water Binders 25 per cent Acrylic or epoxy polymers surround the pigments and help them to bind to the wall Other additives 5 per cent These include biocides to stop algae and fungi growing on your,
