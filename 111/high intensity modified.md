Highintensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a noninvasive therapy that makes entire coagulative necrosis of a tumor in deep tissue through the intact skin.There are many reports about the HIFU's efficacy in the treatment of patients with breast cancer,but randomized clinical trials are rare which emphasize on the systematic assessment of histological changes in the ablated tumorAnalysis of high density lipoproteins by a modified gradient gel.Abstract A high resolution electrophoretic method has been developed to separate plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles by size using 4 3076.
