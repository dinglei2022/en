Minerals are substances that are formed naturally in the Earth Minerals are usually solid,inorganic,have a crystal structure,and form naturally by geological process The study of minerals is called mineralogy A mineral can be made of single chemical element or more usually a compoundThere are over 4,000 types of known minerals Two common minerals are quartz and feldsparDescribe the structure of mineralsI Mineral Structure •To understand what a crystalline structure is,you need to know a little about the elements that make up a mineral C Elements are pure substances that cannot be separated or broken down into simpler substances by chemical means

## Crystal structure Wikipedia
In crystallography,crystal structure is a description of the ordered arrangement of atoms,ions or molecules in a crystalline material Ordered structures occur from the intrinsic nature of the constituent particles to form symmetric patterns that repeat along the principal directions of three dimensional space in matterStructure of Clay Minerals What is Clay Western UniversityThe Structure of two common clay minerals Silica Alumina Silica hydrogen ions Alumina Alumina Alumina Silica Silica Silica Silica potassium ions potassium ions In both cases,silica sheets and alumina sheets are covalently bonded (oxygen atoms share electrons) The result is a
