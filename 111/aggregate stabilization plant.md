## Does mycorrhizal inoculation improve plant survival
Soil cores were assayed for their aggregate stability coefficient (ASC),root length density (RLD),and mean root diameter (MRD).Inoculation improved plant survival significantly,but it delayed aggregate stabilization relative to the noninoculated site.Higher aggregate stability occurred only after three growing seasons.Aggregate Inspection Report Report on Sample of Culvert Metal Daily Report of Asphalt Plant Inspection Drum Plant Daily Report on AggregateFly Ash Stabilization Physical Testing Laboratory Monthly Report Road Surface Roughness Evaluation Ready Mix Concrete Plant Inspection Report New Product,Material,Equipment or Process Evaluation
