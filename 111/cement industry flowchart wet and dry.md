Wet grinding of hard minerals is usually much more efficient than dry grinding.When slurry is dried in the kiln,it forms a granular crumble that is ideal for subsequent heating in the kiln.In the dry process,it is very difficult to keep the fine powder rawmix in the kiln,because the fastflowing combustion gases tend to blow it back out again.Cement Manufacturing Process Flow Chart hotcrusherCement Manufacturing Process Flow Chart Cement manufacturing process is mainly divided into three stages,namely,raw meal preparation,clinker burning and cement grinding.Generally speaking,the cement industry production is Portland cement.
