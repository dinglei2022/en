Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminium.The impurities present in bauxite are SiO2,iron oxides and titanium oxide (TiO2).Al2O3 is extracted out as sodium aluminate.The impurity,SiO2 too dissolves forming sodium silicate.Other impurities are left behind.Al2O3 + 2NaOH + 3H2O → 2Na[Al(OH)4] Thus,leaching is used to remove the impurities present and hence option A is the correct option.BauxiteBauxite.Bauxite is the most important ore of aluminum which contains only 30 54% alumina,Al2O3; the rest is a mixture of silica,various iron oxides,and titanium dioxide along with trace amounts of zinc,phosphorous,nickel,vanadium etc.as indicated earlier.
