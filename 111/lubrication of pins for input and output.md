## Orcad question connecting output pins to an input pin
May 15,2010&nbsp&#0183&#32I'll explain why I want to connect two output pins to an input pin.The input pin is the RSTn pin of an 8051 Uc.Output pin #1 is a pullup switch (when the switch is held down,it grounds the RSTn pin of the Uc).Output pin #2 is a RSTn signal of an evaluation board,which I use in order to burn firmware into the Uc and to debug the Uc.PIC16F877 Tutorial Input Ouput Ports and TRIS RegistersPin RA4 is multiplexed with the “Timer0” module clock input to become the RA4 T0CKI pin and functioning either input output operation or Timer 0 clock functioning module.The RA4 T0CKI pin is a Schmitt Trigger input and an open drain output.

## 74HC390 question: Choosing input and output pins
 · I would like to know how the initial input and subsequent overall output pins are chosen.I realise that using several flip flops is a matter of strapping one output to another input,but it is the choice of order that puzzles me.Once I've found someone who can explain how this is done,I'll post more detail if required.DLA Document Services,Building 4 D,700 Robbins Avenue,Philadelphia,PA 19111 5094.Address questions to ASSIST Help Desk at 215 737 8000 [DSN: 444 8000 ].
