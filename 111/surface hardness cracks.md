## Hardness ndeed
Hardness.Hardness is the resistance of a material to localized deformation.The term can apply to deformation from indentation,scratching,cutting or bending.In metals,ceramics and most polymers,the deformation considered is plastic deformation of the surface.Application Notes: Detection of hairline cracks in bearings for.Technically,such cracks near the surface are difficult to detect,as optical inspection methods very quickly reach their limits with fine hairline cracks.However.

## CFA: Concrete Cracking Overview
Surface moisture evaporates faster than it can be replaced by rising bleed water,causing the surface to shrink more than the interior concrete.As the interior concrete restrains shrinkage of the surface concrete,stresses can develop that exceed the concrete's tensile strength,resulting in surface cracks.eFunda: Factors Affect Fatigue LifeNevertheless,forging can cause decarburiztion (loss of surface carbon atoms) which is harmful to fatigue life.Hot rolling can also cause decarburiztion (loss of surface carbon atoms),a damaging lose regarding the fatigue life.Carburizing and nitriding produce higher strength and hardness at the surface and thus improves fatigue life.

## Correlation of shot peening parameters to surface
High depth of compressive residual stress poo are required when fatigue cracks initiate under the surface,andlor to increase crack growth resistance A2 Amplitude of compressive residual stress depend on shot direction angle.Amplitude of compressive residual stress isInvestigation of Surface Hardness of Steels in CyanideInvestigation of Surface Hardness of Steels in Cyanide Salt Bath Heat Treatment Process S.P Ayodeji,T.E Abioye and S.O Olanrewaju Abstract Carbonitriding of four types of steels,namely,low carbon steel (LCS),medium carbon steel (MCS),low alloy steel (LAS) and high alloy steel (HAS) was achieved using cyanide salt bath heat treatment process.

## How does one investigate the reasons metal cracks? ResearchGate
For example a crack beside welding,propagates in base metal and tangent to the weld.The principal strategy is to study the crack: origin,form,surface topography.What is the relationship between hardness and strength of an alloy?
