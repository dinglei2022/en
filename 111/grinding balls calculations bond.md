## Ball Mill Design Power Calculation
The basic parameters used in ball mill design (power calculations),rod mill or any tumbling mill sizing are; material to be ground,characteristics,Bond Work Index,bulk density,specific density,desired mill tonnage capacity DTPH,operating % solids or pulp density,feed size as F80 and maximum ‘chunk size’,product size as P80 and maximum and finally the type of circuit open closed.Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum GrindingIn Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize “just in case” Well,this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and tear

## Mill (grinding) Wikipedia
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processThere are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them Historically mills were powered by hand (eg,via a hand crank),working animal (eg,horse mill),wind or water ()CALCULATION OF THE POWER DRAW OF DRY,by Erdem (2002) for dry multi component cement grinding ball mills,using the results of the Bond ball mill grindability test For all model based methods,a reliable method to calculate mill power draw for a given mill is required for the calculation of power draw Morrell (1996) proposed a
