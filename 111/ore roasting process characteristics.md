## Copper Mining and Extraction: Sulfide Ores
The roasting process: changes some of the CuFeS 2 to copper oxide; removes some of the sulfur as sulfur dioxide; This is done by heating the concentrated ore from froth flotation.It is heated to between 500 °C and 700 °C in air.The product from the roaster is called calcine.It is a solid mixture of oxides,sulfides and sulfates.Roasting Definition in Chemistry ThoughtCo09 09 2019&#0183;&#32;Updated September 09,2019 Roasting Definition: Roasting is a process in metallurgy in which a sulfide ore is heated in air The process may convert a metal sulfide to a metal oxide or to a free metal Example: Roasting ZnS may yield ZnO; roasting HgS may yield free Hg metal Cite this Article
