## Radionuclide fluxes at a plant manufacturing dicalcium
The annual consumption of phosphate rock at the plant is roughly 70,000 metric tons.When the phosphate ore arrives at the plant different kinds of impurities have already been removed by flotation and the phosphorus content is about 12 13%.Before the phosphate rock enters the manufacturing process it is milled and passed through a 1 mm sieve.41 Reliable Feed Dicalcium Phosphate Manufacturers from China.Source high quality 137 Feed Dicalcium Phosphate from China ‚òÜ Select from 41.Dicalcium phosphate feed is the feed preparation of raw materials, ISO.
