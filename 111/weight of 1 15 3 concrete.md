The area of the driveway is 1,080 square feet (60 feet x 18 feet) According to the table above,one cubic yard of concrete placed at a thickness of 5 inches covers 65 square feet In a perfect universe,our 1,080 square foot driveway will need exactly 1662 cubic yards of concrete (1,080 square feet 65 square feet equals 1662 cubic yards)How to Calculate Quantities of Cement,Sand and Aggregate,In the step 3 of “How To Calculate Quantities Of Cement,Sand And Aggregate For Nominal Concrete Mix (1:2:4)” you have calculated that: 01 cum of concrete will require Cement required = 1 0167 = 598 Bags ~ 6 Bags Sand required = 115 0167 = 688 Kgs or 1498 cft,
