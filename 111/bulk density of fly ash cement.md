## Cement Kiln Dust Pneumatic Conveying System Macawber
Holcim Cantagalo recently came to Macawber Engineering's Brazilian licensee,PDL Sistemas for a quality Cement Kiln Dust pneumatic conveying system for an intermediate system conveying to a final storage silo.This is to replace a pressurized silo truck which led toEffect of Density and Porosity on the Durability of Flyashmicrostructural properties of fly ash particles,silica and calcium content have a significant effect on the porosity and the bonding of Fly ash concrete.The existence of capillary pores and air voids influences concrete permeability to a large extent.Concrete density is inversely proportional to its porosity.

KEYWORDS: fly ash,pozzolan,lignite,cement,coal.2 also shows that the bulk density of fly ash increases with a decrease in particle size indicating that light.CHAPTER 3 FLY ASH BASED GEOPOLYMER CONCRETEaverage density of fly ashbased geopolymer concrete is similar to that of OPC concrete (2400 kg m3).Knowing the density of concrete,the combined mass of alkaline liquid and fly ash can be derived.By assuming the ratio of alkaline liquid to fly ash as 0.4,mass of fly ash and mass of alkaline liquid was found out.
