## Aqua Regia Extraction : Prospecting reddit
One troy ounce of gold will dissolve in only 75 mL of 4:1 aqua regia That said,unless your ore was in the ounce per pound range,aqua regia would not be very practical to extract gold from ore Aqua regia's decomposition would be catalyzed by the presence of the other metals,oxides,and sulfides present in the ore,and you'd need a lot of it.Public Lab: Hydrogen Sulfide tarnishing SilverSep 11,2011&#0183;&#32;It is,however,attacked by nitric acid (forming the nitrate) and by hot concentrated sulfuric ac Silver is almost always monovalent in its compounds,but an oxide,a fluoride,and a sulfide of divalent silver are known It does not oxidize in air but reacts with the hydrogen sulfide present in the air,forming silver sulfide (tarnish)

## will gold dissolve if sulfide is present
A refractory ore generally contains sulfide minerals,organic carbon,or both Sulfide minerals are impermeable minerals that occlude gold particles,making it difficult for the leach solution to form a complex with the gold Organic carbon present in gold ore may adsorb dissolved gold cyanide complexes in much the same way as activated carbonThe Determination of Sulfate and Sulfide Sulfur in,1919,p 368 372) failed to dissolve insoluble sulfides in minerals such as chalcocite,bornite,and chalcopyrite,Any insoluble sulf ate present remains with the precip&#173;,Cadmium chloride is added to precipitate any sulfide ion that may be liberated in the digestion This addition insures that no sulfide sulfur is oxidized in the.
