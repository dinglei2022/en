## How Portland Cement is Made? Manufacturing Process of
Portland cement can be made by following two different processes a dry one and a wet one.Joseph Aspdin first made portland cement in his kitchen stove in England in the 19th century.Lime and silica make up approximately 85% of portland cement.The materials that are commonly used are limestone,shells,chalk,shale,clay,slate,silica sand,and iron ore.Cement Manufacturing Process: What is Cement …1 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Methods of Manufacturing Process of Cement.At present Portland Cement is manufactured by two processes,Dry Process,and Wet Process.The main difference between these two methods of manufacturing of cement is that in the dry process,calcareous and argillaceous raw materials are fed into the burning kilns in a perfectly dry state.
