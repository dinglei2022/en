Mar 27,2013&nbsp&#0183&#32To plan projects,it is important to understand volunteers' motivations for participating.This paper analyzes results from an online survey of nearly 11,000 volunteers in Galaxy Zoo,an astronomy citizen science project.Results show that volunteers' primary motivation is a desire to contribute to scientific research.Hubble and Galaxy Zoo find bars and baby galaxies don't mix.Jan 17,2014.He and the rest of the Galaxy Zoo science team used classifications.which has been made possible by the contributions of citizen scientists.

## Galaxy Zoo shows how well crowdsourced citizen science works.
Oct 26,2010.Galaxy Zoo has been an attempt to get citizen science to classify all the.Even though most people don't contribute that much,enough have.Crowd science user contribution patterns and their2014513&ensp&#0183&enspThe largest project (Planet Hunters) attracted 28,828 users in its first 180 d,whereas the smallest (Galaxy Zoo Supernovae) attracted 3,186.These users contributed a total of 129,540 h of unpaid labor,ranging from more than 54,000 h for the largest project to about 1,890 h for the smallest.
