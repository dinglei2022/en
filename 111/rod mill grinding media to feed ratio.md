Ball Mill Design.A survey of Australian processing plants revealed a maximum ball mill diameter of 5.24 meters and length of 8.84 meters (Morrell,1996).Autogenous mills range up to 12 meters in diameter.The length to diameter ratios in the previous table are for normal applications.For primary grinding,the ratio could vary between 1:1and.Rod mills,how they function Mine Engineer.ComRod mills are very similar to ball mills,except they use long rods for grinding media.The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill,similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill.To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling,the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6.
