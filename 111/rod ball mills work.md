## How to choose ball mill and rod mill? Bailing Machinery
Ball mills and rod mills are grinding equipment widely used in concentrators.The two have similarities in shape and grinding principles,but there are differences in structure,performance,and use.This article analyzes their similarities and differences from seven aspects,and tells you how to choose ball mill and rodBond Index Ball Mill Rod Mill BT 100 XLAt least 15 to 20 kg sample material is required to simulate a closed grinding circuit in a ball or rod mill.The Rod Mill Work Index (RWI) is used for particle size determination in a size range from 25 mm down to 2.1 mm whereas Ball Mill Work Index (BWI) is used for the range from 2.1 mm down to 100 &#181;m.Adjustment of grinding parameters:

## Rod Mill
As such,when the product is sticky,rod mills are preferred over ball mills.Rod mills have an industrial yield that is less than that of a ball mill,which explains the fact that balls have a much larger grinding surface than rods.The power needed to operate a rod mill could exceed 30% of the poweBall Mill Bond Work Index 3dinterierHere there are given tables from various sources for the Bond work index values of mining materials (ores,industrial minerals and rocks).These work indexes can be used for the determination of tumbling mills (rod,ball mills) power.

Bond Rod Mill Index Test (BRMWI) A Bond Rod Mill Index Test (BRMWI) is a standard test for determining the Rod Mill Work Index of a sample of ore.The BRMWI is a measure of the resistance of the material to crushing and grinding.It can be used to determine the grinding power required for a given throughput of material under rod mill grinding.Ball MillsBall Mills are generally used to grind material 1 4 inch and finer,down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns.To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills,they must be operated in a closed system,with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced.
