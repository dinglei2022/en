## Silver processing Britannica
Silver is generally found in the combined state in nature,usually in copper or lead mineralization,and by 2000 bce mining and smelting of silverbearing lead ores was under way.Lead ores were smelted to obtain an impure leadsilver alloy,which was then fire refined by cupellation.Ksp solubility product constants of many popular salts atBelow are the values of the Ksp product constant for the most common salts.We hope they will prove usefull to you.If there are any other salts for which you know the value of the constant,please let us know and we will update the table.

Silver refining,which is carried out following the separation of this metal in copper and lead smelting,is especially interesting.While the aim in other metal electrorefining processes is to produce a massive,dense product,with silver,fine,treelike dendrites are formed deliberately.The Mineral Gallery Sulfides ClassThe Sulfide Class minerals comprise an economically important class of minerals.Most major ores of important metals such as copper,lead and silver are sulfides.Strong generalities exist in this class.The majority of sulfides are metallic,opaque,generally sectile,soft to average in hardness and they have high densities,black or darkcolored streaks,and an igneous origin.
