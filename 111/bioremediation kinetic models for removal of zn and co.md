Abstract.Biosorption process is a promising technology for the removal of heavy metals from industrial wastes and effluents using lowcost and effective biosorbents.Removal of Heavy Metals from Mine Waters by NaturalIn this study,we investigated the removal of Fe,Pb,Cd,and Zn from synthetic mine waters by a natural zeolite.The emphasis was given to the zeolite's behavior toward a few ions in competition with each other.Pb was removed efficiently from neutral as well as from acidic solutions,whereas the uptake of Zn and Cd decreased with low pH and high iron concentrations.

## Remediation and desorption kinetics of pyrene from
Abstract Soils cocontaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals are challenging for remediation.In the present study desorption of pyrene in kaolinite,cocontaminated by Ni,Pb and Zn,was examined by combinations of surfactants and chelating agents such as Triton X100,Tween 80,Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) and citric acid.Multicomponent isotherm for biosorption of Zn(II),CO(IIA model describing the process of biosorption by a singlestage batch design was developed and verified based on the Temkin isotherm model.Fundamentally,the outlook from these observations of the experiments that the pretreated dried biomass is a suitable absorbent for the removal of significant amounts of the heavy metal from the effluents
