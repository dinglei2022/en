## Mineral processing Wikipedia
Gravity separation is one of the oldest technique in mineral processing but has seen a decline in its use since the introduction of methods like flotation,classifiion,magnetic separation and leaching.Gravity separation dates back to at least 3000 BC when Egyptians used the technique for separation of gold.gravity separation method of ore greenrevolutiongravity separation used to concentration of which ore gravity separation of iron ore magnetite alluvial gold gravity separation how a gravity separator works gravity separator machine concentration of megami manganese ore using gravity method crushed limestone specific gravity gravity separator for coal used gravity concentration tables

## Spiral Concentrator Outotec
During separation,the slurry enters the spiral through a feed box and then flows on to the spiral surface.As the slurry travels down the spiral,mineral grains settle and sort according to size,shape,and specific gravity.Spiral separation uses a flowing film principle based on the size and specific gravity difference present in a mineralBeneficiation of Iron Ores IspatGuru03 04 2014&#0183;&#32;DSO,gravity separation,Iron ore,iron ore beneficiation,magnetic separation,Beneficiation of Iron Or Iron ore is a mineral which is used after extraction and processing for the production of iron and steel The main ores of iron usually contain Fe2O3 (70 % iron,hematite) or Fe3O4 (72 % iron magnetite)
