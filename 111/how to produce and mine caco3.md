## 18.7: Solubility and pH
Acidic,Basic,and Amphoteric Oxides and Hydroxides One of the earliest classifications of substances was based on their solubility in acidic versus basic solution,which led to the classification of oxides and hydroxides as being either basic or acidic.Basic oxides and hydroxides either react with water to produce a basic solution or dissolve readily in aqueous acid.Lime Production from Limestonelime production from limestone Limestone products are commonly used in industrial processes and are naturally occurring consisting of high levels of calcium,magnesium carbonate and minerals Lime is used in many industries to neutralize acid waste and as an alkali for chemical processes,in agriculture,soil stabilization,building,and industrial purposes such as cement and steel production.
