## HMA Mix Design Fundamentals Pavement Interactive
Mix design is a process to manipulate three variables: (1) aggregate,(2) asphalt binder content and (3) the ratio of aggregate to asphalt binder with the objective of obtaining an HMA that is deformation resistant,fatigue resistant,low temperature crack resistant,durable,moisture damage resistant,skid resistant and workable.CONCRETE MIX DESIGN TECHNICIAN STUDY GUIDEThe following aggregate sources have exhibited alkalisilica reactivity in the field and or laboratory.Concrete mix designs with these aggregates require a pozzolan if the alkalinity of the cement exceeds 0.4 %,as required by Section 10241(A) of the NCDOT
