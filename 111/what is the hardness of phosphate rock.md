## Apatite Geology rocks and minerals
Apatite is a phosphate mineral (and is the most abundant phosphorousbearing mineral).The name actually covers three different minerals (fluorapatite,chlorapatite and hydroxylapatite) depending on the predominance of either fluorine,chlorine or the hydroxyl group.These ions can freely substitute in the crystal latticePhosphate WikipediaThe phosphate ion is a polyatomic ion with the empirical formula (PO 4) 3− and a molar mass of 9497 g mol It consists of one central phosphorus atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement The phosphate ion carries a −3 formal charge and is the conjugate base of the hydrogen phosphate ion,H(PO 4) 2−,which is the conjugate base of H

## Phosphorite Wikipedia
Phosphorite,phosphate rock or rock phosphate is a nondetrital sedimentary rock which contains high amounts of phosphate minerals.The phosphate content of phosphorite varies greatly,from 4% to 20% phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5).Marketed phosphate rock is enriched (&quotbeneficiated&quot) to at least 28%,often more thanUsing Rock Phosphate For Gardens What Does Rock,Rock phosphate,or phosphorite,is mined from clay deposits that contain phosphorus and is used to make organic phosphate fertilizers that many gardeners utilize In the past,rock phosphate was used alone as a fertilizer,but due to a lack in supply,as well as low concentration,most applied.

## Phosphine from rocks: mechanically driven phosphate reduction?
Phosphine was correlated to hardness and mechanical pulverization energy of the rocks.The yield of PH3 ranged from 0 to 0.01% of the total P content of the dissolved rock.Strong circumstantial evidence was gathered for reduction of phosphate in the rock via mechanochemical or &quottribochemical&quot weathering at quartz andPhosphate Rock Mosaic Crop NutritionSoil pH phosphate rock requires acid soil conditions to effectively nourish crops Use of phosphate rock is not usually recommended when the soil pH exceeds 55 Adding lime to raise soil pH and decrease aluminum toxicity may slow phosphate rock dissolution Soil P fixing capacity
