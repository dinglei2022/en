## Lecture 6 6 nptel.ac
Flotation is a process of separation and concentration based on differences in the physicochemical properties of interfaces.Flotation can take place either at a liquid gas,a liquid liquid,a liquid solid or a solid gas interface.For example,oil flotation takes place on the interface between oil and water.FilmFroth flotation Wikipedia2019109&ensp&#0183&enspSimple flotation circuit for mineral concentration.Numbered triangles show direction of stream flow.Various flotation reagents are added to a mixture of ore and water (called pulp) in a conditioning tank.The flow rate and tank size are designed to give the minerals enough time to be activated.The conditioner pulp [1] is fed to a bank of

## Optimizing Flotation Circuit Recovery by Effective Stage
Recovery is one of the most important metallurgical parameters in designing and evaluating flotation circuits.The present study used the recovery arrangement for two and three stage circuits to evaluate the effect of stage recovery on the overall circuit recovery and flotation circuit configuration.The results showed that mainly the highest recovery value should be assigned to the rougherMEI Blog: Flotation Chemistry vs Flotation PhysicsMar 06,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32Flotation Chemistry vs Flotation Physics.Some of the points above have been addressed by manufacturers of reagents,for example Cytec has developed polymeric reagents for gangue depression,but I haven't seen much academic research in this area.I would like to look at the question in a simple manner.For me,maximum recovery at a
