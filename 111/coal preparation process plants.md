## What is Coal Washing? Definition from Safeopedia
Coal washing is a process that is undertaken in a coal washery or coal preparation plant (CPP) where coal is refined or cleaned of impurities.Coal washing involves using water,mechanical techniques and relies on gravity and the difference of density between coal and it's impurities which are usually more densely packed due to the fact thatOptimized thickeners in coal preparation plantsmore efficient plant control.Level measurement equipment is part of almost every process in a coal mine.You hardly see the instruments but they are there and make a huge difference when it comes to efficiency,safety and automated control of the plant.All mining concentrators and coal preparation plants have tailings thickeners.
