## Cyclonic separation Wikipedia
Cyclonic separation is a method of removing particulates from an air,gas or liquid stream.Cyclones are also used in oil refineries to separate oils and gases,and in the cement industry as components of kiln preheaters.Similar separators are used in the oil refining industry (e.g.for Fluid catalytic cracking) to achieve fast.Introduction to Cyclone Separator 3d KnowledgeCyclonic separation is a method of removing particulates from an air,gas or liquid stream,without the use of filters,through vortex separation When removing particulate matter from liquids,a hydrocyclone is used; while from gas,a gas cyclone is used Rotational effects and gravity are used to separate mixtures of solids and fluids
