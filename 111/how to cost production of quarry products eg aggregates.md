## Manufacturing process Lafarge
The cement manufacturing process starts from the mining of raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing,mainly limestone and clays.A limestone quarry is inside the plant area and a clays quarry is as far from the plant area as 25 km.A Guide to Aggregate and its Supply and deliveryThe cost of the Limestone aggregates is comparatively less the granite sand.Secondary Aggregates: Made from small equipment.According to an estimate of Quarry Products Association in 2008.
