## (PDF) SIZE REDUCTION BY GRINDING METHODS
ball mills,grinding (steel) balls or pebbles are often added to stirred mills to help grind ore,howev er.these mills contain a large screw mounted ver tically to lift and grind material.Rod mills,how they function Mine EngineerRod mills are very similar to ball mills,except they use long rods for grinding media.The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill,similar to the grinding.

## Manufacturing process of grinding media balls
Transversal rolling of balls from the round billet is economical.It differs from other methods due to the possibility to produce grinding balls on the uninterrupted automated aggregates,which allows 2 to 8 times to increase the output and 1015% to reduce the consumption of metal.The process involves the following stages:Metal Weight Calculator Boston CenterlessMetal Weight Calculator.Choose the alloy type,shape,and number of pieces and enter the dimensions to calculate the total weight.
