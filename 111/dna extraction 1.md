Jan 13,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32DNA extraction from a sample is a process of purifying the DNA.The sample can be tissue,plant or animal cells,blood,viral DNA or any other DNA containing sample.The idea of extracting the DNA is quite basic: Disruption of the cell membrane (and cell wall in case of plant cells) to make the DNA exposed and then separate it from the rest ofExtract your own DNA Planet ScienceThe white strings and clumps you see are thousands of DNA molecules clumped together.Single DNA molecules are far too small to see with the naked eye.When you gargle the salt water,you are also collecting some bacterial cells from the inside of your mouth,so the DNA you see is a mixture of your DNA and bacterial DNA!
