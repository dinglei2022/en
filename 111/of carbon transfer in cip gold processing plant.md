## Carbon in pulp Wikipedia
2019930&ensp&#0183&enspCarbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.Introduced in the early 1980s,Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process.As such it is used in most industrial appliions where the presence of competing silver or copper does not prohibit its use.Activated Carbon movement study in gold CIL or CIP circuit20191024&ensp&#0183&enspThe operating costs associated with elution and regeneration are proportional to the rate of carbon transfer through the circuit.Optimum carbon flowrate must be balanced against the return that could be expected from investment of the value of the gold and carbon locked up in the plant.Source: Advances in Gold Ore Processing
