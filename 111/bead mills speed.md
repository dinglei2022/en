## Ball mill Wikipedia
The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials,and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement,silies,refractory material,fertilizer,glass ceramics,etc.as well as for ore dressing of both ferrous and nonferrous metals.The ball mill can grind various ores and other materials either wet or dry.Laboratory &amp Pigment Dispersers Rotor Stator HighThere are some appliions where extremely fine particles are required or the solid content is especially difficult to break down and disperse.These requirements need something besides a dissolver disc and that's where a bead or basket mill is used.Highspeed bead mills are very useful in dispersing otherwise difficult materials.
