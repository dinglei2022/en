## What is Pozzolana? Quora
Dec 29,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32Archaeological excavations have proven that pozzolana is one among the earliest binder used by man in the field of construction.Pozzolana are classified as an inorganic material either natural or artificial which hardens in water when mixed witEFFECT OF SILICA FUME AND METAKAOLINE POZZOLANA,When fine pozzolana particles are dispersed in the paste,they generate a large number of nucleation sites,smaller particles in the mixture Therefore,the addition of pozzolans to Portland cement increases its mechanical strength and durability,The kaoline was thermally activated at 850&#176;C for 2 hours The cement
