## Low Compressive Strength Concrete Engineering general
May 31,2010&nbsp&#0183&#32I am getting low compressive strengths for my C40 concrete.i use cubes to test the strengths.my 3day M Pa is 30 but this is using 600kg m3 of cement.to me this is a bad result.I should be acheiving that strength using about 400kg m3 of cement.My w c ratio is very low.32.35.I cant figure out what could be wrong.The Effect of Styrofoam Artificial Lightweight AggregateTherefore,the SCC using the artificial lightweight aggregate (ALWA) is one of the solutions to reduce the selfweight (dead load) of a structure.This research was conducted to investigate the impact of the use of ALWA in conventional concrete and SCC in terms of its compressive strength and modulus of elasticity.
