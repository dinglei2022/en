## Why gypsum is added to cement answers
They add the gypsum to speed setting time.If it's not in there the cement will set slowerwhich,in some cases,is a good thingbut otherwise it won't affect the final product.3.6 Mineral and Oxide Composition of Portland Cement1) If the oxide composition is for a cement (i.e.clinker ground with gypsum),subtract the contribution of gypsum from the oxide composition.As an example,assume that 2 wt% gypsum (C H 2) was added to the clinker to make the cement.
