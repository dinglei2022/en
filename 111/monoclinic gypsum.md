Gypsum.Gypsum is a mineral found in crystal as well as masses called gypsum rock.It is a very soft mineral and it can form very pretty,and sometimes extremely large colored crystals.Massive gypsum rock forms within layers of sedimentary rock,typically found in thick beds or layers.Monoclinic crystal system Wikipedia20191010&ensp&#0183&enspIn the monoclinic system there is a rarely used second choice of crystal axes that results in a unit cell with the shape of an oblique rhombic prism it can be constructed because the rectangular twodimensional base layer can also be described with rhombic axes.In this axis setting,the primitive and basecentered lattices swap in centering type.
