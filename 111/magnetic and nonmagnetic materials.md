## Magnetic and non magnetic materials Everything Maths…
Magnetic and non magnetic materials.We have now looked at a number of ways in which matter can be grouped,such as into metals,semi metals andEmerging magnetism on vibrating non magnetic layersA research team,affiliated with UNIST has recently demonstrated the possibility to induce and control a magnetic response in a nonmagnetic layer material though selective excitation of specific vibration of the material,using state of the art theoretical simulation tools.
