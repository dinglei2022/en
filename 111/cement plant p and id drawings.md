## P&ID Symbols and Notation Lucidchart
Like other specialized diagrams,P&ID's are comprised of standard shapes and symbols There's a huge variety of symbols,depending on industry and manufacturer,so we've created this guide to feature the most popular P&ID symbols supported within our P&ID software and is standardized for best practice across the industryMaxPNS is a new numbering system for process plants There are more basic ideas of PNS: To create a numbering system where the machine numbers themselves contain enough information to enable communication with the various devices by means of fieldbus systems and especially the fieldbus system Max i It shall not be necessary with separate fieldbus.
