## Hydrocyclone Systems
A hydrocyclone is a static device that applies centrifugal force to a liquid mixture so as to promote the separation of heavy and light components.In Hydrocyclones,also known as liquid cyclones,the principle employed is centrifugal sedimentation,i.e.the particles.HeadCell Hydro InternationalRemove more,finer grit to protect downstream treatment equipment,increase plant efficiency and cut maintenance and repair costs.The HeadCell &#174; is a stacked tray grit,sand and solids separator that captures and retains 95% of all wastewater grit 75 micron (&#181;m) and larger.
