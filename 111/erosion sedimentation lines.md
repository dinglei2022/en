## Land Development &gt Erosion control
The City of Charlotte's Erosion Control Program originated from a state action,which granted local government authority to enforce the Sedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973 and specifically the erosion control requirements.The City of Charlotte Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance adopted in 1976 and revised in 2002 provides the framework and guidelines for protectingControlling Sediment and Erosion on Construction SitesJun 25,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Controlling sediment and erosion problems are critical to an effective storm water pollution prevention plan,or SWPPP.In addition,controlling runoff water helps to reduce erosion and sediment problems and ultimately reduces the environmental impact of a project.Best management for soil and erosion control during construction are outlined in the U.S.EPA's SWPPP.

## Erosion and Sedimentation river,important,types
Sedimentation is the process in which particulate matter carried from its point of origin by either natural or humanenhanced processes is deposited elsewhere on land surfaces or in waterbodies.Sediment is a natural product of stream erosion however,the sediment load may be increased by human practices.Publiions International Erosion Control AssociationIECA are proud to publish Best Practice Erosion and Sediment Control.This publiion has had a long gestation.Its origin lies in the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control,Engineering Guidelines for Queensland Construction Sites published by the then Institution of Engineers,Australia back in 1996.
