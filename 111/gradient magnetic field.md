## Maxwell coil Wikipedia
A Maxwell coil is a device for producing a large volume of almost constant (or constant gradient) magnetic field.It is named in honour of the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell.A Maxwell coil is an improvement of a Helmholtz coil: in operation it provides an even more uniform magnetic field (than a Helmholtz coil),but at the expense of more material and complexity.Magnetic Vector Potential Georgia State UniversityMagnetic Vector Potential.The electric field E can always be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential function.There is no general scalar potential for magnetic field B but it can be expressed as the curl of a vector function.
