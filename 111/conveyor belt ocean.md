## Oceanic Conveyor Belt Background Ocean Motion
The global oceanic conveyer belt (shown above in a simplified illustration),is a unifying concept that connects the ocean's surface and thermohaline (deep mass) circulation regimes,transporting heat and salt on a planetary scale.The conveyor belt system can be thought of as beginning near Greenland and Iceland in the North Atlantic where dry,cold winds blowing from northern Canada chillMelting Arctic Sea Ice and the Global Ocean Conveyor.Melting Arctic Sea Ice and the Global Ocean Conveyor Seawater moves through the Atlantic as part of the Global Ocean Conveyor,the regular pattern by which seawater travels the world’s oceans.The water in the Global Ocean Conveyor circulates because of differences in water density.
