## Granular Media Filtration for Water Treatment Applications
1 Granular Media Filtration for Water Treatment Applications Terry Engelhardt Sales Development Manager Drinking Water Hach Company The intent of this paper is to provide cursory information about filter design andTroubleshooting Pressure Sand Filters New HampshireTroubleshooting Pressure Sand Filters PROBLEM CAUSE SOLUTION Pool water is not clear or clean 1.Too frequent of a backwash cycle.Backwash according to pressure and not time.See manufacture's I O instructions for proper pressure differential (usually 710 psi above starting pressure).2.Freeboard not sufficient or improper
