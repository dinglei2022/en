Separation of salt,sawdust and iron can be accomplished by different techniques.One method uses magnetic attraction to separate the iron.Then,water is added to dissolve the salt while floating the sawdust.Skim off or use a filter to capture the sawdust and use evaporation to reclaim the salt.How to separte iron filings,sand,salt,iodine and waterJan 13,2007&nbsp&#0183&#32Then,you can use a magnet to separate the sand from the iron.You're going to have a problem with separating the iodine.Specifically,the problem is that you havent specified what type of iodine compound it is.If it&quots solid elemental iodine then it would have come out of the mixture with the iron filings and the sand.

## Discussion and Conclusion seperation of a mixture
For example,when separating the iron,salt,and sand mixture we were able to use a magnet to remove the majority of the iron from the mixture.This form of physical separation works because even though the components are mixed together,they retain their own characteristics,so iron remained magnetic even though it was a part of the mixture.Separation of Sand,Iron,and Salt Department of ChemistryThe three components are shown in their pure states,then combined into the water to form a heterogeneous mixture.The salt dissolves,the other solids do not.Using the fact that the iron is magnetic,the magnet can be used to separate the iron fillings from the mixture by moving teh magnet around in the container.

## Magnetic separation Wikipedia
Magnetic Separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using magnets to attract magnetic materials.The process that is used for magnetic separation detaches nonmagnetic material with those who are magnetic.This technique is useful for not all,but few minerals such as ferromagnetic (materials strongly affected by magnetic fields) and paramagnetic (materials that are lessProcedure seperation of a mixtureSeparation of a Mixture (Physical) PROCEDURE (PART A): Using a scoopula,put a small amount of salt,sand,and iron filings into 3 plastic dishes.Record the physical appearances of the substances.Place the magnet in a plastic bag,making sure no area of the magnet is exposed,and gently move around the three substances to test magnetism.
