Carbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.Introduced in the early 1980s,Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process.As such it is used in most industrial appliions where the presence of competing silver or copper does not prohibit its use.Gold CIL &amp; CIP Gold Leaching Process Explained CCD2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The gold cyanide complex is then extracted from the pulp or slurry by adsorption onto activated carbon.CIL stands for carbon in leach.This is a gold extraction process called cyanidation where carbon is added to the leach tanks (or reaction vessel) so that leaching and adsorption take place in the same tanks.

Leaching is the process by which constituents of a solid material are released into a contacting water phase.Although some species may be more of an environmental concern than others,the leaching process is indiscriminant such that all constituents (e.g.major or minor matrix components as well as inorganic,organic and radionuclide contaminants) are released under a common set of chemical.Gold CIP,CIL System,Heap Leaching,Cyanidation …Carbon leaching process is characterized by simultaneous gold leaching and adsorption stages,with normal leaching segments of 10 segments.In the leaching process,ensure the fineness of grinding products 200 mesh accounted for 95%,the pulp concentration accounts for 45%,then add a certain volume of CNLITE ECO gold leaching agent.

## Estimated Water Requirements for Gold HeapLeach
Ore Leaching Process Gold recovery using the heapleach method is based on the process of applying a leachate that usually contains about 100 to 600 parts per million (ppm) (0.01 to 0.06 percent) NaCN in a waterbased solution to a large pile of crushed or runofmine rock and,occasionally,mill tailings (Hoye,1987 vanGold Leaching Carbon in Leach18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Gold Leaching( carbon in leach) process is widely used in the newly built gold leaching plants in recent years,and a lot of plants are changing into CIL as well.Gold Leaching CIL process is suitable for the treatment of oxidized gold ore with low sulfur content and mud content.It is unsuitable for the gold ore with high grade silver.
