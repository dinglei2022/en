Heap leaching is a simple,lowcost method of recovering precious metals from lowgrade ores.Ore is stacked in heaps over an impermeable leachingpad.Leach liquid is irrigated at the top Liquid reacts with metal and dissolves it.Dissolved metal collected at the bottom in the leaching pad.Gold Heap Leaching Process xinhaiepcHeap leaching (HL) is a flexible and economic mineral processing method,commonly used to extract gold from lowgrade gold ores.In this process,ore is firstly crushed to fine particles.By spraying leaching solution to the large piles,the goldcontaining solution is leached.
