## Best Bass Drum Pedal Reviews of Single and Double Bass
Jan 04,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32Best Single Bass Drum Pedal: The Bass Drum pedal is perhaps the most important piece of hardware for any drummer.A strong kick drum is the heartbeat of every groove,and a good pedal will make it easy to maintain consistency of each stoke.There are three main types of pedals including chain driven,strap,and direct drive.Amazon: Trick Drums Pro 1V Bigfoot Double PedalThe pedal stays in place by using the feet of the kick drum to keep them from sliding forward,and putting velcro under the heel to keep them from sliding side to side.I personally don't like the bass drum clamp it's a spring loaded lever with no way to adjust the tension.
