## Metals and Ores ~ Learning Geology
Ore minerals do not occur uniformly through rocks of the crust.If they did,we would not be able to extract them economically.Fortunately for humanity,geologic processes concentrate these minerals into accumulations called ore deposits.Simply put,an ore deposit is an economically signiﬁcant occurrence of ore.Effectiveness Of Gravity Concentration For The20131224&ensp&#0183&enspThe mineralogical characterization of Itakpe iron ore shows that it contains mainly hematite,magnetite and quartz whose specific gravities give sound basis for adopting the gravity concentration technique.In this study,the effectiveness of gravity techniques for concentrating iron ore from bulk Itakpe (Nigeria) iron ore was studied
