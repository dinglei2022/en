The microstructural development of fired clays has been the subject of several recent studies.Brindley et al.[12] suggested that the transformation from kaolinite to mullite can be described by the followingKaolinite properties,structure and influence of metal.The kaolinite characterization test results are summarized in Table 1.The high concentration of Fe,which makes up about 0.125% by weight of the kaolinite,may be due to contamination of the kaolinite with illite.

## Introduction to Clay Minerals & Soils
Like the micas,clay minerals are shaped like flakes with irregular edges and one smooth side.There are many types of known clay minerals.Some of the more common types and their economic uses are described here: Kaolinite: This clay mineral is the weathering product of feldspars.It has a white,powdery appearance.CiteSeerX — Diagenetic development of kaoliniteCiteSeerX Document Details (Isaac Councill,Lee Giles,Pradeep Teregowda): Abstract Experimental solubility data for gibbsite and kaolinite are reviewed and applied to the pro blem of gibbsite stability within the natural environment.I is concluded that free alumina compounds formed (only) in lateritic soils will tend to silicify spontaneously in all sedimentary environments.
