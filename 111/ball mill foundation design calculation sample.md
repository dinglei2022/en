## Bond Ball Mill Index Test JKTech
The Bond Ball Mill Work Index can be used in the design calculations and simulations using JKSimMet of a new grinding circuit.A Bond Ball Mill Work Index may also be used in the simulation and optimisation of existing mill(s) and the associated grinding circuit(s).Sample Requirements: A minimum ofGrinding Mill Foundations&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;A mill vendor is experienced in mill design and generally knows nothing about ring motors or foundations.A geared mill does not require a torsional analysis.Wrong for several reasons but for this post,the torsional harmonics can be greater than the dynamic loads of tooth mesh,mill and pinion rotation and liner loads.
