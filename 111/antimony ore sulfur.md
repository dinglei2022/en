Antimony is chalcophile,occurring with sulfur and the heavy metals,lead,copper,and silver.Over a hundred minerals of antimony are found in nature.Stibnite (Sb2S3) is the predominant ore mineral of antimony.Process for preparing high purity antimony trichloride …16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Antimony sulfide contained in an antimony sulfide bearing ore,such as stibnite,is converted to high purity antimony trichloride by reacting the antimony sulfide bearing ore with a source of chlorine to form high purity antimony trichloride and sulfur or hydrogen sulfide as separable by products.

METALLURGY.LIQUATION: Liquation is the melting of stibnite into “crudum” or “needle antimony”.It is carried out between 550 and 600 degrees C.If the temperature is lower,the recovery is poor.If the temperature is any higher,the stibnite volatilizes into oxide.This method is used to upgrade low grade ores.The ore is placed on a.Leaching kinetics of antimony bearing complex sulfides ore in.…Key words: ozone; antimony bearing complex sulfides ore;.meaning that the sulfur in ore was transformed into.Treating low grade antimony ore by bath smelting.
