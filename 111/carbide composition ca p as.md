## US7875545B2 Siliconrich nickelsilicide ohmic contacts
A method of producing an ohmic contact and a resulting ohmic contact structure are disclosed.The method includes the steps of forming a deposited film of nickel and silicon on a silicon carbide surface at a temperature below which either element will react with silicon carbide and in respective proportions so that the atomic fraction of silicon in the deposited film is greater than the atomicCarbide chemical compound BritannicaCarbide,any of a class of chemical compounds in which carbon is combined with a metallic or semimetallic element.Calcium carbide is important chiefly as a source of acetylene and other chemicals,whereas the carbides of silicon,tungsten,and several other elements are valued for their physical hardness,strength,and resistance to chemical attack even at very high temperatures.

Carbide round blanks are typically ground into solid carbide cutting tools.The composition of carbide can be varied to change the material characteristics as desired for different appliions.The three main variables are the tungsten carbide powder grain size,the amount of tungsten carbide powder and the amount of cobalt.Calcium Carbide Appliions Carbide Industries LLCCalcium carbide is converted into acetylene in a controlled reaction with water using an apparatus called a generator.Acetylene,which has the chemical formula C2H2,is an extremely useful hydrocarbon due to the energy that is locked up in the triplebond between the carbon atoms.
