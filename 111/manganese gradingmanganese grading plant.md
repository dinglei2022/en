## Epsom Salts: a natural hack to grow healthy cannabis plants
Apr 13,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Epsom salt is a fantastic and completely natural way of giving your cannabis plant an extra boost of both magnesium and sulphur,with the added benefit that you really can't go very wrong with it.Excess feeding of these micronutrients will not have a negative effect on your plants.It is almost impossible to oversaturate the soil over time.How to Add Boron to the Vegetable Garden HunkerSome vegetables prefer more of this micronutrient than other plants require,but adding boron to your vegetable garden demands great care.The range where boron helps plant growth is narrow.Too little boron causes poor vegetable production,but even slightly too much of this common element can leave soil toxic to all plant life.
