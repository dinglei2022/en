Crusher A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks &amp; lumps into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.Crushing Principles of Mechanical CrushingCrusher Yield Inco Optimization of a Final Crushing Stage • What difference does it make? • Running the crusher 0.08’’ off: Decrease the profit by 58.5 $ h Running the crusher at 1600 hours per year: 58.5*1600=$93600 Planning Sampling Analysis0 500
