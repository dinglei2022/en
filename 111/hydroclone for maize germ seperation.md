20161025&ensp&#0183&enspwith soaking the maize kernels in water,in a process known as steeping.Once the kernels are softened,the germ is separated after milling in hydrocylones and screens.After the germ has been removed,the fibre fraction is then separated and washed using screens.The germ is subsequently pressed to produce maize oil for human consumption.Corn oil production process Edible Oil Expeller MachineryThe process of corn oil extraction includes the separation of embryos and the extraction of embryos.1.Separation of embryos.The separation of corn germ mainly consists of dry desquamation and wet grinding.Dry desquamation and embryo preparation means that the raw material is directly desquamated and embryo preparation without water treatment.
