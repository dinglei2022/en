## Optimization of Cement Grinding Operation in Ball Mills
Desired progress of grinding is clearly visible in the graphs.Fig 2.Analysis of longitudinal samples.Use of suitable grinding aids also is recommended to improve grinding.However,it is important to mention that grinding aids should not be considered as optimization tools.Patent US20120270972 Cement grinding aid Google Patents25 Oct 2012.The fineness of the cement is therefore an important quality feature.In order to facilitate the comminution to powder form,so called cement grinding aids are used.This greatly reduces the grinding times and energy costs.Such cement grinding aids are typically selected from the class comprising glycols&nbsp;.
