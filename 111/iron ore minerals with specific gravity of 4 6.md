## Goethite Wikipedia
Goethite is an iron oxyhydroxide containing ferric iron.It is the main component of rust and bog iron ore.Goethite's hardness ranges from 5.0 to 5.5 on the Mohs Scale,and its specific gravity varies from 3.3 to 4.3.The mineral forms prismatic needlelike crystals (&quotneedle iron ore&quot) but is more typically massive.Mineralresources Trading &amp ServicesAbout Mineral Resources.Mineral Resources Trading &amp Services is one of the leading mining and trading company of Pakistan.Mineral Resources Trading &amp Services was incorporated in the year 2010 as an exporter of various sorts of minerals from Pakistan and other countries.

## Pyrite Mineral Uses and Properties
Identifying Pyrite.Hand specimens of pyrite are usually easy to identify.The mineral always has a brassyellow color,a metallic luster and a high specific gravity.It is harder than other yellow metallic minerals,and its streak is black,usually with a tinge of green.It often occurs in wellformed crystals in the shape of cubes,octahedrons,or pyritohedrons,which often have striated faces.lelation Between Specific ravity and Iron Content USGSThe use of specific gravity in determining the grade of iron ore is not a new procedure.Eckel (1910,p.38) pointed out the approxi&#173 mate correlation between specific gravity of the Alabama iron ores and their iron content.Feld,Coe,and Coghill (1946) devised a rapid specificgravity method for estimating the iron content of powdered

## How do you find the specific gravity of a mineral
To determine the specific gravity of a mineral,you simply take a sample of ore of known size and put it into a volume of water.Weigh the water that was displaced by the mineral.This will give you the ratio between the mineral and the water.Magneticgravity separation of iron ore NISCAIRMagneticgravity separation of iron ore P A Usachyov &amp S Yu Korytny Mining Institute,Kola Science Centre,Russian Academy of Sciences,24 Fersman str.184200 Apatity,Munnansk region,Russia Received 17 October 1997 accepted 30 April 199'S In order to produce highgrade ironore concentrates a magneticgravity method has been developed
