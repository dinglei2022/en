## Limestone Aggregate Production — Melgaard Construction
Limestone is an important source of construction aggregate due to its strength,versatility,and low thermal expansion.At Melgaard Construction,we operate limestone quarries to perform our own crushing and grading to achieve the ideal aggregate mix in the quantity required for all our projects.Effects of limestone crusher dust and steel fibers onIn order to use the (limestone) crusher dust as filler material in cement,the minimum amount of CaCO 3 is specified to be 75% by mass according to BS EN 1971.Crushed rock acts as filler and helps to reduce the total voids content in concrete.Consequently,this contributes to improve the quality of

## LIMESTONE CRUSHERRUN AND TAILINGS IN COMPACTION CONCRETE
Laboratory experiments indies that both limestone crusherrun and finely grained limestone tailings (byproducts of the aggregate mining industry) can be used in concrete made with a emerging technology for flatwork construction known as roller compacted concrete (RCC).The Strength of Marble and Granite Seattle Granite MarbleMarble is limestone that has been compacted and heated over millions of years.As a result,marble is less porous and slightly stronger than limestone,but still less durable than granite.Depending on the limestone and the mineral combination within the marble,most marble rates from three to five on the Mohs hardness scale.
