## Abrasive Wikipedia
An abrasive is a material,often a mineral,that is used to shape or finish a workpiece through rubbing which leads to part of the workpiece being worn away by friction.While finishing a material often means polishing it to gain a smooth,reflective surface,the process can also involve roughening as in satin,matte or beaded finishes.In.Abrasive Processes brainkart.comAbrasive Processes.Abrasive machining processes can be divided into two categories based on how the grains are applied to the workpiece.In bonded abrasive processes,the particles are held together within a matrix,and their combined shape determines the geometry of the finished workpiece.
