During the froth flotation process,occurs the separation of several types of sulfides,carbonates and oxides,prior to further refinement.Phosphates and coal can also be purified by flotation technology.During the process,four things happen: Reagent conditioning happens in order to achieve hydrophobic surface charges on the desiredFroth Flotation Method Gold and Silver Ore FlotationDec 20,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32The Froth Flotation Method is means separating minerals according to their different physical and chemical properties.According to classifiion,the flotability of gold and silver minerals is included in the first egory of natural and nonferrous heavy metal sulfides,characterized by low surface wettability and easy flotation,which can be flotation by xanthate collectors.

## Flotation Device,Froth Flotation,Flotation System
Introduction: Flotation separation process is one of the most widely mineral processing method used in the production.It uses the difference of physical and chemical properties in mineral surface,and rely on air bubbles buoyancy in the pulp to realize mineral separation process.
