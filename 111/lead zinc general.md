## Sasa Central Asia Metals
Sasa is an underground zinc and lead mine that produces approximately 800,000 tonnes of ore each year.Accessed by adit,the Svinja Reka deposit is mined using a sublevel caving method,which utilises the geotechnical characteristics of the weak hanging wall to allow the rock to cave naturally into the void remaining after ore has been blasted.Zinc and Lead glencore20191026&ensp&#0183&enspWe mine and process zinc and lead ores in the key mining regions of Australia,South America,Kazakhstan and Canada.And,we smelt and refine zinc and lead at processing operations in Australia,Canada,Spain,Italy,Germany,the UK and Kazakhstan.We also source and recycle zinc and lead materials in Europe and North America.

## Uses of Zinc Supply,Demand,Production,Resources
Zinc is commonly found in mineral deposits along with other base metals,such as copper and lead.Zinc deposits are broadly classified on the basis of how they are formed.Zinc is produced mainly from three types of deposits: sedimentary exhalative (Sedex),Mississippi Valley type (MVT),and volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS).Membership ZINC.International Zinc AssociationThe International Zinc Association (IZA) is the only organization dedied exclusively to the interests of zinc and its users.IZA provides a forum for the zinc industry to analyze and anticipate issues affecting zinc globally and to ensure a timely and appropriate response.
