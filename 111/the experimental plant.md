## Cleve Backster Wikipedia
Grover Cleveland &quotCleve&quot Backster Jr.(February 27,1924 June 24,2013) was an interrogation specialist for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),best known for his experiments with plants using a polygraph instrument in the 1960s which led to his theory of &quotprimary perception&quot where he claimed that plants &quotfeel pain&quot and have extrasensory perception (ESP),which was widely reported inThoughts on the experimental plant? (Slight spoilers) : fo4Spoiler Thoughts on the experimental plant? there is a terminal that you can read and it documents the former head botany researcher and how they did experiments on a small root found near water I think it is an Elder Scrolls easter egg due to they plant being named Glowleaf by the scribe and the general similarity it has with Nirnroot.
