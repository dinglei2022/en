## Nuclear pulse propulsion Wikipedia
Nuclear pulse propulsion or external pulsed plasma propulsion is a hypothetical method of spacecraft propulsion that uses nuclear explosions for thrust.It was first developed as Project Orion by DARPA,after a suggestion by Stanislaw Ulam in 1947.Newer designs using inertial confinement fusion have been the baseline for most postOrion designs,including Project Daedalus and Project Longshot.Types Of Nuclear Reactors nuclearenergy.netThe thermal energy generated by nuclear fission chain reactions is used to boil the water.The steam produced is introduced into a turbine that drives an electric generator.The steam that leaves the turbine passes through a condenser,where it is transformed back into liquid water.Later it returns to the nuclear reactor driven by a suitable pump.
