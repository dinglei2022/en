## Improvement of thiosulfate stability in gold leaching
Ammonium thiosulfate is a noncyanide lixiviant for gold leaching.However,the major problem with this leaching method has been the high consumption of reagents.To leach a mildrefractory copperbearing gold ore,the authors used a reagent combination of 0.3M (NH 4) 2 S 2 O 3,0.03M CuSO 4 and 3M NH 3 at pH 10.2 for 24 hours.In the testingextraction of gold by leaching process oalebakkershoesBasement Chemistry for the Prospector Cyanide Leaching.The first chemical leaching of gold occurred in the late 1800's with the introduction on the market of &quotDuPont Mining Salts&quot.for most purposes,it is still the preferred method of gold extraction and by the fact
