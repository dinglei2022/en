## Oil and the Environment Energy Explained,Your Guide To
Although petroleum products make life easier,finding,producing,and moving crude oil may have negative effects on the environment.Technological advances in exploration,production,and transportation of oil and enforcement of safety and environmental laws and regulations help to avoid and reduce these effects.Environmental Risks of Mining Massachusetts Institute ofOpen pit mining,where material is excavated from an open pit,is one of the most common forms of mining for strategic minerals.This type of mining is particularly damaging to the environment because strategic minerals are often only available in small concentrations,which increases the amount of ore needed to be mined.

## 6 Potential Environmental Effects of Uranium Mining
â€¢ Significant potential environmental risks are associated with extreme natural events and failures in management practices.Extreme natural events (e.g.hurricanes,earthquakes,intense rainfall events,drought) have the potential to lead to the release of contaminants if facilities are not designed and constructed to withstand such events,or fail to perform as designed.Apocalyptic Facts About How Mining Affects the EnvironmentFeb 07,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Mining refers to the process of extracting metals and minerals from the earth.Gold,silver,diamond,iron,coal,and uranium are just a few of the vast array of metals and minerals that are obtained by this process.Mining activities require the clearing of large areas of land.The chemicals used in the mining process often escape into the environment causing largescale pollution.

## Environmental Hazards of Limestone Mining Sciencing
However,underground limestone mines can be found in the central and eastern United States,especially near cities.In humid climates,limestone dissolves quickly and is carried away by water.This creates caves which can become weak and collapse.Underground mining of limestone can cause a cascading environmental impact.
