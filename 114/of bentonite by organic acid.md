Summary.The adsorption from suspension of the humic and fulvicacid components of a soil organicmatter extract by bentonite was extremely rapid,and was unaffected by temperature.For the humic fraction the extent of adsorption was : Ca and Mg systems &gt acid systems &gt K and Na systems for the fulvic fraction: acid &gt.Retention of Organic Matter Contained in Industrial Phosphoric AcidSep 16,2013 Abstract.Purifiion of industrial phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is considered a major problem and several methods have been evaluated.In this study,two different types of clay,raw bentonite clay (RBC) and raw grey clay (RGC),were used for removal of SOM contained in H3PO4 at low pH.The used samples
