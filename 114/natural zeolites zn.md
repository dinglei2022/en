## Effects of Natural Zeolites on Bioavailability and
The bioavailability and leachability of heavy metals play an important role in the toxicity of heavy metals in the final compost followed by land appliion.This chapter examines the effects of natural zeolite on bioavailability of heavy metals (Zn,Cu,Mn,Fe,Ni,Pb,Cd,and Cr) in the form of water soluble and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) extractable.Water Treatment KMI ZeoliteAmmonia (NH3) and heavy metal ions are often found in water sources and pose serious health and environmental risks.Studies have determined that natural clinoptilolite zeolite is selective for these ions,meaning that it will absorb and bind them in its honeycomb structure even in the presence of larger amounts of competing ions.

## Zeolite Wikipedia
Zeolites are microporous,aluminosilie minerals commonly used as commercial adsorbents and alysts.The term zeolite was originally coined in 1756 by Swedish mineralogist Axel Fredrik Cronstedt,who observed that rapidly heating the material,believed to have been stilbite,produced large amounts of steam from water that had been adsorbed by the material.A Mass Transfer Analysis of Competitive Binding of Pb,CdAbstract: The lowcost natural zeolite clinoptilolite was successfully applied for the competitive removal of Pb,Cd,and Zn from binary (Pb + Zn) and (Cd + Zn) aqueous solutions at different Pb Zn and Cd Zn concentration ratios.The obtained efficiency was in the range of 79.0 85.0%,and was similar for both
