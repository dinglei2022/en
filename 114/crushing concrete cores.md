If any strength test of laboratorycured cylinders falls below the specified compressive strength by more than 500 psi (or by more than 0.10 times the specified strength for specified strengths greater than 5000 psi),ACI 31808,"Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete," requires that steps shall be taken to assureHow to test PSI strength of concrete core samples.YouTubeOct 26,2010 This video shows Phoenix Home Services,a local contractor of Washington DC and Northern Virginia,explaining how to test concrete strength with a press designed to test the PSI of concrete.In this video a 3000 psi concrete core is tested.At the 5 day mark the core test was almost to the 3000 psi mark.

Incorrect measurement of the in situ strength of concrete by crushing extracted cores has serious economic and legal impliions.Recent experience has shown an alarming spread of results when cores from a single structure were capped and tested by different laboratories using different procedures.In South Africa,theCorrection Factors for Core Strengths Concrete ConstructionFeb 1,1983 When the testing laboratory broke some cores they calculated the strength in psi by dividing the load by the average crosssectional area.Then they multiplied the result by a &quotstrength correction factor&quot that gave a lower value.Where did this correction.
