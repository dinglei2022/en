## Carbon in pulp Wikipedia
Carbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.Introduced in the early 1980s,Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process.As such it is used in most industrial appliions where the presence ofEffect of Metal Impurities on Adsorption of Gold by Activated CarbonOct 3,1989 investigated the effect that metal impurities,present in cyanide leach solutions,have on the adsorption of gold by activated carbon.The metals used in the survey were typically associated with complex ore deposits of the.Western United States and included antimony,arsenic,cadmium,calcium,cobalt,iron

## Gold CIL & CIP Gold Leaching Process Explained CCD
Mar 17,2017 Cyanide is a lixiviant,or reagent that is used to leach,often in tanks,gold from a solid matrix and form a gold cyanide complex.The gold cyanide complex is then extracted from the pulp or slurry by adsorption onto activated carbon.CIL stands for carboninleach.This is a gold extraction process calledMeasuring pH in Cyanide Leaching Emersonsodium cyanide solution.The heap leaching solution continuously flows over the ore and may be collected and stored in a pond.The gold cyanide is typically separated from the pregnant liquor using carbon adsorption beds.The activated carbon adsorbs the gold cyanide complex on the surface of the carbon particles.
