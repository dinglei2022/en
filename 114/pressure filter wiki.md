## Filtration Wikipedia
Fluids flow through a filter due to a difference in pressure—fluid flows from the highpressure side to the lowpressure side of the filter,leaving some material behind.The simplest method to achieve this is by gravity and can be seen in the coffeemaker example.In the laboratory,pressure in the form of compressed air on theOil pump (internal combustion engine)Oil pressure The oil pressure generated in most engines should be about 10 psi per every 1000 revolutions per minute (rpm),peaking around 65 psi.Local pressure (at the crankshaft journal and bearing) is far higher than the 50,60 psi &amp;c.set by the pump's relief.

The filter uses a pneumatic airbag to keep an upper and lower platten together with a liquid tight seal while solid bearing liquid is pumped through the filter media.Once the pressure inside the filter has reached 40 psi,pressurized air is fed into the upper platten,forcing the remaining liquid through the filter media leaving a dry cake.Pressure regulatorsPressure regulators work according to one of two main functional principles: the directly actuated diaphragm regulator and the pilot actuated piston regulator.Directly actuated diaphragm control valves On these regulators,the main spring exerts a force on a This.
