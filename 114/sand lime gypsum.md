## Lime (material) Wikipedia
An example is when slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) is mixed into a thick slurry with sand and water to form mortar for building purposes.When the masonry has been laid,the slaked lime in the mortar slowly begins to react with carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate (limestone) according to the reaction: Ca(OH)2 + CO2Experimental Studies on Fly Ash Sand Lime Bricks with,Banu et al (2013) concluded that at the optimum composition 55% of fly ash with sand,lime and gypsum,bricks exhibited no shrinkage and water absorption observed as 1158% If brick forming.
