## Iron ore Wikipedia
Lower grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation,using techniques like crushing,milling,gravity or heavy media separation,screening,and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities.The results,high quality fine ore powders,are known as fines.Magnetite.Magnetite is magnetic,and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and.
