A change in the general price level will change the quantity supplied of the domestic output,this is a change along the AS curve.Other economic variables will change the SRAS curve and shift the curve to a new position.Some of these factors are listed below: 1.The Wage Rate: Higher wage rates means higher labor cost.Factors That Cause Shifts in the Supply CurveThe law of supply states that higher the price,the higher the quantity supplied,for higher prices mean more revenues.However,other factors also influence supply,and such factors may cause a shift in the supply curve,right or left,even when prices remain constant.
