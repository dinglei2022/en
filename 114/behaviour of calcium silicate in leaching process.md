Dec 27,2017 Calcium leaching is a degradation process consisting in progressive dissolution of the cement paste by migration of calcium atoms to the aggressive solution.It is therefore,a complex phenomenon involving several phases and dissolution and diffusion processes simultaneously.Along this work,a newFracture Mechanics of Concrete Structures,de Borst et alFigure 2: Triaxial Strength Domain of calcium leached cement paste (w c 0.5).resentative of the 'real' Calcium leaching process,to which the material and structure will be sub&#173 jected during its service life.This highlights the ex&#173 perimental difficulty of assessing the material per&#173 formance of partially degraded material samples.

## Steelmaking Slags in Acetic Acid for Precipitated Calcium
producing calcium carbonate from calcium silies is the acetic acid carbonation process suggested and studied by Kakizawa et al.[3].The process consists of two main steps,where the reactions occur (Fig.1).First,calcium ions are extracted from a natural calcium silie mineral by leaching in acetic acid (CH 3COOH): CaSiO 3 &#254 2CH 3COOHAluminum Mineral Processing and Metallurgy: IronRichHowever,the hightemperature reduction,smelting and alkaline leaching process is a feasible method to recover iron and alumina from ironrich bauxite and red mud.Due to the simple process,low cost,it is worth promoting its appliion in the field of iron and steel industry and aluminum industry.

## Leaching Behaviour of Heavy Metals from the Class C Fly
In this paper,leaching behavior of heavy metals from the class C fly ash (CFA)based geopolymers were studied.The CFAbased geopolymers were prepared from CFA,flue gas desulfurization gypsum (FGDG),and water treatment residual (WTR).The extractionleaching concentrations of heavy metals from CFAbased geopolymers were lower than their maximum concentration limits according to theLeaching and Microstructural Analysis of CementBasedLeach tests alone cannot determine the actual performance and longterm environmental impacts of solidified stabilized waste because they do not provide information on the physical and chemical changes between waste and additives.This research study utilized a combined approach to investigate the leaching behaviors and binding chemistry of a solidified stabilized industrial waste.

## Hydration behaviors of calcium siliebased biomaterials
Calcium silie (CS)based biomaterials,such as mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA),have become the most popular and convincing material used in major phases of hydrated C3S are calcium silie hydrate (CSH) and calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2],which are produced as byproducts later during the hydration process.
