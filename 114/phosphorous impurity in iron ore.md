## Iron Ore
The aim of this work is to study carbon deposition of PKS in iron ore through reduction process.Utilization of carbon deposited in low grade iron ore is an interesting method for iron making process as this solid carbon can act as energy source in the reduction process.Blast Furnace7 Nov 2007.furnace,the calcium carbonate in limestone breaks down to form carbon dioxide and calcium oxide.The calcium oxide then reacts with the acidic impurities to form a molten liquid called slag.This is lighter than the molten iron,so it floats on top of the iron and can be tapped off When the slag cools,&nbsp;.
