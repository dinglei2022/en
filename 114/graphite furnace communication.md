## Graphite furnace atomic absorption Wikipedia
Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) is a type of spectrometry that uses a graphitecoated furnace to vaporize the sample.Briefly,the technique is based on the fact that free atoms will absorb light at frequencies or wavelengths characteristic of the element of interest (hence the name atomic absorptionAgilent Graphite Tube Atomizer GTA 120Contents.4.Agilent Graphite Tube Atomizer GTA 120 User&#39s Guide.3.Getting Started.23.GTA Control Unit.24.Front View.24.Back View.25.GTA Furnace.26.Water Supplies.26 All users of an AA (Atomic Absorption) and GTA (Graphite Tube.Atomizer) instrument.A communiions cable connects the GTA to the
