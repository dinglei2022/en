## Mechanical Engineering: Basics of Sand Moulding
The process is fairly straightforward: you make a pattern of what you want to cast,then use the pattern to make a sand mold,and then pour molten metal into the mold.BASIC MECHANICAL ENGINEERING ppt download SlidePlayera moulding material,pouring a molten metal in the cavity of the mould and withdrawing the solidified metal,called casting,from the mould.Depending up on the method of mould preparation or the pouring method of the metal the processes are variously designated as Sand moulding,Shell moulding or Die casting etc.
