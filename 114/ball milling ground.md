25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Laboratory scale ball milling (5−100 mL scale) is a batch process,whereas industrial ball mills can be operated in a continuous mode,thus oﬀering a very high synthesis throughput.The milling occurs due to mechanical friction between the grinding medium,such as balls of the same or various sizes,and the ground material (Figure 1).Horizontal Tube Ball Mill Shri BalajiIn case of continuously operated ball mill,the material to be ground is fed from the feed end left and the product is discharged through to the right discharge end.As the shell rotates,the balls are lifted up on the rising side of the shell and then they cascade down (or drop down on to the feed),from near the top of the shell.

## Ball milling in organic synthesis: solutions and challenges …
During the last decade numerous protocols have been published using the method of ball milling for synthesis all over the field of organic chemistry.However,compared to other methods leaving their marks on the road to sustainable synthesis (e.g.microwave,ultrasound,ionic liquids) chemistry in ball mills is rather underrepresented in the knowledge of organic chemists.Ballscrews Huntley,Illinois HIWIN CorporationThe Super T series circulation path has the elements leaving the ball track tangential to the PCD and coordinating with the lead angle of the ballscrew shafting.This optimal design not only reduces the noise level but also vibrations leading to smoother rotation.Miniature Ground Ballscrews
