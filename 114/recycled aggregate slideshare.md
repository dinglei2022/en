the recycled aggregate comes from many different sources,the uneven quality,ie variations in the properties of recycled aggregate are much more pro nounced than as is the case with natural aggregat Figure 2 Appearance of the recycled aggregate grains [2] 21 Aggregate grading Grading of recycled coarse aggregatestructures built of recycled aggregate concrete Bussa,recycled aggregate concrete slideshare Nov 15,2014 Its a lower density,elastic modulus,strength and a higher water absorption capacity recycled aggregate has a proportional mortar which attached to aggregate,it gives a higher porosity and a lower strength to RAC than the normal concrete
