These can be small particles of quartz,feldspar,clay minerals,pyrite,siderite,and other minerals.It can also contain large nodules of chert,pyrite,or siderite.The calcium carbonate content of limestone gives it a property that is often used in rock identifiion it effervesces in contact with a cold solution of 5% hydrochloricHow does weathering affect limestone?Limestone areas are predominantly affected by chemical weathering when rainwater,which contains a weak carbonic acid,reacts with limestone.This causes the limestone to dissolve.Carbon dioxide from the respiration of animals (and ourselves) is one cause of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
