## Gold Extraction from kaymaz gold ore by thiourea leaching
For over one hundred years,gold has traditionally been extracted from ores by cyanide leaching.In recent years,due to pressure by environmentalists and to certain disadvantages of the cyanidation process,investigations were directed towards alternative gold lixiviants.The most promising results in gold leaching wereReview of gold extraction from ores Request PDF ResearchGateDec 20,2017 Request (PDF) Review of gold extra Australia is now an important gold producer in the world.The nature of Australian gold production is briefly reviewed and the hydrometallurgy of gold extraction is considered.The choice of processing routes for free milling,complex and refractory ores is discussed.
