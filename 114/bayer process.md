The process was invented in 1888 by an Austrian,Karl Joseph Bayer.Bayer discovered that when bauxite was mixed with caustic soda,the alumina content in the bauxite would dissolve and separate itself from the other components,such as iron and silica,which would remain in solid state.The Surface Chemistry of Bayer Process Solids: A Review.Request (PDF) The Surface Chemistr. The Bayer process is used for refining bauxite to smelting grade alumina (Al 2 O 3),the precursor to aluminium.The process was developed and patented by Karl Josef Bayer 110 years ago,and has become the cornerstone of …
