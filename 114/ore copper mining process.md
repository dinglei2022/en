## Copper processing
Copper processing Copper processing Ores: Principal forms in which copper ores are found include native copper,porphyry copper,massive deposits,and mixed ores.Native copper is simply the metal found unadulterated in nature.Occasionally copper is still found in its native form,but more frequently it is mixed with other minerals,some of which may have value themselves.The amount of.Sulfide Mining and Voyageurs National ParkBut the lakes and rivers of Voyageurs National Park are now at risk from proposed sulfide mining projects in its watershed.There are numerous loions where mining corporations are exploring for copper,gold,and nickel.The process to extract these metals from sulfide ore deposits produces sulfuric acid and other
