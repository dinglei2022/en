## Cationic Exchanger with Activated Clay.Part I
Abstract.The preparation of an acidic ionic exchanger from a calcium bentonite is described.The behavior and properties of acidic montmorillonite and activated clay are given as well as the effect of thermal treatment and gamma irradiation on ionic exchange capacity and internal surface area.Sulphuric Acid Activation of a Calcium Bentonite: ParticulateJun 4,2010 The objective of this work was to determine the changes of thermal and surface properties of a bentonite from Çankιrι after activation using different concentrations of H2SO4 solutions (0.5 4 M).XRD,FTIR,DTA,and TG analyses of the samples were performed to examine the structural changes of the

## Thermal Activation of a Clayzic Catalyst Useful for Friedel Crafts
Depending upon the ZnCl2 loading and calcination temperatures,an appreciable amount of HCl is evolved in the thermal activation,indiing an occurrence of reaction between the ZnCl2 and the surface hydroxyl groups of the clay ( OH + ZnCl2→ O Zn Cl + HCl),leading to formation of new Lewis acid sites ( O ZnFluoride removal from water by adsorption on acid activatedof fluoride has been attempted using acid activated kaolinite clay obtained from local XRD data and thermal analysis.The clay was on the basal surface.It is generally assumed to be due to the substitution of aluminium for silicon in tetrahedral layer with a consequent imbalance of negative charge.The edges of crystal,
