Sep 9,2016 Crushing is performed in stages using a combination of jaw,cone and impact crushers and is performed dry.The material is moved by mechanical means with conveyor belts.Sometimes the blasting and crushing fines are washed off the ore,and pumped as a slurry directly to the grinding circuit.The upperTrack Crushers Rapid CrushingThe largest mobile circuit we operate is the Metso LT125 50" X 38" Track Jaw with the HP300 track cone.The smaller modules in a 2 or 3 stage configuration will crush up to 300 tonnes per hour.The larger modules crush up to 600 tonnes per hour.All trackmounted crushers and screens are selfpowered with inbuilt diesel
