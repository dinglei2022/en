The purpose of the VWS STREAMLINER™ deoiling hydrocyclone is to separate free oil from produced water prior to discharge or injection.Usually situated after the primary separators,deoiling hydrocyclones are normally regarded as the first stage in the treatment process.HYDROCYCLONES thermopediaBy elongating the cone and using narrow angles as small as 1&#176 to 2&#176 the shear zone is minimized relative to the non shear inner zone and finely dispersed oil in water can be separated down to a few tens of ppm.These special forms of hydrocyclone are now successfully marketed for removing oil from water in the Hydrocyclones,Holt
