## Stern Gerlach experiment Wikipedia
In the original experiment,silver atoms were sent through a spatially varying magnetic field,which deflected them before they struck a detector screen,such as a glass slide,the particles passing through the Stern Gerlach apparatus are deflected either up or down by a specific amount,the separation into distinct orbits was.Magnetic Separators MMUA W D P Buhler GroupMagnetic separators are suited for flaky and powdery products such as bran and flour,as well as for granular materials.High magnetizing force for the optimal separation of metal particles.The material stream is distributed evenly over the entire width of the apparatus and flows over a permanent magnet with a high magnetizing force.
