Commercial ball sizes 10 150 mm; Number,size and mass of each ball size depends on mill load and whether or not the media is being added as the initial charge.For the initial chargin of a mill,Coghill and DeVaney (1937) defined the ball size as a function of the toOptimum choice of the make up ball sizes for maximum.It was found that the optimum composition depends on various factors,including the feed size,the product size,the mill diameter and the breakage parameters.In all cases,binary mixtures of two ball sizes (50.8 mm and 25.4 mm) performed better than a mixture of the three ball sizes.
