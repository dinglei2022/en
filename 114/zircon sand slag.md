## Zircon : Tronox
Zircon.Zircon is separated from heavy mineral concentrate in the dry mill loed at Tronox&#39s Chandala operations.Zircon&#39s resistance to abrasion and high temperatures make it a key ingredient in a number of ceramic appliions,such as glazes used in tiles and sanitary ware.It is also used in refractory appliions toOur products Rio TintoOf this,95 per cent is exported,yielding a world market share of about 25 per cent of titanium feedstock (titania slag and rutile),33 per cent of the world&#39s zircon output and 25 per cent of the Zircon sand is also used in the foundry industry.Wave action deposits the sand containing the heavy minerals onto the beaches.
