## Relationships Between Bond&#39s Grindability (Gbg) and Breakage
ABSTRACT: The grindability of a material is the only factor used to determine the required size of a grinding machine.Although,Bond&#39s grindabilty test is widely used to the estimate power required of an industrial grinding mill.Recently,kinetic model has been mostly used to the design of grinding circuits.In this study,theCharacteristics of Mae Moh lignite: Hardgrove grindability index andPage 1 all samples can be classified as lignite with the Hargrove grindability indices ranging from about 40 to 50.However,there is a significant difference in the work indices With Hardgrove grindability indices and the work indices calculated from Aplan&#39s formula,capacity of the rollerrace pulverizer and grindability of
