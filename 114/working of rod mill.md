## Rod Mills,How Do They Work?
For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and broken and worn rods must be removed.Rod mills usually require greater operator attention.Bond Work Index TestsBond Rod Mill Grindability Test.Grinding Solutions can carry out Bond Rod Mill Work Index tests to determine the energy requirements for milling ore in a rod mill.The test requires a minimum of 20kg of 12.5mm material.Closing screen sizes typically range from 4.75mm

## Ball Mills vs Rod Mills
When the mill is rotated without feed or with very fine feed,the rods are in parallel alignment and in contact with one another for their full length.New feed entering at one end of the mill causes the rod charge to spread at that end.This produces a series of wedge shaped slots tapering toward the discharge end.The tumbling and rolling rods expend most of their crushing force on the.rod mill working principle Henan Deya Machinery Co.Ltd.Rod mills are normally run at between 50 and 65% of the critical speed,so that the rods cascade rather than cataract; many operating mills have been sped up to close t0 80% of critical speed without any reports of excessive wear.The feed pulp density is usually between 65 and 85u o solids by weight,finer feeds requiring lower pulp densities.

The capacities of larger mills are more sensitive to changes of reduction ratios.Working with eight rod mills of different sizes,ranging from 1.2 &#215; 2.4 m to 4.1 &#215; 5.7 m at two levels,Kurimoto confirmed this observation.Figure 8.7 shows that rod mill capacities varied inversely as the reduction ratio.DownDifference Between Sag Mill vs Ball Mill&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;SAG mill make use of steel balls included with some large and hard rocks for grinding.These mills utilize the balls in making the large fragments of materials broken into pieces.The ball charge of a SAG mill is about 9% to 20%.This process takes place inside the large rotating
