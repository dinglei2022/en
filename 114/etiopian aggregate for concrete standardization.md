## Ethiopia: Lightweight concrete made with Ethiopian pumice*
In their endeavours to produce lightweight concrete,producers are trying to replace part of the normal stone aggregates by natural lightweight aggregates.All trial mixes were made following a standardized procedure and the resulting proportions of materials were used for the final mixes.Test results are given in table 2.The Importance of Standardization of Aggregate in EthiopianEach truck of sand from the same place at different time may not be the same and it is difficult to design mix proportion for each truck of sand and this call for a standardization of materials in Ethiopia.In my research I made concrete C25,C30 and C40 as control mix by standardizing the aggregate to the Ethiopian standard
