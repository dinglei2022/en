## US6143271A Process for producing potassium sulfate from potash
The present invention provides a process for producing potassium sulfate from a potash and a sodium sulfate source,comprising the steps of: (a) treating a portion of the potash source and sodium The maximum conversion is obtained when the mother liquor approaches the KCl K 2 SO 4 glaserite H 2 O invariant point.Potash Eriez Flotation Divisionindustrialgrade KCl of up to 62.5% K2O.The basis of the dissolutioncrystallisation method of beneficiation is that KCl is much more soluble in hot water than in cold,whereas sodium chloride is only slightly more soluble at 100°C than at 20°C.The process consists of mixing the potash with hot water while agitating at.

## Potash Flotation Process 911 Metallurgist
Mar 17,2017 Flotation has been developed as the principal separating process for the potash salts which generally are coarsely crystalline and free from the sodium salts at about 10 to 14.Special techniques in reagents and temperature control and even refrigeration are all factors in the processing of these salts.Sylvinite,Other Potash Ore Processing SpringerLinkAbstract.The modern processing of sylvinite and other potash ores is usually a comparatively simple and standardized procedure,practiced in much the same way at most potash plants.In the early days of the industry,and still with some operations having complex ores or to process fines or waste streams,the ore was
