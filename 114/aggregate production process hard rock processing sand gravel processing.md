## Production &amp Process Technology goodquarry Process
The aggregates industry produces about 204 Mt per year of crushed rock and sand and gravel from over 1500 quarries throughout the UK,plus offshore dredging.Production and processing technology is a key factor in the overall operation.The four main stages in quarrying are preparation by removalConstruction aggregate WikipediaConstruction aggregate,or simply &quotaggregate" is a broad egory of coarse to medium grained particulate material used in construction,including sand,gravel,crushed stone,slag,recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates.Aggregates are the most mined materials in the world.
