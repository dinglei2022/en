## Magnetic separation Wikipedia
This separation technique can be useful in mining iron as it is attracted to a magnet.In mines where wolframite was mixed with cassiterite,such as South Crofty and East Pool mine in Cornwall or with bismuth such as at the Shepherd and Murphy mine in Moina,Tasmania,magnetic separation is used to separate the ores.&quotMagnetic Separation,&quot in Wiley Online LibraryIn the mid1800s,FARADAY demonstrated in a series of experiments that any substance placed in a magnetic field will either increase or de crease,to a varying extent,the magnetic field passing through it.This variation in the magnetic susceptibilities of different materials makes pos sible the phenomenon of magnetic
