## Designing gold extraction processes: Performance study of a case
Aug 1,2017 This paper presents a method for externalising and formalising knowledge involving the selection of hydrometallurgical process flowsheets for gold extraction from ores.A casebased reasoning (CBR) system was built using an open source software myCBR 3.0.The aim of the systems is to recommendRefining Gold HowStuffWorksThe final stage of gold production refining involves removing impurities that remain after the smelting process.Refining companies receive doré bars,as well as scrap gold,and reliquefy the metal in a furnace.Workers add borax and soda ash to the molten metal,which separates the pure gold from other precious and

## How gold is made history,used,parts,procedure,industry
Gold is generally found in two types of deposits: lode (vein) or placer deposits the mining technique used to extract the gold depends upon the type of deposit.Once extracted,the gold is refined with one of four main processes: floatation,amalgamation,cyanidation,or carboninpulp.Each process relies on the initialExtracting Gold HowStuffWorksRemoving the goldbearing rock from the ground is just the first step.To isolate pure gold,mining companies use a complex extraction process.The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces.At a mill,large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road
