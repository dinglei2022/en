Aug 9,2007 "Accelerated evaporation of moisture from the fresh concrete surface contributes to plastic shrinkage cracking," said Nielsen.He suggests producers team up with admixture specialists to customize a mix design using the appropriate admixtures to counteract hot weather effects on each appliion.High Performance Admixtures Concrete ThinkerRetarding Admixtures: These are used to delay the rate of setting of concrete.High temperatures of fresh concrete (above 85°F) are often the cause of an increased rate of hardening that makes placing and finishing concrete difficult.Concrete can be cooled by cooling the aggregates or mix water.Retarding admixtures are

For the purposes of this data sheet,hot weather is low relative humidity.□ high wind speed.AS 13791 places a 35°C limit on the maximum concrete temperature at the time of delivery.However,when the air temperature rises above.admixtures can be beneficial in hot weather conditions.What is the minimum curing time for cement concrete? QuoraThe period could be reduced to 3 days if high early strength concrete is used and the temperature is above 10º C,It also recommends that the curing duration should not be less than 10 days for concrete exposed to dry and hot weather conditions and 14 days for concrete with mineral admixtures or blended cement in hot and dry weather
