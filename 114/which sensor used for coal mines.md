## CDC Mining Contract LiDAR Tech Adaptation to UG Coal.
The explosion hazard in coal mines related to float coal dust can be mitigated by distributing the proper concentration of rock dust given the amount of float coal dust being liberated by the mining process.The proposed sensing technology aims to estimate dispersion distances of float coal dust and.S mine WikipediaThe main charge of the mine used TNT as its explosive; the propelling charge was black powder.The standard pressure sensor used a percussion cap to ignite it.The main fuse was designed to delay the firing of the propelling charge for approximately four seconds after the mine was triggered.

## Gas Detection Through the Ages EHS Today
Today,there are sensor technologies designed to detect almost any gas to which we might be exposed.Some of these technologies include,but are not limited to,infrared and photo ionization detection.Web of Things Based Remote Monitoring System for Coal Mine.The natural conditions of coal mines are highly complicated,and mining conditions are extremely capricious.Many disasters can occur in mines,which increases the insecurity of coal mining and easily leads to major accidents,causing extreme difficulty in establishing safety.
