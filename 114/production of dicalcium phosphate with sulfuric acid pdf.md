Abstract.A new process to produce defluorinated dicalcium phosphate (DCP) using phosphate rock concentrate has been developed.This new process has as main characteristic the low concentration of P 2 O 5 in the liquid phase.The process comprises three main steps: solubilization of the phosphate rock concentrate with sulfuric acid,defluorination of the phosphoric acid solution with potassium(PDF) The future of dicalcium phosphateThe acid concentration is critical: values higher than 10% HCl and 20% HNO3 cause blocking of the bed because of the formation of insoluble dicalcium phosphate and values lower than these cause.
