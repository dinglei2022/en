The first limitation can be illustrated with a simple example: the most common tumbling mill used in the lab is the Bond ball mill,used to measure the widely used Bond ball mill work index (Bond,1952).The mill dimensions,30 cm in diameter and 30 cm in length,and the test conditions are standardized,with a maximum ball&nbsp;.FM 306: SIZE REDUCTION AND SIEVINGfollowing physical mechanisms for size reduction: (i) Compression,(ii) Impact,(iii).Attrition,(iv) Cutting.Estimation of energy for the operation is important and is usually done by.To grind the given limestone material to a smaller size using a ball mill and to.Bonds law is often written in terms of the work index (Wi) as.⎟.
