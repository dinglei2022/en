Limestone is usually made of the tiny calcite skeletons of microscopic organisms that once lived in shallow seas.It dissolves in rainwater more easily than other rocks.Rainwater picks up a small amount of carbon dioxide during its passage through the air,and that turns it into a very weak acid.Calcite is vulnerable to acid.That explainsEverything You Need to Know About SandstoneBut in fact,minerals make up an important part of sandstone's geologic story.This division makes sense because limestone is made in clean ocean water,whereas silie rocks are made from sediment eroded off the continents.Mature continental sediment consists of a handful of surface minerals,

Silie minerals form the largest group of minerals on Earth,comprising the vast majority of the Earth's mantle and crust.Of the nearly four thousand known minerals on Earth,most are rare.There are only a few that make up most of the rocks likely to be encountered by surface dwelling creatures like us.The Limestone Carbonate Family of Rocks varieties,uses andAll about Limestone carbonate rocks.Secondarily,the deposits thus made may be mechanically broken up and redeposited,or they may be taken into solution,carried away and precipitated Accessory minerals,which are sometimes seen,are pyrite and quartz,the latter in minute crystals,sometimes lining cavities.

## The Limestone Carbonate Family of Rocks varieties
2012321&ensp&#0183&enspOolitic Limestone is a wellcharacterized variety of limestone,which consists of minute to small spherical concretions,presenting very much the aspect of a fish roe,whence the name from the Greek,meaning egg stone.The round grains vary in size from very minute up to those as large as a pea.Everything You Need to Know About SandstoneSandstone is formally defined strictly by particle size,but rocks made of carbonate minerals don't qualify as sandstone.Carbonate rocks are called limestone and given a whole separate classifiion,so sandstone really signifies a silierich rock.(A mediumgrained clastic carbonate rock,or &quotlimestone sandstone,&quot is called calcarenite.)

## What Minerals Are in Marble? Reference
Trace minerals of clay or iron oxides in the marble may affect the color of the rock.During metamorphism,the sedimentary and organic materials found in limestone are chemically altered,resulting in the formation of marble.Exposure to constant heat and pressure cause the calcite crystals in limestone to reform into larger interlocking patterns.Sylvania Minerals Quarry Crushed Stone Stone Supplier201981&ensp&#0183&enspThe lower unit of the formation is also approximately 100 feet thick,and is made up of dolomitic limestone largely devoid of chert.The sediments that make up the formation were deposited in a shallow marine environment that covered Michigan 410 million years ago.Some interesting fossils and minerals are occasionally found in the quarry.

The basic characteristic of cement is that after it has been mixed with water,it will set hard as rock,and will bind together any rock or mineral fragments mixed into it.Mortar for bonding bricks is made up of 1 part by volume of cement powder with 3 to 6 parts of sand,and the minimum of water to make the mix workable.What mineral makes up limestone? Yahoo Answers200863&ensp&#0183&enspFormation Limestone is chiefly composed of calcium carbonate.It is a sedimentary rock,which means that it is formed by the collection of other minerals coming together to bond at a structural level.This most commonly occurs when lime builds up in oceans,then washes ashore and dries out.

Most igneous rocks are made up of minerals which are part of the silie group.This means that they are primarily based on silicon (and oxygen).Calcite,dolomite,limestone,and marble are part of the carbonate group,which is based on calcium (and oxygen).The problem is how to start with a bunch of igneous mineralsCarbonate Minerals ThoughtCoGenerally the carbonate minerals are found at or near the surface.They represent the Earth's largest storehouse of carbon.The other point of interest about these crystals is that they are multiple twins that make these pseudohexagons.Single aragonite crystals are shaped more like tablets or prisms.it makes up most limestone and
