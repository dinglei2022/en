Because of the nature of the phosphate ore,such as mineral types and content,disseminated particle size,its separation difficulty and flotation types varies.Phosphate ore is divided into siliceous phosphorite,calcareous phosphorite,and siliceous phosphorite according to the chemical composition of the minerals.The froth flotation types differ from different types of phosphate ore greatly.How to Size a ThickenerKnowing how to size a thickener and determine the capacity required to handle a pre determined tonnage of a certain pulp,by overflowing a clear solution and obtaining the desired pulp density of thickener discharge,depends upon the settling rate of that particular pulp.The settling rate of any pulp is easily determined by simple laboratory tests such as outlined below: Laboratory Test.

## Difference Between Clarifier and Thickener
18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Difference Between a Clarifier and a Thickener is subtle as they will visually look the same.Fundamentally,thickeners and clarifiers are both used to settle solids which results in the separation of liquids and solids.Thickeners are used to concentrate solids,while clarifiers are used to purify liquids.A thickener will give you a high density underflow while a clarifier will not.The.
