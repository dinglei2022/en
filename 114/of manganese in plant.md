## Manganese Basics Spectrum Analytic
Manganese (Mn++).Functions.Manganese is essential for many plant functions.Some of them are: The assimilation of carbon dioxide in photosynthesis.It aids in the synthesis of chlorophyll and in nitrate assimilation.Manganese activates fat forming enzymes.It functions in the formation of riboflavin,ascorbic acid,andThe Biochemistry of Manganese in Plants SpringerLinkAbstract.In plants Mn has a role in many biochemical processes.However,unlike other essential trace elements such as Cu,Zn,Fe and Mo which are usually integral components of enzymes,Mn usually acts as an activator of enzymes and is often able to be replaced by other metal ions.Manganese resembles Mg in its

## Manganese deficiency (plant) Wikipedia
Manganese (Mn) deficiency is a plant disorder that is often confused with,and occurs with,iron deficiency.Most common in poorly drained soils,also where organic matter levels are high.Manganese may be unavailable to plants where pH is high.Affected plants include onion,apple,peas,French beans,cherry andManganese deficiency KeysCharacteristics and occurrence.Manganese (Mn) is present in the soil as free Mn2+,which is readily available to plants,and as oxides of low solubility.The proportion of manganese in various forms in the soil is dependent both on chemical reactions and on microbial activity.High soil pH greatly reduces the solubility of soil
