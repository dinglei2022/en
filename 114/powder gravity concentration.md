## Relative density Wikipedia
Relative density,or specific gravity,is the ratio of the density (mass of a unit volume) of a substance to the density of a given reference material Specific gravity usually means relative density with respect to water The term "relative density" is often preferred in scientific usageMass Molarity Calculator Sigma Aldrich8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The mass molarity calculator tool calculates the mass of compound required to achieve a specific molar concentration and volume.To dilute a solution of known molarity,please use the Solution Dilution Calculator.To dilute a solution of concentrated acid or base of known w w% strength,please use the Acid &amp; Base Molarity Calculator.

Density (Specific Gravity) Specific gravity is defined by ASTM D4439 (from volume 0413 on Geosynthetics) as the ratio of the density of the substance in question to the density of a reference substance at a specified condition of temperature and pressureSpecific gravity WikipediaSpecific gravity is the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of a reference substance; equivalently,it is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of a reference substance for the same given volume Apparent specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a volume of the substance to the weight of an equal volume of the reference substance
