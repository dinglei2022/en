## Effect of different parameters on grinding efficiency and its
Nov 22,2016 Today,grinding process has been successfully applied to almost all types of material removing process with extremely high material removal rate of more than 2000.Secondly,the undeformed cutting depth of each grit or cutting edge in grinding is very thin,down to sub micrometre or nanometre level.Grinding and Polishing Knowledge.StruersTo obtain a high,consistent material removal rate,short grinding times and maximum flatness,totally fixed grains with a relatively large grain size are preferred for plane grinding.Suitable PG surfaces will provide perfectly plane specimens,thus reducing the preparation time on the following fine grinding step.In addition
