## Talc Wikipedia
Notable economic talc occurrences include the Mount Seabrook talc mine,Western Australia,formed upon a polydeformed,layered ultramafic intrusion.The Francebased Luzenac Group is the world&#39s largest supplier of mined talc.Its largest talc mine at Trimouns near Luzenac in southern France produces 400,000 tonnesHow talc is formed Imerys Talc1 Yellowstone mine in Montana USA a magnesium carbonate derivative orebody.The talc results from the transformation of carbonates (dolomite and magnesite) in the presence of silica.The carbonates fix insitu the magnesium needed to form the mineral,whereas the silica is provided by hydrothermal circulation.
