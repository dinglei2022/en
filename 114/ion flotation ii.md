## Removal of Cadmium(II) from Aqueous Solution by Ion Flotation
Feb 19,2013 In this research,the potential of cadmium removal from aqueous solution by foam flotation with a rhamnolipid biosurfactant sample was studied.The effects of different major operating conditions,such as rhamnolipid and cadmium concentrations,solution pH,aeration rate,and frother type andRecovery of Metals by Ion Flotation from Dilute Aqueous SolutionsSep 24,2006 Flotation,a process originating from the minerals industry,is finding its way as a separation process for dilute aqueous solutions,with particular interest in metal ions recovery.The present paper reviewes the several flotation techniques available in this area,with certain illustrative laboratory examples.
