Dry process kilns.In a modern works,the blended raw material enters the kiln via the preheater tower.Here,hot gases from the kiln,and probably the cooled clinker at the far end of the kiln,are used to heat the raw meal.As a result,the raw meal is already hot before it enters the kiln.The dry process is much more thermallyThe cement kiln Understanding CementAlso,for many years,it was technically difficult to get dry powders to blend adequately.Quite a few wet process kilns are still in operation,usually now with highertech bits bolted on.However,new cement kilns are of the 'dry process' type.Dry process kilns.In a modern works,the blended raw material enters the kiln via the preheater

## Clinker (cement) Wikipedia
In the manufacture of Portland cement,clinker occurs as lumps or nodules,usually 3 millimetres (012 in) to 25 millimetres (098 in) in diameter,silica fume cement; Clinker,if stored in dry conditions,can be kept for several months without appreciable loss of quality Because of this,and because it can easily be handled by ordinary.Cement Production The Concrete PortalHowever,blending is much easier in a wet state Most modern plants opt for the dry process with preheaters and precalciners Precalciners (see Figure 3) are useful because a part of the burning process gets completed before the material gets to the kiln,The last step in cement manufacture is the grinding of clinker with additives.

## How Cement Is Made
Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains.The cement is now ready for transport to readymix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects.Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement,some kilns in the United States use a wet process.Cement Kilns: Special ClinkersWhite clinker can be made by dry process very efficiently,either as a "special" clinker or across the board for a plant's entire clinker production Alkalis in cement raw materials are usually associated with the aluminosilicate component of the rawmix Reduction in the clinker alkali in an efficient kiln process involves either:
