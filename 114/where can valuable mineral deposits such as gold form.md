An ore mineral is a mineral containing valuable metal(s) Ore minerals are commonly part of three groups: •Oxides such as Haematite or Chromite •Sulphides such as Galena or Chalcopyrite •Native (an element existing in its own right) such as goldProspecting for MineralsFor example,the radiation counter,of which the well known Geiger counter is one,not only can detect radioactive minerals directly,but indirectly can do more.If placer deposits contain both gold and a heavy radioactive mineral like monazite,the radiation

Feb 23,2015 Placer gold deposits form by gravity,when the density of gold causes it to sink into trap sites in the river bed,or when water velocity drops,such as at bends in rivers and behind boulders.Placer deposits are often found in sedimentary rocks and can be billions of years old,such as the Witwatersrandwhere minerals such as goldWhere can valuable mineral deposits such as gold form? Gold deposits form in the Klondike gold rush where a river slows down or settles.Also,when heavy minerals are deposited at places in a river where the current disposes or ad … justs'.OBTENIR UN PRIX
