## Density & Gravity Separators Industrial Air Tables Fluidized Bed
Dec 6,2016 Our founders,Sutton Steele & Steele,invented the first dry materials separation equipment,known today as "density or gravity separators,air tables or fluidized bed separators".Originally developed and patented in 1919,the density separation is achieved with two components,mechanical vibration and airVisual Encyclopedia of Chemical EngineeringGravity separators,or air tables,separate particles with very close specific gravities.The particles are fed onto a large,slotted deck that is tilted slightly,as shown here.The deck vibrates and fans force air upward.Denser particles travel to the high side of the deck,while lighter particles roll off the low side.
