## Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI) Procedure What Is Piping
Such regions can be detected easily by using magnetic particles (iron powder),or a liquid suspension on the surface Due to the magnetic effect,such particles are attracted to the flux leakage and make a cluster around the flaw making it visible Refer to Fig 1 showing the basic principle of magnetic particle,Q & A: Effects of rust Department of Physics,Oct 22,2007&#0183;&#32;Rusty car mufflers sometimes develop holes in them,and the sheet steel making the outer bodies of cars will often rust through,making hol Rust is a lot less magnetic than iron An iron magnet will probably still work almost as well when it has a thin coating of rust on it,but if it has rusted so badly that most of the metal is gone,then.
