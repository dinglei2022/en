## Portland Cement Compressive Strength Pavement Interactive
The most common strength test,compressive strength,is carried out on a 50 mm (2inch) cement mortar test specimen.The test specimen is subjected to a compressive load (usually from a hydraulic machine) until failure.This loading sequence must take no less than 20 seconds and no more than 80 seconds.Table 2Compressive strength WikipediaCompressive strength or compression strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size,as opposed to tensile strength,which withstands loads tending to elongate.In other words,compressive strength resists compression (being pushed together),whereas tensile strength resists
