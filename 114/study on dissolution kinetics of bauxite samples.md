## Dissolution (chemistry) Wikipedia
The reductive dissolution of a transition metal oxide can occur when a redox event in solution.as an example,the fundamental formula of reductive.(PDF) Comparative Study of the Kinetics of Dissolution ofThe strategic nature of cobalt has made it imperative to search for cobaltenriched laterites,which constitutes one of its primary sources.As there is no comprehensive study on kinetic dissolution of laterites in Nigeria,except the one reported by Olanipekun (2000) [5] on the dissolution
