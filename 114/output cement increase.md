## Environmental impact of concrete Wikipedia
One reason why the carbon emissions are so high is because cement has to be heated to very high temperatures in order for clinker to form.popularity as additives,especially since they can potentially increase strength,decrease density,and prolong durability of concrete.cement USGS Mineral Resources Programrecord (table 1).Output of clinker—the intermediate product of cement manufacture—increased by almost 4% to a new record of 81.5 Mt.The United States ranked third in the world in hydraulic cement production world output in 2002 was about.1.8 billion metric tons (Gt).In contrast to the higher cement output,continued

## Cement production capacity projected to rise by 26m tons The
Jan 6,2017 LAHORE: Encouraged by consistent domestic demand and government&#39s focus on a host of infrastructure projects,the cement industry has planned to increase its capacity by 26.25 million tons over the next two to three years to support a smooth growth of the national economy.Reviewing the sixmonthincreasing output of cement grinding in ball mill IRAJTo seal air leakage in SKS Separator with uniform air gap increases output of cement mill.Proper distribution of grinding media with appropriate sizes also enhanced productivity of cement mill.Target To increase the TPH from 190 to 220 TPH (PPC) with maintaining quality parameter i.e.8% residue on +45 micron.
