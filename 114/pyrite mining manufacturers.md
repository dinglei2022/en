## Cement,How It Is Produced
Cement manufacture,like many other manufacturing processes,begins at the mine,where the raw materials like limestone,silica,aluminates,feric minerals and others are obtained.Some typical materials used for iron in cement manufacturing are iron ores,blast furnace flue dusts,pyrite clinker,mill scale,and fly ash.pyrite mining in china YouTubeAug 2,2016 Contact Us For Help: Magnetic Separation Pyrite,China Coal Mining China Coal Mining has been the largest manufacturing base of mining equipments in China and has been the best selling among the mining equipments manufacturer in the LA,ICP,MS trace

## Pyrite Mineral Uses and Properties Geology
Although this is a tiny fraction of the ore,the value of gold is so high that the pyrite might be a worthwhile mining target.If pyrite contains 0.25% gold and the gold price is $1500 per troy ounce,then one ton of pyrite will contain about 73 troy ounces of gold worth over $109,000.That is not a guaranteed moneymaker.Reducing Canadian Mining&#39s Environmental ImpactJul 29,2014 Mines that are loed near water can do considerable harm to the surface water by polluting it.Although the mining companies do abide by federal laws,it still does not solve the issue completely.One example of this case is from the Northland Pyrite Mine loed in Canada.The nearby fresh surface water

## Pyrite Wikipedia
Pyrite has been used since classical times to manufacture copperas,that is,iron(II) sulfate.Iron pyrite was heaped up and allowed to weather (an example of an early form of heap leaching).The acidic runoff from the heap was then boiled with iron to produce iron sulfate.In the 15th century,such leaching began to replace
