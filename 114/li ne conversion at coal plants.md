## How Power Grids Work
Large electrical generators happen to generate AC naturally,so conversion to DC would involve an extra step.The smaller transformers attached to the bus are stepping the power down to standard line voltage (usually 7,200 volts) for one set of lines,while power leaves in the other direction at the higher voltage of theClosing of State Line Power Station,on IllinoisIndiana Border,IsFeb 11,2012 The coalfired State Line Power Station,on the IllinoisIndiana border,is closing in March.That is bad news for its employees and the local economy But Dominion and Midwest Generation,which owns the Chicago plants,said converting would be too expensive.Doug McFarlan,a spokesman for Midwest

## How big are Power line losses? Schneider Electric Blog
Mar 25,2013 Electricity has to be transmitted from large power plants to the consumers via extensive networks.The transmission over long distances creates power losses.The major part of the energy losses comes from Joule effect in transformers and power lines.The energy is lost as heat in the conductors.Steam Plant Facilities ServicesThe #1 boiler is a converted coal fired boiler,which can produce 70,000 pound of steam per hour with either natural gas or #2 diesel.In the event of the loss of the 450psi gas line the plant still maintains two 300 HP gas compressors that boost the gas pressure up to 225 psi,which are needed for the Solar gas turbine
