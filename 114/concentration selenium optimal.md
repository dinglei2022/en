## How much selenium every day? Seleniumfacts
So,it is difficult to say who is average and normal and then suggest an ideal daily dosage of selenium.What do the numbers from selenium studies say? Let&#39s look at the numbers from published research and see what sense we can make of them.Remember: we humans need adequate plasma selenium concentrations forSelenium an overview ScienceDirect TopicsSelenium.Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element required for the optimal functioning of more than 25 proteins that mostly play a part in antioxidant defense.Many factors dictate the concentration of selenium in plants including but not limited to the type of vegetation,chemical form of selenium in the soil,pH of soil,

Meanwhile however,SePP concentration in plasma is deemed to be the most conclusive marker for determining the optimum supply of selenium [9 12].The SePP concentration does not indie a maximum level until a plasma selenium concentration of 100 μg l to 120 μg l is reached whilst GPx activity in plasma reachesSES Clinical: Selenium,Serum Mayo Medical LaboratoriesSelenium accumulates in biological tissue.The normal concentration in adult human blood serum is 70 to 150 ng mL (0.15 parts per million) with a population mean value of 98 ng mL.Optimal selenium concentration is age dependent (see Reference Values) children require less circulating selenium than do adults.

however,plasma selenoprotein P concentration (with anticancer properties) has been judged as the best plasma biomarker for assessing optimal expression of all selenoproteins,requiring a larger Se intake than for GPx activity.2.In addition,individual selenium requirements increase with obesity,cigarette smoking,Optimization of selenoprotein P and other plasma seleniumJun 23,2010 GPX activity was optimized by 21 lg (total ingestion: 35 lg d).The selenium concentration showed no tendency to become optimized.Conclusions: The present results indie that SEPP1 concentration is the best plasma biomarker studied for assessing optimal expres sion of all selenoproteins,because its

## Selenium: Dietary Intake And Plasma Values,What&#39s Optimal For
May 28,2015 How much selenium is optimal for health? To address this question,I&#39ll examine the association between circulating levels of selenium with allcause mortality risk.Then,I&#39ll identify a dietary selenium intake that corresponds to optimal plasma selenium levels.Let&#39s have a look! A variety of studies haveOptimal selenium status linked to better mood for young adults: StudyNov 10,2014 The study,which shows correlation and not causation,also suggested that the association between selenium status and the risk of depressive symptoms was Ushaped,meaning that too low and too high levels of the trace mineral may detrimentally affect mood."In young adults,an optimal range of serum

## Selenium in biology Wikipedia
In fish and other wildlife,low levels of selenium cause deficiency while high levels cause toxicity.For example,in salmon,the optimal concentration of selenium in the fish tissue (whole body) is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of tissue (dry weight).At levels much below that concentration,young salmon die fromSelenium and the Thyroid Gland Alex Fok Endocrine PracticeOct 27,2014 Standard plasma selenium concentrations range between 60 and 120 μg l or 0·8 ± 0·36 μmol l.Indeed,plasma selenium concentration is related to dietary selenium,whereas selenoprotein P reflects selenium stocks in the body and appears a better marker of selenium status.[6].It is not recommended to
