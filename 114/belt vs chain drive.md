## Why would you use a belt drive instead of a chain drive.
Learn AI the project based way.A belt drive will give you lower efficiency power transmission (although this depends on the kind of belt,toothed belt or V belt,etc) yet less NVH levels (noise,vibration,harshness) than a chaindrive.However a chain drive will allow higher levels of misalignment.Chain vs Belt vs Shaft Are some power transferals.Is there any real advantage to chain over belt.Chain vs Belt vs Shaft Are some power transferals.Regarding the power costs of a shaft final drive vs.chain.
