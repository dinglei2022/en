## Variation in soil strength,bulk density and gravel.
This study was carried out at Abeokuta,south western Nigeria,to understand the variation in soil strength,gravel distribution,and bulk density along a toposequence.Aggregates in ConcreteConcrete Technology.Aggregates for Concrete.Concrete Technology.9.▫ Natural mineral aggregates,i.e.sand and gravel have a bulk density of 95 to 105 lbs ft3.(1520 1680 kg m3) and produce Normal.Weight concrete (NWC).▫ NWC unit weight: 150 lbs ft3 (2400 Kg m3).▫ Aggregates with bulk densities less than 70.
