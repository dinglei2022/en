## Does sulfuric acid react with copper?
Copper does not react with dilute sulphuric acid as its reduction potential is higher than that of hydrogen.Copper does not displace hydrogen from non oxidising acids like HCl or dilute H2SO4.But,concentrated sulphuric acid is an oxidising agen.intensifiion of zinc dissolution process in sulphuric acid CiteSeerXaccelerated dissolving of metal zinc in sulphuric acid by introducing copper hode on which evolving hydrogen is much (in this case it is zinc),in sulphuric acid solution,represents the complex reaction consisting of several The reaction of zinc dissolution in sulphuric acid solution can be represented by the equation
