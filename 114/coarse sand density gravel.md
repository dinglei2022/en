1.Introduction.Sandgravel mixture (SGM) is widely encountered in many infrastructures,such as slopes,dams and railway foundations,.The performance of these infrastructures will be largely affected by the mechanical behavior of the gravelly soils.However,the complex composite of the mixture brings difficulties to its performance evaluations or perfections.what is the density of river sand and coarse aggregate201373&ensp&#0183&enspEvaluation of gravel for concrete and road aggregates,Rapti River.The river sediments are chiefly gravel with few sand and mud.Gravel (coarse aggregates greater than mm) can be easily collected from the river area after &#187More detailed
