## Use Of Recycled Aggregate In Concrete
recycled aggregate produced only 0.0024 million ton carbon is produced.Considering the global consumption of 10 billion tons year of aggregate for concrete production,the carbon footprint can be determined for the natural aggregate as well as forBond behavior of Hshaped steel embedded in recycled aggregateJun 30,2016 Twenty two pushout tests were carried out in order to investigate the bond behavior between Hshaped steel and recycled aggregate concrete (RAC).Eleven kinds of recycled coarse aggregate (RCA)
