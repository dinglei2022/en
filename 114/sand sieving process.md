## Field method for sieve analysis of sand Journal of Sedimentary
Abstract.A field method for the mechanical analysis of sand is attained by using a sieve and cylinder combination.The sand is passed through a nest of sieves,and the fraction remaining on each is measured in a graduate cylinder.This method is simple and rapid,and the results obtained are comparable with the settlingsieve analysis Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary[Well Completions].The process of analyzing the size distribution of a sand or gravel sample.In sandcontrol appliions,a sample of formation sand is shaken through a series of sieves of known size.The resulting distribution is then used to design an appropriate treatment that will retain the sand,while causing a minimal
