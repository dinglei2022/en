## titanium processing Technology,Methods,&amp Facts
Titanium processing,the extraction of titanium from its ores and the preparation of titanium alloys or compounds.The high reactivity of titanium with oxygen,nitrogen,and hydrogen in the air at elevated temperatures necessitates complied and therefore costly production and fabriion processes.CA2342665A1 Titanium oxide production process GoogleA process for producing a titanium oxide is provided which comprises the steps of (i) reacting a titanium compound with ammonia in an amount exceeding the stoichiometric amount necessary to convert the titanium compound to a titanium hydroxide or reacting a titanium compound with a base at pH of from about 2 to about 7,to obtain a reaction product and (ii) calcining the obtained product.
