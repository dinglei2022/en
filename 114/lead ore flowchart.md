## Silver Lead Zinc Ore Processing Method using Flotation
Mar 19,2017 Sulphide ore of lead and zinc containing considerable silver was submitted for testing with the purpose of determining a flowsheet for the production of separate lead and zinc concentrates for marketing at their respective smelters.It is necessary to recover as much silver as possible in the lead concentrateClassifiion,Distribution and Uses of Ores and Ore Springersouthwestern United States,the clusters of leadzinc deposits in northeastern.Australia,and the tin deposits of SE Asia.For both geological and economic reasons,it is important to have some knowledge of this distribution.From a geological point of view,the distribution provides important clues to the oreforming process
