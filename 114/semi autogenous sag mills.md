## The transition from semi autogenous to autogenous milling,
The transition from semi autogenous to autogenous milling at Waihi Gold C Haines and D Bertoldi AusIMM Mill Operators Conference 2016 ABSTRACT The Waihi Gold Mine (WGM) operated by OceanaGold New Zealand Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of,Semi Autogenous Autogenous Grinding Mills Sag Mills MarketSemi Autogenous and Autogenous Grinding Mills Market is driven by need for energy efficient solutions as grinding consumes more energy,Semi Autogenous and Autogenous Grinding Mills are used for grinding large chunks of materials into small pieces which can be used for processing SAG Mills,
