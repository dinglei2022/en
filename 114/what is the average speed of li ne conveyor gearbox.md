## 5.Chain Speed John King Chains
Chain speed,normally calculated in feet or metres per minute,is a critical consideration in determining the conveyor capacity.It is in considering this parameter that conveyor chain pitch and conveyor chain drive and idler sprocket can be determined.fig.5.1 illustrates the relationship between speed,chain pitch and sprocket size.How to calculate conveyor speed in feet per minuteHow to calculate conveyor speed in feet per minute.Many times packagers are familiar with their bottling requirements in terms of containers per minute (CPM).When Enercon sizes a cap sealing system for an appliion we rely on the conveyor speed expressed in feet per minute (FPM).
