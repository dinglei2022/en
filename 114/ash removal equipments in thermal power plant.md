## Effective use of coal ash [KEPCO]
Coal fired thermal power stations mainly use coal as a fuel,but they produce a large quantity of coal ash following the coal combustion.We constructed the Maizuru Power Station as our only coal fired thermal power station in Maizuru,Kyoto.By recycling this coal ash in the form of a raw material for cement and construction&nbsp;.Ash related Issues in Biomass CombustionWithin ThermalNet,WP2D particularly focuses on ash related issues in biomass combustion.A key deliverable is a report summarizing the issues,which is currently available in draft for comments.In the ash one can distinguish inorganic components contained in the biomass,as well as extraneous inorganic material such as sand.
