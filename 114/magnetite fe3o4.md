## Some Magnetic Properties of Magnetite (Fe3O4) Microcrystals
Single‐domain particles of Fe3O4 have been observed to exhibit superparamagnetic behavior with the Mössbauer effect.Using a simple theory for the spin relaxation,it was possible to make an approximate curve fit of the spectra,taking into account the particle‐size distribution of the samples.For a sample prepared by a
