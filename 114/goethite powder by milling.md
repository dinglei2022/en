## Goethite Wikipedia
Goethite is an iron bearing hydroxide mineral of the diaspore group.It is found in soil and other lowtemperature environments.Goethite has been well known since ancient times for its use as a pigment (brown ochre).Evidence has been found of its use in paint pigment samples taken from the caves of Lascaux in France.Graphite Wikipedia20191115&ensp&#0183&enspPowder and scrap.The powder is made by heating powdered petroleum coke above the temperature of graphitization,sometimes with minor modifiions.The graphite scrap comes from pieces of unusable electrode material (in the manufacturing stage or after use) and lathe turnings,usually after crushing and sizing.

## Under which conditions can iron oxide absorb water? ResearchGate
Iron oxides aren&#39t particularly good at absorbing water.It is a purely physical process based on available surface areaWustite,hematite,and magnetite do not have water&#39s of hydration so there is no chemical absorption.You may have some better absorption with the crystal phase transition into the oxyhydroxides though.
