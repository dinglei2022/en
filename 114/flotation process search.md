## 60 Centuries of Copper: The Flotation Process
The Flotation Process.Until quite recently copper ore had to be handpicked if the extraction of the metal was to be economical.In fact,in the last century,ores of 4 percent grade were regarded as almost valueless.Today such ores (which would be regarded as relatively rich in copper) are scarce the great majority of minesEFFECT OF WATER QUALITY ON FROTH STABILITY IN FLOTATIONprocess water chemistry on plants metallurgical performance becomes significant,and it is not yet fully understood.Kurniawan et al.(2010) Studied effect of MgCl2,NaCl,and NaClO3 on froth stability in coal flotation.They showed that the froth stability increases with increasing salt concentration,with MgCl2 giving the most

Froth flotation is considered to be the most widely used method for ore beneficiation.In ore beneficiation,flotation is a process in which valuable minerals are separated from worthless material or other valuable minerals by inducing them to gather in and on the surface of a froth layer.Sulfide and nonsulfide minerals as wellFlotation Thickening SpringerLinkFlotation is a solidliquid separation process.Separation is artificially induced by introducing fine gas bubbles (usually air) into the flotation process system.The gas bubbles become attached to
