## Difference Between Clarifier and Thickener 911 Metallurgist
May 15,2017 The Difference Between a Clarifier and a Thickener is subtle as they will visually look the same.Fundamentally,thickeners and clarifiers are both used to settle solids which results in the separation of liquids and solids.Thickeners are used to concentrate solids,while clarifiers are used to purify liquids.A MODEL OF CONTINUOUS SEDIMENTATION OF UiOstationary modes of operation is performed.Numerical examples illustrate that the model realistically describes the dynamics of flocculated suspensions in clarifierthickeners.Key words.clarifierthickener units,discontinuous flux,degenerate diffusion,uniqueness,sta tionary solutions,finite difference scheme,numerical
