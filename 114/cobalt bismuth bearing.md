## Ore and Skarn Mineralogy of the Yamato Mine,Yamaguchi
Assemblages and chemical compositions of ore minerals from the Yamato mine,Yamaguchi Prefecture,Japan,were investigated in detail to clarify its characteristics as a skarn deposit.Special attention was paid to silver,bismuth,cobalt,and tinbearing sulfide minerals and native gold at the mine,which are describedProcon invests $12M in Fortune Minerals The Northern MinerJul 10,2013 There,the bulk concentrate would undergo more grinding and flotation to produce separate goldbearing cobalt and bismuth concentrates.According to Fortune,the high concentration ratio of NICO&#39s ore is a big attribute because it helps the company transport highvalue concentrate to southern Canada,

## Bismuth and cobalt minerals as indiors of stringer zones to
The stringer zones and commonly the interaction zone at the base of the massive sulphide mounds in the Iberian Pyrite Belt contain bismuth and cobalt minerals at world scale (nuffieldite,giessenite,jaskolskiite) that were deposited from last stage hightemperature (&gt 300 °C) copperbearing fluids containing Bi (Te,Se).Cobalt Metal Properties,Production,and Appliions The BalanceHe demonstrated that the blue pigment arose from cobalt,not arsenic or bismuth as alchemists originally believed.After its isolation,cobalt Cobalt naturally occurs in nickelbearing laterites and nickelcopper sulfide deposits and,thus,is most often extracted as a byproduct of nickel and copper.According to the Cobalt

## Bismuth: Bismuth mineral information and data.Mindat
As a chemical element Bismuth was officially discovered in 1753 by French scientist Claude Geoffroy.The origin of the name comes from the German words Weisse Masse meaning white mass.However,around 1400 the element name is already present in some scientific treaties.In fact before Geoffroy,also the SwissUS6273970B1 Aluminumbismuth bearing alloy and methods forThe invention provides an aluminum alloy having a homogenous distribution of bismuth therein comprising at least 5 wt wt % bismuth,wherein about 3.5 wt wt % of the bismuth is distributed in the form of very small particles of up to 5 microns diameter and at least 2 wt wt % of the bismuth is distributed in the form of spherical
