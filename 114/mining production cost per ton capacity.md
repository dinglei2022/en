## Activity Based Costing: Challenging the way we cost.
Process Costing (PC).The coal mining industry uses ‘ton of coal mined’ as its unit of measure rather than labour.PC is commonly used as the costing measure in systems where the outputs are continuous (as opposed to batch outputs) and is designed for the accumulation of costs for mass production like units (one ton of coal in our case).Assessing mining processes for best valueHowever,plants always expand as reducing production is not a viable option.The cost per ton goes up in smaller plants and expansions are driven by value per tonne.Before heading into action,consider basic process factors,such as: Is the circuit properly configured? That is,can the process flow be altered to increase production?
