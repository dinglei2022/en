## Crushed Stone: Limestone,Granite,Traprock and More Geology
In addition to its suitability for many uses,limestone is also used to make crushed stone because it breaks easily and is softer than the steel used in crushing equipment,classifying equipment and truck beds.Rail and barge transport have lowered costs per tonmile however,very few quarries are on rail lines or rivers.Keeping Us in Line: Train Tracks HowStuffWorksRailroad tracks guide the train,acting as the lowfriction surface on which the train runs and often transferring the weight of the train to the ground below.The track may also provide electrical power along the third rail,as you&#39ll recall.A railroad track consists of two parallel steel rails set a fixed distance apart,called the gauge

## Buffer Stop
Buffer Stop.A buffer stop or bumper is a device to prevent railway vehicles from going past the end of a physical section of track.The design of the buffer stop is dependent in part upon the kind of couplings that the railway uses,since the coupling gear is the first part of the vehicle that the buffer stop touches.
