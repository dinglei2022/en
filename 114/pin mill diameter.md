## Size reduction
A pin mill is equipped with a static disc mounted with several pins and a mobile one also mounted with pins.When the product is forced passing through the system,it has to be impacted by the pins,and therefore be broken and its size reduced.CENTRIFUGAL IMPACT MILLS (PIN MILLS)the stationary pins and rotating pins before reaching the outlet.To vary the tight range of particle sizes desired,the operator simply adjusts the speed at which the inner disc rotates,from several hundred to more than 5000 rpm depending on mill diameter.This extreme flexibility enables a Munson Pin Mill,with no modifications,to grind friable
