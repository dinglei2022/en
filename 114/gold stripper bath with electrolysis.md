SELECTIVE ELECTROWINNING OF SILVER AND GOLD FROM CYANIDE PROCESS SOLUTIONS By F H Nehl,1 J E Murphy,2 G B Atkinson,3 and L A Walters2 ABSTRACT The US Bureau of Mines investigated the selective electrowinning of Ag and Au from cyanide solu&#173; tions contaminated with Cu with the goal of decreasing the amount of Cu codepositedWashing Soda In Electrolyte Bath removal Of Paint And,Nov 24,2015&#0183;&#32;More recently it was suggested to me by a chemist to mix the caustic with wallpaper paste and apply with a stiff brush and stippling Worked for me,but not quite as well as a long soak in the caustic bath Of course this won't remove rust,you will need the electrolysis,

## Electrolytic Stripping a "Greener" Alternative to Immersion
Jan 15,2014 Although chemical immersion strippers are most widely used today,electrolytic stripping is gaining more popularity.Chemical immersion strippers have a limited bath life.Acidic strippers,such as mineral acids (i.e.nitric acid,etc.) are tenacious on racks,causing dehydration of the plastisol coating andElectrolytic Copper Plating Additives and Contaminants4 Additives Mostly Proprietary Brighteners are plating accelerators,which act as a micro leveler and impact grain refinement They tend to be attracted to cathode induction zone points of higher electro potential,temporarily packing the area and forcing copper to deposit elsewhere
