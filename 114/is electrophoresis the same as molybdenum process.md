## Twodimensional gel electrophoresis an overview ScienceDirect
Twodimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) is the classical method to separate proteins on the basis of their charge (isoelectric focusing,IEF) and of their size (sodium It builds on 2DE by adding a highly accurate quantitative dimension,which enables multiple protein extracts to be separated on the same 2D gel.Gel electrophoresis (article) Khan AcademyAll DNA molecules have the same amount of charge per mass.Because of this,gel electrophoresis of DNA fragments separates them based on size only.Using electrophoresis,we can see how many different DNA fragments are present in a sample and how large they are relative to one another.We can also determine the
