4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Tool steel refers to a variety of carbon and alloy steels that are particularly well suited to be made into tools.Their suitability comes from their distinctive hardness,resistance to abrasion and deformation,and their ability to hold a cutting edge at elevated temperatures.As a result,tool steels are suited for use in the shaping of other materials.The Four Types of Steel Metal SupermarketsMar 23,2015 While there are many ways to egorize steel,we find it useful to break steel down into four egories (Carbon,Alloy,Stainless and Tool Steel).In this fourpart blog series,(Part 2,Part 3,Part 4) we take an indepth look at some of the most common egories of steels,what makes them different,and
