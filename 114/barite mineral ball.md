## What is Barite? Industrial Minerals Association North America
Barite is the primary,naturally occurring,bariumbased mineral.Barite&#39s high density and chemical inertness make it an ideal mineral for many appliions.compounds,radiation shielding,television and computer monitors,sounddeadening material in automobiles,traffic cones,brake linings,paint and golf balls.Barium Minerals Eduion CoalitionBarium (Ba) is obtained chiefly from the mineral barite.Barium is a soft,silvery,reactive metal.Because barium is so dense it is commonly used in some alloys,for example in spark plugs and ball bearings.As of 2013,China,India and Morocco were the world&#39s largest producers of barium.In the U.S,barite is.
