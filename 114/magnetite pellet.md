## Estimation of Sintering Kinetics of Magnetite Pellet Using Optical
Nov 16,2015 During induration of magnetite pellets,oxidation of magnetite followed by sintering of the oxidized magnetite (hematite) is desirable.Sintering of magnetite which hampers the oxidation of magnetiteMagnetite makes a comeback under magnateMagnetite host rocks do not contain alumina,but contain silica.Because it has a lower iron content than hematite,magnetite has been regarded as a less attractive proposition.In the 1980s,the iron ore industry was characterised by clanging of gates closing on uneconomic pellet plants.&quotEvery operator in the Pilbara.

## Ecoefficient and costeffective process design for magnetite iron ore
Many banded iron formation deposits are very fine grained,often requiring a final concentrate grind size P80 of 2535 μm (see liberation curve of magnetite in Figure 2).The amount of energy required to produce a magnetite product suitable for sale as pellet plant feed from these deposits is an order of magnitude higherUnderstanding Pellets and Pellet Plant Operations ispatguruMar 21,2015 Their invention showed that it was possible to ball or pelletize fine magnetite concentrate in a balling drum and that if the balls were fired at sufficiently high temperature (usually below the point of incipient fusion) a hard,indurated pellet well adapted for use in the blast furnace,could be made.Consequently

## Recrystallization of Fe2O3 During the Induration of Iron IntechOpen
Mar 7,2012 Introduction.Magnetite and hematite concentrates are the two main raw materials for oxidized pellet production.Magnetite concentrates have more predominance due to the heat release by oxidation during roasting and may reduce energy consumption (Jiang et al.2008 Li et al..2009).However,with theOxidation and Sintering Characteristics of Magnetite Iron Ore PelletsAdditives can give rise to obvious,stepwise changes both in the oxidation process and in the sintering process.Therefore,the oxidation and sintering characteristics measured in dried pellets prepared from pure magnetite concentrates can not be representative for those characteristics in dried pellets containing additives.
