## Nickel: smelting,producingMetalpedia
Nickel is recovered through extractive metallurgy: it is extracted from its ores by conventional roasting and reduction processes that yield a metal of greater than 75% purity.In many stainless steel appliions,75% pure nickel can be used without further purifiion,depending on the composition ofNickel Mining,Nickel Mines,Nickel Mine,Copper MiningFirstly,the sulfide ores are crushed and ground to liberate nickel containing minerals from the waste material by floatation process where the ore is mixed with certain reagents and disturbed by mechanical devices that produce air bubbles which rise above the mixture and are collected as a concentrate as the sulfide particles stick to their

While nickel can be found in a great variety of minerals most commercial mining is focused on two types of ore deposits laterites and magmatic sulphides.The principal ore minerals of laterite deposits are nickeliferous limonite and garnierite,and the principal ore for magmatic sulfide deposits mineral is pentlanditei.In termsSulfide minerals Wikipedia2019115&ensp&#0183&enspThe sulfide minerals are a class of minerals containing sulfide (S2−) or persulfide (S22−) as the major anion.Some sulfide minerals are economically important as metal ores.The sulfide class also includes the selenides,the tellurides,the arsenides,the antimonides,the bismuthinides,the sulfarsenides and the sulfosalts.[1][2] Sulfide
