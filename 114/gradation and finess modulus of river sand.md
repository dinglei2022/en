## What Is the Fineness Modulus of Fine Aggregate? Reference
The fineness modulus number affects the workability and finish of concrete.Before calculating fineness modulus,lab technicians pour aggregate onto sieves.Fineness modulus is the sum of the total percentages of the aggregate retained on each sieve divided by 100.Natural sand or crushed stone is used to achieve a fine rating,with mostS.I.No.354 1949 Standard Specifiion (Coarse and Fine(vi) In order to control the grading of fine aggregate from any one source a preliminary sample shall be submitted before actual deliveries are made.This sample shall be representative of the material which it is proposed to supply.The fineness modulus of this sample and of samples from subsequent consignments shall be
