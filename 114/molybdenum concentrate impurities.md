## Molybdenite Flotation Plant newsmolybdenum
Molybdenum ore beneficiation methods are mainly flotation recovery of molybdenum is molybdenite mineral Sometimes,in order to improve the quality of molybdenum,remove impurities,will further chemical processing molybdenum concentrate outside the groundsMolybdenite flotation reagents in a non polar oil as collector,while adding a foaming agentReaction mechanisms of low grade molybdenum concentrate,The effects of Ca based additives on roasting properties of low grade molybdenum concentrate were studied The results show that calcium based additives can react with molybdenum concentrate to form CaSO 4 and CaMoO 4The initial oxidation temperature of MoS 2 is 450 &#176;C,while the formation of CaMoO 4 and CaSO 4 occurs above 500 &#176;C The whole calcification reactions are nearly completed.
