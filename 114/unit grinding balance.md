18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Some wheel adapters have provision for adding balance weights,or have weights that can be moved around a track.I had neither,so made an add on to accept screws and washers as weights.Before continuing,I want to cover a few important safety items.Grinding is generally safe as long as wheel integrity isn't compromised.026 GRINDING WHEEL BALANCING & INSTALLATION,GRINDINGMar 5,2014 Proper installation,balancing and dressing of a grinding wheel is crucial if you wish to get a good finish and accurate dimensions.We use a similar balancing technique and unit to balance motorcycle wheel when doing tire changes.026 grinding wheel balancing I believe just helped me the most.
