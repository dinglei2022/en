Nov 19,2019&#0183;&#32;Concrete is the most widely used man made material,commonly used in buildings,roads,bridges and industrial plants But producing the Portland cement needed to make concrete accounts for 5 8% of.Magnesium oxide MgO PubChemMagnesium Oxide is the oxide salt of magnesium with antacid,laxative and vascular smooth muscle relaxant activities.Magnesium combines with water to form magnesium hydroxide which reacts chemically to neutralize or buffer existing quantities of stomach acid stomachcontent and intraesophageal pH rise,resulting in a decrease in pepsin activity.This agent's laxative effect is the result
