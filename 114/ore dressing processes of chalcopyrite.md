## Chalcopyrite an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Copper is widely distributed in the environment present mainly in minerals as sulphides,oxides,or carbonates,with the major ores being chalcopyrite (CuFeS2),chalcocite (Cu2S),In this process,even heavy metals may lose their original properties,and the final product is a complex,herbomineral ultrafine powder.Improvement of copper molybdenum ore beneficiation using aA combined flowsheet and a beneficiation process for bulk flotation middlings of copper molybdenum ore have been suggested,which include middlings The quantitative mineralogical analysis of middlings flotation tailings demonstrated that a great part of chalcopyrite (65%) occurs in the form of aggregates (Table 2).
