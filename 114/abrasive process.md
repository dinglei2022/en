## Ultrasonic machining Wikipedia
Ultrasonic machining,or strictly speaking the "Ultrasonic vibration machining",is a subtraction manufacturing process that removes material from the surface of a part through high frequency,low amplitude vibrations of a tool against the material surface in the presence of fine abrasive particles.Abrasive Blast Systems & Blasting Services Sharretts PlatingAbrasive blasting gives you the ability to combine surface cleaning and finishing into one cost effective process.With abrasive blasting,high pressure is used to propel a stream of abrasive media against a surface to remove contaminants and alter the shape or texture if desired.
