## Magnet Wikipedia
A magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic field.This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials,such as iron,and attracts or repels other magnets.The overall strength of a magnet is measured by its magneticHybrid magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with tunable fielddirectedWe describe the synthesis of hybrid magnetic ellipsoidal nanoparticles that consist of a mixture of two different iron oxide phases,hematite (αFe2O3) and maghemite (γFe2O3),and characterize their magnetic fielddriven selfassembly.We demonstrate that the relative amount of the two phases can be adjuste.

## Why Does a Magnet Attract Iron? Sciencing
Feb 5,2018 Most people know that iron is attracted to magnets,while other metals like gold and silver are not.Yet few people can explain exactly why iron has this magical relationship with magnetism.To arrive at the answer,you need to get down to the atomic level and examine the magnetic nature of an atom&#39sWhy is iron a magnetic metal but aluminum is not? ResearchGateOn the atomic and nuclear scale,magnetism is carried by the spins of the particles,which are the elementary magnets,or by electric currents circulating in loops,raising an orbital magnetic momentum.Nuclear magnetism is less relevant in daily life experience,and the main effect originates in electronic spin.Spin is the
