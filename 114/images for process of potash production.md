Image by Jeffrey Heyden Kaye,What is Potash? Potash got its name from the old process used to harvest potassium This was where wood ash was separated in old pots to soak and the potassium was leached from the mash,hence the name “pot ash”,It leaches into waterways and gets taken up as salts which go through production and,Overview mosaicco2019626&ensp&#0183&enspPotash.Mosaic is a leader in the potash industry with annual capacity of 10.5 million tonnes of product per year.Production during 2016 totaled 7.6 million tonnes,or approximately 13% of estimated world annual production and 42% of estimated North American annual production.
