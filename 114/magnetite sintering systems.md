## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview IntechOpen
The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years,owing to increasing steel demands in developing countri However,the content of iron in ore deposits has deteriorated and low grade iron ore has been processed The fines resulting from the concentration process must be agglomerated for use in iron and steelmaking This chapter shows the status of the pelletizing process.A method of manufacturing magnetite anodes for cathodic,In addition,the process of sintering in air,not in a vacuum,even in sealed capsules at sintering temperature due to thermodynamic instability may be magnetite Fe 3 O 4 in the iron oxide hematite (Fe 2 O 3),this sharp increase in the resistivity,which will be impossible to use such anodes to work
