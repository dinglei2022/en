## Calcium and Phosphate Homeostasis vivo.colostate.edu
Body Distribution of Calcium and Phosphate.There are three major pools of calcium in the body: Intracellular calcium: A large majority of calcium within cells is sequestered in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum.Intracellular free calcium concentrations fluctuate greatly,from roughly 100 nM to greater than 1 uM,due toPhosphorus and water: The USGS Water Science SchoolSince groundwater often discharges into surface water,such as through streambanks into rivers,there is a concern about phosphorus concentrations in groundwater affecting the water quality of surface water.Phosphorus is an essential element for plant life,but when there is too much of it in water,it can speed up
