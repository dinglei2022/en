## Heap Leach Pads Mining Technology InfoMine
Heap leaching is the process to extract precious metals like gold,silver,copper and uranium from their ore by placing them on a pad (a base) in a heap and sprinkling a leaching solvent,such as cyanide or acids,over the heap.This process dissolves the metals and they collect at the bottom of the pad.The metal is thenCyanide Heap Leaching WA DNRDec 30,1994 Cyanide heap leaching is a process for recovering gold and silver by trickling cyanide solutions through lowgrade ore that has been stacked on openair pads.(Fig.1).Cyanide heapleach methods are viewed by industry as offering a lowcost means of producing precious metals.The natural oxidizing
