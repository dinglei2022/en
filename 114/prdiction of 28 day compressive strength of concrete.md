## Models for Prediction of 28Day Concrete Compressive Strength
Mar 28,2014&nbsp&#0183&#32Concrete specimens are cast and tested at 28 days to ensure compliance of concrete strength with the design requirements.Prediction of concrete strength can help in reducing waiting time and can result in speeding up construction activities.This paper presents prediction models for concrete compressive strength up to 28 days.Prediction of 28 day compressive strength of concrete,In other words,the 3 day compressive strength of concrete is a very good criterion to achieve the 28 day compressive strength It is conceived from figure3 that the higher the 3 day compressive strength the higher is the 28 day compressive strength of the concrete

## The 28Day Myth National Precast Concrete Association
Oct 28,2013&nbsp&#0183&#32It is estimated that concrete reaches 75% of this 28day compressive strength in seven days,and its strength will remain stable or even increase over time (2).A specific ratio can be determined for each specific mix design and curing process to finetune this arbitrary age so that the mix design dictates the 28day compressive strength.Prediction of compressive strength of concrete by neural,Concrete strength is influenced by lots of factors If we consider strength prediction as a mapping from the influencing factors to the 28 day compressive strength,then a mapping model can be created by using multi layer feed forward neural networks (MFNNs) instead of regression equation

## Prediction of Compressive Strength of Concrete by Data,
Abstract The aim of this study is prediction of 28 day compressive strength of concrete by data driven models Hence,by considering concrete constituents as input variables,two data driven models namely Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are constructed for the purpose of predicting the 28 days compressive strength of different concrete,Comparison of Fuzzy Logic and ANFIS for,In order to predict the 28 day compressive strength of Ready Mix Concrete,FUZZY LOGIC,ANFIS models having five inputs and one output was applied successfully,and ANFIS model exhibited the more reliable predictions than the fuzzy models
