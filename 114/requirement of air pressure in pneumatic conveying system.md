## Beware Dense Phase Pneumatic Conveying Running as a Dilute,
High pressure systems are known as dense phase pneumatic conveying systems These systems utilize air pressure above 15 psig (up to 50 psig) at the entry and use positive pressure to push materials through the conveying line at relatively low velocities (from 100 fpm to a maximum of 1000 fpm),much like extrudingPneumatic Conveying Design Guide Nong Lam University182 Air only pressure drop method 405 183 Universal conveying characteristics method 413,For this second edition of the Pneumatic Conveying Design Guide I have followed a,Pneumatic conveying systems have a reputation for their operational difﬁ
