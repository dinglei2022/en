## Aluminum Machining ESPI Metals
Given the high rate of chip removal,the heat generated by the machining process is taken away with the swarf without having the time to diffuse into the metal.‒ a coefficient of linear expansion that is twice that of steel makes heating undesirable if criteria of dimensional stability are to be satisfied.Unlike steel,there is noAluminium Processing SCM GroupThe multifunction ADIR C CNC machining centre with 3 interpolated axes for aluminium profiles.ADIR C completes the family of CNC machining centers from FOM Industrie.Designed for those looking for the best value entry into high performance.
