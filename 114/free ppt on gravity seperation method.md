Winnowing is the separation of the heavier particles (grains) from the lighter husk and chaff using wind or moving air The mixture,held in a basket,is thrown up in the air,wind blows the lighter particles away and the heavier grains are the caught again in the basket This process needs to be repeated several times to achieve good separationPPT Particle Separation Methods PowerPoint presentation,World's Best PowerPoint Templates CrystalGraphics offers more PowerPoint templates than anyone else in the world,with over 4 million to choose from Winner of the Standing Ovation Award for “Best PowerPoint Templates” from Presentations Magazine They'll give your presentations a professional,memorable appearance the kind of sophisticated look that today's audiences expect

Whenever I&#39m eating jelly beans I go for the green ones first.Just like the mixture of jelly beans,most substances are mixtures of things.Remember that there are two types of matter that exist: pure substances and mixtures.
