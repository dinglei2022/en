is required to obtain the accurate ball load measurement or the percentage by volume of balls in the mill.This is usually performed soon after a crash stop.The basic principle is to measure the height &#39H&#39 from the charge to the shell and the internal mill diameter &#39Di&#39.By calculating the ratio &#39H Di&#39 and using the graph below.Ball MillThe ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20
