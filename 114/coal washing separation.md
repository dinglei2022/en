The calculation of the performance of coal washing units that are in common use is not difficult and the principles of making such calculations have been known for many years.The flowsheets to be simulated consist primarily of coal washing units each with a target specific gravity of separation specified for each washing unit.The feed is alloed to each washing unit on the basis ofSpiral Concentrators Mine Engineer.ComSpiral concentrators are a gravity based concentrating device,that separates light density granular and sandy (18 mesh to 200 mesh (1 mm to 0.075 microns)) consistency material from heavier density material.In order to have a good separation,there should be a difference in SG's of at least 1.0.

## What is Coal Washing? Definition from Safeopedia
Coal washing is a process that is undertaken in a coal washery or coal preparation plant (CPP) where coal is refined or cleaned of impurities.Coal washing involves using water,mechanical techniques and relies on gravity and the difference of density between coal and it's impurities which are usually more densely packed due to the fact thatAP42,CH 11.10: Coal Cleaning EPA11.10.1 Process Description.12,9.Coal cleaning is a process by which impurities such as sulfur,ash,and rock are removed from coal to upgrade its value.Coal cleaning processes are egorized as either physical cleaning or chemical cleaning.Physical coal cleaning processes,the mechanical separation of coal from its.
