Abstract—This study was carried out to develop a flotation procedure for an oxide copper ore from a Region in Central Africa for producing an 18% copper concentrate for downstream processing at maximum recovery from a 4% copper feed grade.The copper recoveries achieved from the test work were less than 50%mining Danafloatutilizing pulp preaeration which can cause oxidation on more reactive mineral sulphide surfaces making them less floatable of course the effectiveness of this technique is dependent on the mineralization and circuit characteristics.Standard copper sulphide flotation collector reagents are sulfur based thiol class collectors

## Froth flotation Wikipedia
The flotation process is used for the separation of a large range of sulfides,carbonates and oxides prior to further refinement.Phosphates and coal are also upgraded (purified) by flotation technology.Prior to 1907,nearly all the copper mined in the US came from underground vein deposits,averaging 2.5 percent copper.Investigation of Flotation Parameters for Copper Recovery fromFeb 22,2012 the flotation behavior of other Cu and Fe sulfides such as covellite (CuS),chalcocite (Cu2S),chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) and pyrite (FeS2) are similar and require advanced studies as reported by many researchers.14 19) These researchers have shown that proper control of reduction oxidation (redox).
