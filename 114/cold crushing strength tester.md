Aug 29,2014 Cold crushing strength of a refractory material is an indiion of its suitability for use in refractory construction.(It is not a measure of performance at elevated temperature.) CCS measures the mechanical strength at room temperature.It is not indiive of mechanical strength at operating temperature.AlsoPerformance Evaluation of Refractory Bricks produced from locallyIn determining the cold crushing strength.(CCS) of the clay refractory samples,cubicle specimens were made from the clay refractory samples.The dimensions of the test pieces were taken before they were fired to the required temperature and allowed to cool to the room temperature before the tests were carried out.A.

## ASTM C133 Crush Modulus Rupture Refractories Test Equipment
ASTM C133 determines the cold crushing strength and the modulus of rupture (MOR) of dried or fired refractory shapes of all types.This test method determines room temperature flexural strength in 3point bending for cold modulus of rupture and compressive strength for cold crushing strength.This method is useful inCold Crushing Strength ReStaRThe determination of cold crushing strength (CCS) is also highly important in case of refractory insulating bricks where bricks have to be porous as well as strong.For the measurement of the CCS,according to EN 9935,a steadily increasing compressive load is applied to the refractory test piece by a compressive machine
