## Production of bioethanol by direct bioconversion of oil palm.
Production of bioethanol by direct bioconversion of oil palm industrial effluent in a stirred tank bioreactor.Authors; Authors.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of producing bioethanol from palm oil mill effluent generated by the oil palm industries through direct bioconversion process.The bioethanol&nbsp;.Improving heat transfer in stirred tanks cooled by helical coils SciELOStirred Tank Reactors are extensively used in chemical industries.When they are used for highly exothermic reactions,jackets or coils are employed for heat removal.Internal coils can be either helical or axial and they considerably affect the flow inside the reactor because they impose an additional resistance to flow
