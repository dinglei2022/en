Apr 1,2016 Compared to steel,cast iron has a lower melting point,and is more fluid and less reactive with mold materials,making it wellsuited for casting.This is a significantly less laborintensive process than making product out of wrought iron,so it was a prominent form of production throughout the 18th and 19thHow is Iron Made Into Steel? SciencingIron was the dominant metal for use in building and machinery until the modern era.Iron is still the main component of steel but when impurities are removed in the steel making process,a stronger,lighter material results (steel).Steel is used in almost all modern buildings,automobiles,aircraft and appliances.
