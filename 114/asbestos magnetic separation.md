## Clinical consequences of asbestosrelated diffuse pleural thickening
Sep 8,2008 High resolution computed tomography (CT) is more sensitive and specific than chest radiography for the diagnosis of diffuse pleural thickening,and several classifiion systems for asbestosrelated disorders have been devised.Magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emissionMesothelioma & Asbestos California Mesothelioma AsbestosIn fact,a history of asbestos exposure in the workplace is reported in approximately 70 to 80 percent of all mesothelioma cases.Asbestos Fibers Asbestos is the name for a group of naturally occurring silie minerals that can be separated into fibers.The fibers are strong,durable,and resistant to heat and fire.They are
