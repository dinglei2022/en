## Plaster of Paris Refractory ? [Archive] AlloyAvenue network
In my experience,raw plaster of paris does not melt at very high temperatures,consistent with fairly pure CaO.It doesn&#39t have appreciable structural strength,though,and it is a strong flux with a penchant for reacting with stuff (it&#39s also a fairly potent base).All in all,I wouldn&#39t advise making a furnace out ofDIY gas forge heat problem Gas Forges I Forge IronI really wish you&#39d done more and better research before going to all the trouble represented by your forge.Plaster pf Paris and sand is sometimes used as low temperature investment for casting,I&#39ve never heard of it used for a furnace liner of any kind.I don&#39t think it&#39d survive in a BBQ.Refractory it is not.
