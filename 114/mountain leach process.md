## Heap leaching Wikipedia
2019102&ensp&#0183&enspHeap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals,copper,uranium,and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and reseparate them after their division from other earth materials.Similar to in situ mining,heap leach mining differs in that it places ore on aMajor Mines &amp Projects Round Mountain Mine* DPads process ~15 Mt per year of lower grade leach material * SDed: ~275Mt,started in 1993 * WDed: ~450Mt,started in 1997 * Gold Hill: ~50Mt,started in 2012.Higher grade sulfide ore mined from the Round Mountain Pit is processed by a mill using gravity,froth flotation,and cyanide leach
