Let’s have some calculation to clear your question; For making 1 cubic meter of concrete of M25 grade,we need to mixing concrete ingradients as per mix design of M25 which is M25 ; 1; 1 ; 2 (CEMENT; SAND : AGGREGATES ) As per above ratio (M25 gra.How to Calculate Quantities of Cement,Sand and Aggregate forFeb 7,2017 A simple yet more accurate method (DLBD method) of calculating cement,sand and aggregate for Nominal Concrete mix M15,M20,M25 and M30 grade Concrete.While following a mix design is advised to optimise the material consumption,it is not possible at site to always come up with Mix design.

## What is the Ratio for M25 grade of concrete
For M25 grade concrete the seven days crushing for site condition shall be not less than 67 % of M25,i.e not less than 16.75 N mm2 But for target strength of M25 for mix design.Formula for calculating cement consumption for M20 …For nominal Mix Cement consumption for M25 will be 570 kg per cum.and for Design Mix it can be optimised to 510 kg per cum.Asked in Civil Engineering Nominal percentage of steel reinforcement in.

## mix design for m55 grade of concrete MACTFC
Concrete Mix Design As Per Indian Standard Code sand what is the difference between both mix for M40,M50,M30,M55,in high grade concrete design.Mix Design Manual 201557Economy a) Economy in cement consumption It is possible to save up to 15% of cement for M20 grade of concrete with the help ofDifferent Grades of Concrete,Their Strength and Selection …Thus,large concrete construction projects uses design mix concrete.So,suitable grade of concrete can be selected based on structural requirements.Nominal mixes for grades of concrete such as M15,M20,M25 are generally used for small scale construction.
