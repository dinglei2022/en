## Study on Utilization of Iron Ore Tailings as Fine Aggregates IJERT
Abstract In this study,M20 grade of concrete was produced &middot by complete replacing fine aggregate by Iron ore tailings,and &middot GGBS as partial substitute to cement at 10%,20%,30% and &middot 40%.The cubes were casted and their compressive strengths &middot were evaluated at 7,14 and 28 days.As the percentage &middot increased theBlast Furnace Slag Material Description User,In the production of iron,iron ore,iron scrap,and fluxes (limestone and or dolomite) are charged into a blast furnace along with coke for fuel The coke is combusted to produce carbon monoxide,which reduces the iron ore to a molten iron product,Because of their more porous structure,blast furnace slag aggregates have lower thermal.

## The Influences of Iron Ore Tailings as Fine Aggregate on the
Aug 30,2015 Abstract.The present study looks for the feasibility of preparing UHPC with iron ore tailings (IOT for short) as fine aggregate.To enhance outstanding high performances,some influences on UHPC mortars were investigated such as different kinds of sands,different mix ratio of sands,and different largestPyrite WikipediaThe mineral pyrite,or iron pyrite,also known as fool's gold,is an iron sulfide with the chemical formula FeS 2 (iron(II),Modern tests for aggregate materials certify such materials as free of pyrite Pyritised fossils This section needs additional citations for verification
