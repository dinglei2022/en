## 3 Environmental Impacts of Hydroelectric Power
We should start off by saying that there are three orders of environmental impacts of hydroelectric power.Mostly,this type of power is taken from dams placed on rivers and streams,making the dams the biggest factor in impacting the environment.In what follows,we will focus on how dams impact river ecosystems and offer more details about it.Thermal power station Wikipedia20191120&ensp&#0183&enspA thermal power station is a power station in which heat energy is converted to electric power.In most places the turbine is steamdriven.Water is heated,turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator.After it passes through the turbine the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated.This is known as a Rankine cycle.

## How do power plants work? How do we make electricity?
In a hydroelectric plant,a river is made to back up behind a huge concrete dam.The water can escape through a relatively small opening in the dam called a penstock and,as it does so,it makes one or more turbines spin around.For as long as the river flows,the turbines spin and the dam generates hydroelectric power.Willow Island Hydro: A Small but Mighty Marvel on the Ohio RiverDec 1,2017 The Willow Island hydro plant on the Ohio River is an example of innovation and collaboration ensuring a successful power generation project.HA Turbine Snags Another World Record for CCGT Efficiency.Chubu Electric&#39s NishiNagoya power plant Block1 in Japan,a plant powered by three GE 7HA
