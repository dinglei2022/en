## Coal Mining Technologies
Coal mining employs surface and underground methods to extract coal.A number of alternative Miners use heavy machinery to cut out the coal and rely on conveyor systems to transport the coal to the surface.The process involves the removal of up to 1,000 vertical feet of overburden to expose underlying coal seams.Underground Mining,Underground Mining EquipmentRetreat mining is a process that recovers the supporting coal pillars,working from the back of the mine towards the entrance,hence the word retreat.Room and pillar mining advances inward,away from the entrance of the mine.Other underground mining methods include Hard rock mining,bore hole mining,drift and fill
