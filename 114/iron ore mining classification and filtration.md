## Developments in iron ore comminution and classification,
To operate viably and sustainably,there is a need to reduce costs and energy consumption,particularly of the energy intensive grinding required for low grade magnetite deposits This chapter reviews current iron ore comminution and classification technologies and presents some examples of flowsheets from existing operationsIron ore pelletizing systems MetsoThis process generates iron ore filter cake which needs to be pelletized to be used in the steel making process Also during the processing of high grade iron ores which don’t need beneficiated,fines which are generated can be pelletized and used instead of being disposed of Iron Ore Pellets are formed from beneficiated or run of mine iron.
