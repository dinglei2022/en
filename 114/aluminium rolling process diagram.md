## The Aluminum Rolling Process: Part Two :: Total Materia Article
With regards to microstructure,hot rolling can be seen as a succession of deformation and annealing steps.The most dominant metallurgical features are recrystallization and the development of preferred crystal orientations (texture).Both processes are interrelated and influenced by ongoing precipitation.RecrystallizationAluminum Forming Effluent Guidelines Effluent Guidelines US EPADiagram of Aluminum Forming industry processes and products: tube,rod,bar,fire.Aluminum forming activities are included within the following NAICS groups: 331315: Aluminum Sheet,Plate,and Foil Manufacturing 331316: Aluminum Extruded Product Manufacturing 331319: Other Aluminum Rolling and Drawing
