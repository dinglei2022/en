## Gold cyanidation Wikipedia
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthurForrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from lowgrade ore by converting the gold to a watersoluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction.Cyanide Use in Gold Mining EarthworksHow is cyanide used in mining? A sodium cyanide solution is commonly used to leach gold from ore.There are two types of leaching: Heap leaching: In the open,cyanide solution is sprayed over huge heaps of crushed ore spread atop giant collection pads.The cyanide dissolves the gold from the ore into the solution as it trickles through the heap.

## Introduction to Cyanide Gold Mining
• Adsorption is a term used to describe the attraction of a mineral compound to the surface of another material.• Activated carbon is used to adsorb the gold out of solution.Because the cyanide ion forms very strong complexes with gold,it is the gold cyanide complex that is loaded onto the carbon rather than being deposited as metallic gold.
