## Iron Ore Mining Artifacts
98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel.Minnesota&#39s iron ore was actually discovered while prospectors were searching for gold.Since the object of their search was gold,the iron was ignored.It turned out the iron would become much more valuable to northern Minnesota than the small amount of gold found.Iron OresName,Formula,wt % Fe.Magnetite,Fe3O4,72.36.Hematite,Fe2O3,69.94.Goethite,FeO(OH),62.58.Limonite,FeO(OH) · n(H2O),52 (n = 1).Siderite,FeCO3,48.2.Bog iron,Limonite plus dirt ?

## Iron processing Britannica
Most are sedimentary,but many have been changed by weathering,and so their precise origin is difficult to determine.The most widely distributed ironbearing minerals are oxides,and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3),which is red magnetite (Fe3O4),which is black limonite or bogiron ore (2Fe2O3·3H2O),Magnetite WikipediaMagnetite is a rock mineral and one of the main iron ores.With the chemical formula Fe3O4,it is one of the oxides of iron.Magnetite is ferrimagnetic it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself.It is the most magnetic of all the naturallyoccurring minerals on Earth.
