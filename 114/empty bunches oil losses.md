## Solar Drying System for Drying Empty Fruit Bunches
201353&ensp&#0183&enspAbstract: In this paper,the drying characteristic of Empty Fruit Bunches (EFB) of oil palm is presented.The EFB,a waste of oil palm processing was used as the test sample and dried using a solar drying system that was built.The system used was comprised of six doublepass solar collectors with porous media in the second channel,which wereShortterm Changes in the Soil Physical and Chemical20101220&ensp&#0183&enspplanting oil palms on nonterraced hill slopes.Therefore,in order to reduce water and nutrient losses,several methods are used.One of them is the use of empty fruit bunches (EFB) as a natural mulching material.The beneficial effects of the EFB in improving soil properties and oil palm growth and yield have been well documented,

## Methodological issues in comparative life cycle assessment
The objectives of this paper are to provide guidelines for methodological choices that enable a systematic comparison of diverse scenarios for the treatment and valuation of empty fruit bunches (EFBs) and to explore effects of the scenarios on the environmental performances of a palm oil system.MicrowaveAssisted Alkaline Pretreatment and Microwave20131224&ensp&#0183&ensphave economic values.In the past,these products of oil palm were not effectively utilised and in many instances had caused severe pollution problems.The empty fruit bunches (EFB) are the solid residue that is produced in the highest amount from the fresh fruit bunches (FFB) of oil palm.Oil palm is the largest plantation sector in Malaysia.
