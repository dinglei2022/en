## Design of an electromagnetic mill.Its technological and control
Specified requirements for systems of grinding and classifiion,regarding the reduction of energy consumption,grinding,optimal particle size,particle shape and their surface properties showed that there is a need to design a modern fine grinding system with recirculation of grains which do not meet quality requirements.Grain Processing Beef Extensiondesign can make the roller mill useful in a very wide range of work requirements.HAMMERMILL AND ROLLER MILL.DIFFERENCES.In general,either grinder performs well with common grains including corn,grain sorghum,or wheat depending on their moisture content.However,roller mills do not grind fibrous materials
