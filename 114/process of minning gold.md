Gold is usually found alone or alloyed with mercury or silver,but can also be found in ores such as calaverite,sylvanite,nagyagite,petzite and krennerite.Most gold ore now comes from either open pit or underground mines.The ores sometimes contain as little as 5 100 of an ounce of goldGold mining WikipediaHistorically,mercury was used extensively in placer gold mining in order to form mercurygold amalgam with smaller gold particles,and thereby increase the gold recovery rates.Largescale use of mercury stopped in the 1960s.However,mercury is still used in artisanal and smallscale
