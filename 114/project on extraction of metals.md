## Metals from Regolith ISRU NASA
Since the extraction of oxygen from minerals involves splitting the oxide molecules,metals are typically coproduced in oxygen extracting technologies for ISRU.Their production is in the mineral byproducts.For these reasons,the ISRU Technology Development Project has focused on two metal extraction technologies:.Extraction of metals Iron WikiversityMay 29,2015 Reduction with carbon[edit].Iron is extracted from its ore,haematite,by reduction with carbon.This takes place in a blast furnace (named after blasts of air [20% oxygen],heated to 1000 °C,which are blasted into the bottom of the furnace): A mixture of crushed iron ore,coke (an almost pure form of carbon)

## Project overview ecometals extraction of metal with bio technology
The EcoMetals project aims at the development of innovative processes for copper (and associated metals) extraction by means of biotechnology (see box below for further information).17 partners coming from (mining and processing) industries and sciences in France,Germany and Poland collaborate in this ambitiousHow Metals are Mined Cooperative Extension Service UAFThis is a very effective process of extracting valuable minerals from the ore.Flotation.Valuable minerals concentrated by flotation cells need further processing in order to recover metals such as gold.In some cases,the next step in the process is to oxidize the ore with high pressure steam in a machine called an autoclave.
