## Lime An Introduction Climate Technology Centre &amp; Network
Lime is a remarkable and versatile material.It has a long tradition of use in construction,agriculture,water and waste treatment.More recently,lime has been used in numerous manufacturing and processing industries,most notably papermaking,sugar processing,steel production and the manufacture of calcium silicate&nbsp;.Thermal energy analysis of a lime production process: Rotary kiln.Full text (PDF) In this paper,thermal energy analysis of three zones of a lime production process,which are preheater,rotary kiln and cooler,is performed.
