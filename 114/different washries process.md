Coal Washing is a process of separation mainly based on difference in Specific Gravity of Coal and associated impurities like Shale,Sand & Stones etc so that we approved by BCCL Board for DugdaI,DugdaII,Bhojudih,Sudamdih,Moonidih & Mohuda Washeries and they are under various stages of implementation.What is Coal Washing? Definition from SafeopediaCoal washing is a process that is undertaken in a coal washery or coal preparation plant (CPP) where coal is refined or cleaned of impurities.Coal washing involves using water,mechanical techniques and relies on gravity and the difference of density between coal and it's impurities which are usually more densely packed due to the fact that
