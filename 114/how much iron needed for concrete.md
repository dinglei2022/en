## How much force does it require to tear apart steel,iron
In the link we can see that iron has a tensile strength of 350 MPa,which means that it takes a force of 350 million Newton to pull apart a one square meter thick column of iron.Concrete is listed at 25 MPa and steel between 400 and 2700 MPa.It should be noted that while concrete doesn't resist tension well,it does resist compression well.Calculating materials for your lintel BuildingCalculating materials for your lintel.Using the plan above as a sample to calculate the quantity of material needed for our concrete lintel.Due to lots of openings at the perimeter,we are going to run the lintel round the entire building as OPTION A,so to calculate the IRON RODS The additional weight won't count much but will
