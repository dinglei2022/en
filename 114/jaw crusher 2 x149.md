## Crushing technology
Jaw crushers operate according to the principle of pressure crushing.The crushing material is crushed in the wedge shaped pit between the fixed crusher jaw and the crusher jaw articulated on an eccentric shaft.The material is crushed by the elliptic course of movement and transported downwards.Jaw Crusher Working PrincipleThe Blake crusher was patented by Eli Whitney Blake in 1858.The Blake type jaw crusher has a fixed feed area and a variable discharge area.Blake crushers are of two types single toggle and double toggle jaw crushers.In the single toggle jaw crushers,the swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft which leads to a much more compact design.
