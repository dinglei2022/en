## Deep Draw Stamping Benefits Stewart EFI
Deep Draw Stamping Benefits.The benefits of utilizing the Transfer Style Press for Deep Drawn Components include: High speed production of parts with exacting tolerances.Favorable tooling costs as compared to many other manufacturing methods.Capable of drawing virtually any type of metal including some exoticDeep Drawing QimtekDeep drawing (cupping) is a manucfacturing process used to create deep,seamless och round shapes from sheet metal.When deep drawing,a tool (called a plug) punches sheet metal into a die.The sheet metal takes A rule of thumb is that when the depth exceeds the radius,deep drawing should be used.As the sheet
