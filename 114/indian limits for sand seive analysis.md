## Sieve Analysis of Soil Its Determination,Theory
(Generally sieve No.4,10,40,100,200) are used for classifying the soil.Fineness Modulus: Fineness modulus is a single factor computed from the sieve analysis and is defined as the sum of the cumulative percentages retained on the sieve of the standard series divided by 100.As per Indian standard code,is there any relation between …YES.they almost follow geometric progression.Due to large variation of sizes we have taken exponential variation.4.75,0.075mm has significance in deciding coarse aggregate and coarse grained.so they are fixed 13.2 11.2 = 11.2 9.5 2.36 0.425 =.
