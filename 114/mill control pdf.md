## MODELLING AND CONTROL OF A HOT ROLLING MILL
Abstract − In this paper,a real appliion of opti mal control of a hot rolling mill is presented.It is used the state space model formulation in the minimization of the strip thickness variations.It is presented the simulation results of the control model,which is com pared with industrial real data from process controled.Mill Behaviour of Rubber on Two Roll Mill with Temperaturemill (since termed an open roll mill) is lower than in a closed mixer (since termed an internal mixer) but that Figure 1.Drilled roll and bored roll there is a temperature distribution,the temperature.
