## Copper Mining and Extraction: Sulfide Ores
Mining copper About 200 years ago the UK was an important world source of copper and tin and there were mines in Cornwall and Devon.These mines have now closed and today the biggest copper mines are in Chile (Escondida mine) and Indonesia (Grasberg mine).These produce many millions of tonnes of copper ore per year.Separation Process of Gold Concentrate From Rocks BloggerFroth Flotation Separation flotation: Froth flotation is a separation process ore from mineral impurities by way of float ore to the surface through binding to the froth.Gravity Separation gravity separation Concentration separation by gravity methods

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores
Copper processing is a complied process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called hodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the differentInnovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & ExtractionOpen pit mining is employed when the orebodies are extensive,low in grade,and relatively near the surface,where they can be quarried after removal of overburden.Chile also boasts the The barren rock,or gangue has to be separated from the sulfide minerals in order to smelt the metallic copper from the ore.By far the

Copper,its occurrence,and use.A.What is copper? Copper is a chemical element in the periodic table with the symbol Cu (from the Latin word cuprum,meaning 'metal of Cyprus,' where it was mined during the Roman era).Copper has an atomic number of 29 and atomic weight of 63.54 grams per mole.It is an element in Group 11 of the periodic table,sharing many properties with silver and gold.Natural Sciences Grade 9 mstworkbooksOne of the methods used in underground mining is called room and pillar,and is often used for mining coal.Part of the mine is open to the surface and part of it is underground.The coal face is dug out,but pillars of coal are left behind to keep the tunnels open and support the roof.Machines called continuous miners are used to remove the coal.
