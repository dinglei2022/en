## Introduction to Mineral Processing Chevron Phillips Chemical
Froth flotation is considered to be the most widely used method for ore beneficiation.In ore beneficiation,flotation is a process in which valuable minerals are separated from worthless material or other valuable minerals by inducing them to gather in and on the surface of a froth layer.Sulfide and nonsulfide minerals as wellFroth Flotation Principles202059&ensp&#0183&enspThe Froth Flotation Machine and its operating principles are universally used for all types of flotation problems.This machine finds a wide acceptance due to its flexibility in construction,which allows the machine to be adjusted to handle pulps with divergent physical characteristics,as well as the common and intrie metallurgical problems which confront the present day operator.

## What is the gold froth flotation process?
Gold flotation process is based on the difference of physical and chemical properties of the ore surface,and is processed by flotation reagent to make the useful mineral adhere to the bubble to achieve the purpose of gold extraction.Gold Flotati.Frothers & Froth Flotation ArrMazFrothers & Froth Flotation.The importance of frothers in mineral flotation is widely acknowledged in the mining industry.Frothers perform the following key functions in the froth flotation process: Reduce surface tension of the liquid gas interface to enable froth formation; Hinder coalescence in order to stabilize bubble size
