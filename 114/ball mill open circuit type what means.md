2019 11 8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Figure 2—HPGR ball mill circuit.To determine whether the novel HPGR stirred mill circuit arrangement could achieve energy savings in comparison to conventional SAG mill based circuits,a pilot scale study was conducted to compare the energy requirements of the existing circuit at the Huckleberry mine to two alternative circuits: an HPGR ball mill circuit and a novel HPGR stirred mill circuit.The operating principle of the ball millThe operating principle of the ball mill consists of following steps.In a continuously operating ball mill,feed material fed through the central hole one of the caps into the drum and moves therealong,being exposed by grinding media.The material grinding occurs during impact falling grinding balls and abrasion the particles between the balls.Then,discharge of ground material performed.

## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles andHosokawaBall mills are giant drums that are filled to between 30 and 40% of their volume with freely moving grinding media in this case balls.The diameter of the balls is between one and several centimetres to suit the application smaller balls for fine milling results and larger ones for coarser milling tasks.
