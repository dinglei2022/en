There is no hole at 6 o&#39clock because if solids are still present in the wastewater then they could clog the holes.Determining percolation rate.One of the first steps in designing a leach field is to know how quickly the soil will absorb water,this is called a percolation rate.In figuring out the physical design of a leach field youHow Do I Unclog a Septic Leach Field Clog HogIt is often possible to clean and renew a clogged septic leach field instead of replacing the drain field lines.Consider using a sewer jetter to clean the septic leach field lines.A sewer jetter can help you scrub away sticky sludge and flush out dirty residue to help reduce the need for subsequent cleaning of the lines.Powering
