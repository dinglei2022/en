pyrite framboids and corrosion features on pyrite grains indicate partial pyrite destruction in surface sediments,and suggest that intermittent reoxidation of earlier formed iron sulfides may indeed have generated the low pH values required forRemoval of Pyrite and Different Types of Iron Sulfide Scales in OilIron Sulfide scale is a significant problem in oil and gas industry where the iron sulfide depositions have adverse impact to the production operations.Typically,iron sulfide scale formed as result of the reaction between the hydrogen sulfide and iron.Iron sulfide scale has several forms pyrrhotite (Fe7S8),troilite (FeS),pyrite

## Pyrite Mineral Uses and Properties
What is Pyrite? Pyrite is a brass yellow mineral with a bright metallic luster It has a chemical composition of iron disulfide (FeS 2) and is the most common sulfide mineralIt forms at high and low temperatures and occurs,usually in small quantities,in igneous,metamorphic,and sedimentary rocks worldwide Pyrite is so common that many geologists would consider it to be a ubiquitous mineral
