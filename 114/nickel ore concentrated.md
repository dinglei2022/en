Most of the nickel on Earth is believed to be concentrated in the planet&#39s core.Nickel is primarily sold for first use as refined metal (hode,powder,briquet,etc.) or ferronickel.About 65% of the nickel consumed in the Western World is used to make austenitic stainless steel.Another 12% goes into superalloys (e.g.InconelLateritic nickel ore deposits WikipediaLateritic nickel ore deposits are surficial,weathered rinds formed on ultramafic rocks.They account for 73% of the continental world nickel resources and will be in the future the dominant source for the mining of nickel.Contents.[hide].1 Genesis and types of nickel laterites 2 Ore deposits 3 Extraction.3.1 HPAL process

## Processing Nickel Ores
The ore is then ground to 100 mesh in ball mills.Using wet magnetic separators the magnetic ore is separated (pyrrhotite) and further reduced to 200 mesh in a ball mill.Classifiion is accomplished with screens and cyclones.The pyrrhotite is then sent to froth flotation cells,and produces a 3% nickel concentrate.Concentrate BolidenWe produce copper,lead,nickel and zinc concentrates.The biggest source of raw materials for our smelters is metal concentrates.We also use certain intermediate forms and secondary materials.We purchase some of the raw materials from mines with which we have agreements.

In the earth&#39s crust,the average concentration of nickel is about 0.0086%,and economically exploitable ore deposits contain about 13% nickel.Presently in Finland there is only one nickel mine,at Hitura on the west coast,which produces 600 000 tyear1 sulphide ores.Over 90% of the raw materials for nickel productionNickel processing BritannicaOther important classes of ore are the laterites,which are the result of long weathering of peridotite initially containing a small percentage of nickel.Weathering in subtropical climates removes a major portion of the host rock,but the contained nickel dissolves and percolates downward and may reach a concentration
