## Red Mud as an Additional Source of Titanium Raw Materials
In this study the extraction of titanium from bauxite residue (red mud) with 2 step acid leaching was proposed.In the first step red mud was leached with diluted hydrochloric acid under stirring to remove the soluble Ca,Na,Al,Si and K at 25∘C and pH=3 for 1 hour.The content of iron and titanium in the solid residuePhysical and Chemical Properties of Sintering Red Mud and MDPIOct 9,2012 in Figure 1 (Bayer red mud often suffers an early pressure filtration progress before discharged).The site maps show that,with the same stocking years,Bayer red mud has large water content (the value tested in laboratory is 52.3%) and is in a plasticstreaming state.While the Sintering red mud contains
