## Magnetite Facts &amp Figures The Magnetite Network
The main iron mineral in magnetite ore is the ferrous iron oxide magnetite (Fe 3 O 4).Magnetite ore requires complex processing to separate magnetite minerals from other minerals in the ore to produce an almost pure magnetite concentrate with an iron content of between 68% Fe and 70% Fe that is highly sought after by steel makers.What Is Iron Ore Beneficiation? (with pictures) wisegeekJun 30,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Iron ore mining often focuses on looking for hematite deposits known as red iron ore,and magnetite,as they have naturally weak magnetic fields that aid in their purifiion.Hematite,however,responds better to the flotation process in iron ore beneficiation than magnetite,so it is the preferred type of ore.
