## Separation of Tin,Silver and Copper from Waste Pbfree Solder
Nov 8,2014 The waste lead (Pb)free solder leaching process in hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) followed by separation of copper (Cu) and tin (Sn) was investigated to separate tin,silver (Ag),and copper as an individual component from waste Pbfree solder.The dissolution of SnTENORM: Copper Mining and Production Wastes RadiationSmelting: Then,copper concentrates are mixed with silica (sand) and limestone and heated in a furnace to form two naturallyseparating layers.One layer is a waste containing iron and silica compounds and is discarded as slag slagByproduct left after a desired metal is thermally separated from its raw ore.Approximately 75 percent of the
