Methods of extraction Many metals are found in the Earth&#39s crust as ores.An ore is usually a compound of the metal mixed with impurities.When the metal is dug up,a method must be used to separate the metal from the rest of the ore.This is called extracting the metal.The method of extraction depends on how reactive theWays to Separate Metal From Ore SciencingJan 9,2018 The process of separating a metal from its ore is known as smelting.Smelting is Ancient civilizations,such as the Inca and the Greeks,used primitive techniques to separate ore and metal.A crucible (usually made out of graphite or clay) is used to dip into the smelter to extract molten metal and ore.
