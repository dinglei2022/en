## Plating C14500 tellurium copper Finishing
We have designed a fitting that is to be produced in C14500 tellurium copper,because of its leadfree composition and good machinability,scheduled for bright silver plating as the final surface finish.I have the general impression that some of the freemachining alloys can create problems with the plating process and as aTellurium chemical element BritannicaTellurium is a silvery white element with properties intermediate between those of metals and nonmetals it makes up approximately one part per billion of Earth&#39s crust.Like selenium,it is less often found uncombined than as compounds of metals such as copper,lead,silver,or gold and is obtained chiefly as a byproduct of

## Facts About Tellurium Live Science
Jun 12,2013 Tellurium is often used to improve the machinability of copper and stainless steel.It&#39s used to make blasting caps,added to cast iron and used in ceramics.Adding tellurium to lead improves the strength and hardness of the metal and decreases corrosion.Many thermoelectric devices are made with bismuthExtraction of tellurium from lead and copper bearing feed materialsThe main sources of tellurium in the lead smelting process are copper dross (mass of solid impurities floating on a molten metal),alkaline skimming and rich sliver dross intermediate products (Chizhikov and Shchastlivyi,1970 Smirnov,1977 Davey,1980 Margulis and Zaitsev,1985).Tellurium accumulates in these
