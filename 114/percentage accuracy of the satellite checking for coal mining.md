## 100 innovations in the mining industry Ontario Mining Association
Mineral exploration requires the accurate,reliable,and rapid analysis of rocks and minerals (expressed as percentages or as grams of metal per metric ton of rock).Advances in the 1990s in the field of spectrometric analysis led to the development of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,which can simultaneouslyVENTILATION PLANNING LAYOUTS FOR LARGE OPENINGof the main mine fan's airflow to the last open crosscuts near the active working faces.This is accomplished by the use of a continuous stopping line that is installed from the portals to the active faces.The stopping line is developed parallel to the VENTILATION PLANNING LAYOUTS FOR LARGE OPENING MINES
