## What is the difference between Cadmium & Zinc Plating Finishing
A.Cadmium and zinc are two different elements which have many similar properties but some very different properties.A couple or three decades ago platings of the two metals were used pretty much interchangeably on noncritical hardware because they provide generally similar corrosion protection through the sameWhat is the difference between Cadmium &amp; Zinc PlatingWhen it was recognized that cadmium is a chronic cumulative poison similar to lead and mercury in its effects,cadmium gradually became restricted to use only on those applications where its unique combination of properties could not be met by zinc plating or a zinc alloy plating.
