## Zinc: smelting,producing and classification Metalpedia
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc The most common zinc concentrate processed is zinc sulfide,which is obtained by concentrating sphalerite using the froth flotation methodThere are two methods of smelting zinc: the pyrometallurgical process and the hydrometallurgical process (over 90% of hydrometallurgical,Selective extractions of Zn and Cd from ZnCdCo Science Directhydrometallurgy.Selective extractions of Zn and Cd from.ZnCdCoNi sulphate solution using di2ethylhexyl phosphoric acid extractant.George Owusu.Hudson These values indie the ease of separation of these metals under appropriate condi tions.extraction has become an important hydrometallurgical tool.

## Separation of Cadmium from Solutions Containing High
In hydrometallurgical process of extracting cadmium as a by product,zinc dust is added for separation of cadmium as cadmium sponge.High amounts of zinc are quite often noticed in the cadmium electrolyte subjected for electrowin ning of the metal.This leads to poor quality of cadmium deposit and lower.2016110&ensp&#0183&enspOptimization of Ag Fe Separation Flowsheet for Reclamation of Hydrometallurgical Zinc Residue LIU Anrong 1,WANG Zaiqian 2,YAO Hualong 2,WANG Zhenjie 1,NIE Dengpan 1,ZHU Mingyan 1 1.Chemical and Metallurgy Institute of Guizhou,Guiyang
