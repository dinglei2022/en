## How to calculate the 1:1:2 ratio of concrete cement,including
Mix ratio of M25 grade is 1:1:2 (cement:sand:coarse aggregates) Formula for calculating quantity of cement is,cement = (dry volume of the concrete x cement ratio) (sum of the ratio) here,Dry volume of concrete = wet volume of concrete x 1.54 wetMECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF HEAVY WEIGHT IJRETThe concrete mix as per IS10262(2009) is used for M25 and M35 grades of concrete and in this only coarse aggregate is Watercement ratio as per grade of for the high density iron ore.Heavy weight iron ore is used as the main ingredient of the high density concrete mix for concrete coating of submerged marine.
