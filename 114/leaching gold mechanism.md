## US7025942B2 Control of lead nitrate addition in gold recovery
A method for controlling the extraction of gold from a gold ore by the cyanidation process in which a leaching step including the addition of a lead compound,which is typically lead nitrate or other lead salt,is used.In order to maintain stable conditions in the leaching process,and to use the leaching reagents efficiently,A REVIEW OF GOLD LEACHING IN ACID THIOUREA SOLUTIONSSince the initial report of thiourea as a complexing reagent for gold leaching,considerable research has been directed toward the use of thiourea as an alternative to cyanide for gold extraction.In another aspect,the mechanisms of gold surface passivation and thiourea decomposition consumption still remain uncertain.
