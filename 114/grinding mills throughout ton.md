## Raymond Mill Raymond Mill Working Principle
Under ideal working conditions,Raymond Mill consumes less energy than other ordinary grinding mills For example,the MTM Medium speed Grinding Mill only consumes 102kW h when yielding a ton of materials and 148kW h when feeding a ton of materials Its electricity consumption is lower than that of ball mill at the same level by over 60%Cement grinding Vertical roller mills versus ball millsCement grinding Vertical roller mills versus ball mills Soeren Worre Joergensen MSc,General Manager,Engineering,Grinding Technology.80 years it was the predominant mill for grinding of raw materials and coal,and still.Another consequence is a general increase of the strength during the hardening of the cement.However,too high.

## Maize milling
The best quality maize meal is therefore obtained by: De germinating the maize prior to milling Milling with rollers rather than hammer mills or plate mills disc mills.Alternatively,if the budget is small,the whole maize,after cleaning and conditioning,may be milled by means of the plate mill only and then sifted (without de germination).Value of Grinding Grains and Roughages for Livestocka combination mill,commonly called a re cutter,equipped with spiral knives and 12 inch burrs.an average cost figure of $2.48 per ton for grinding alfalfa hay and $1.96 per ton for grinding bundle corn fodder.The same make and size of grinder was used as that used in this work and.or six days during the year,while if the same.
