## CHARACTERISATION OF OCHREOUS AND VITREOUS GOETHITE
The development of a spectral index related to the width of the CFA900 provides a way of discriminating between ochreous and vitreous goethite.HRXCT offers threedimensional (3D) characterisationLimonite Mineral Information,photos and FactsLimonite Mineral Facts: Chemical Formula: Fe4O3(OH)6.Hydrated oxide of iron,often impure.The analyses of limonite range between wide limits,largely because of the great quantities of impurities mixed with it.The principal impurities are clay,sand,phosphates,silica,manganese compounds and organic matter.

## Goethite mineral Britannica
Goethite varies in colour from yellowbrown to red.It is composed of about 80 to 90 percent Fe 2 O 3 and approximately 10 percent water.When dehydrated,goethite forms hematite upon hydration,goethite becomes limonite.For detailed physical properties,see oxide mineral (table).some rockmagnetic parameters for natural goethite,pyrrhotite andpoorly known for goethite and pyrrhotite as well as for finegrained hematite.Data of hematite Oifferences in crystallite size and sUbstitution between the goethites give rise to differences in the asynmetrically.Harms J.L,Morgan B.D.1964,Pisolithlc limonite deposits in North·West Australia,Proc.Australas.Ins!.Min.

moderate,but saprolite contains more of it than limonite sample.However,Fe content in saprolieteis much lower than limonite,about 10% difference.Analysis of XRD pattern (Fig.1) Goethite (FeOOH),Lizardite.(Mg3(Si2O5)(OH)4),Clinochlorite((Mg,Fe2+)5Al(AlSi3O10)(OH)8),and Quartz (SiO2) are the major phases in the.
