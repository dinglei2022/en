## Life cycle cost estimation and environmental valuation of coal mine
Mining companies commonly conduct financial analysis at the beginning of a project,i.e.at the planning stage.Life cycle costing (LCC) and environmental valuation are two commonly used tools to assess various options necessary for mining operations including mine tailings disposal,processing technology,and powerMine Waste and Tailings 2018 PDF AusIMMThe Mine Waste and Tailings Stewardship Conference 2018 was held from 23 24 July in Brisbane,Queensland.The second in this series it aimed to be the benchmark for sharing knowledge and experience on mine waste and tailings management,sustainable practice and closure in Australia and the rest of the world.
