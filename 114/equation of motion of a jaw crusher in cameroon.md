## Analysis of the Single Toggle Jaw Crusher Force
Today,the most commonly used types of jaw crusher are the single toggle and the double toggle designs.The original double toggle jaw crusher was designed by Eli Whitney Blake in the USA in 1857.The motion of the swing jaw in a double toggle crusher is such that it applies an almost purely compressive force upon the material being crushed.Research Article Analysis of the Single Toggle Jaw CrusherAnalysis of the Single Toggle Jaw Crusher Force Transmission Characteristics jaw crusher,that may be attributed to the structure of the Equation can be used to determine values of 3 for any givenvalueof 2,which represents the input motion.

Jaw crushers are used as primary crushers,or the first step in the process of reducing rock.They crush primarily by using compression.The rock is dropped between two rigid pieces of metal,one of which then moves inwards towards the rock,and the rock is crushed because it has a lower breaking point than the opposing metal piece.“Computer Aided Design of Jaw crusher”Jaw crusher movement is guided by pivoting one end of the swinging jaw.and an eccentric motion located at the opposite end.[4] The size of a jaw crusher is designated by the rectangular or square opening at the top of the jaws.For instance,a 22 x 30 jaw crusher has an opening of 22&quot; by 30&quot;,

Predictions for five types of crushers: jaw crusher,cone crusher,gyratory crusher,impact crusher and double roll crusher are presented.The breakage method used is based on facture of particles using geometric rules for progeny generation and estimates of the force applied to the particles as they flow through the crusher.Comparison between bond crushing energy and fracture.determine the applied energy in a jaw crusher,a PFC3D model of a jaw crusher was developed.This model is a single macro particle simulation in a crusher,and multi body interactions are ignored.The crushing process for a single cubic and or a single spherical rock in the jaw crusher is simulated using the PFC3D model.
