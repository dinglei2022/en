## What Are the Benefits of Mining? Research Summary
Mining is the practice of extracting ore,coal,clays,soils,or minerals from the ground for the purpose of using them Mines have existed for thousands of years In ancient times mines consisted of short tunnels dug into the sides of hills or mountains where veins of metals,minerals,or coal had been discovered on the surfaceSelective attachment processes in ancient gold ore beneficiation1,primary deposits contain submicroscopic and nanogold in varying concentrations.Surrounding the primary deposits,secondary nanogold also can derive from the biomineralization of solubilized gold (see Section 3.3).Nanogold is characterized by high chemical activity and is used in many modern nanotechnology
