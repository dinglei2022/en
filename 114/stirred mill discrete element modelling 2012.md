## Investigating grinding media dynamics inside a vertical.
In this work the grinding media motion inside a vertical stirred mill was investigated using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and the results were qualitatively compared against similar conditions from published literature.Two impeller designs having different arm length were investigated as function of low and high rotational speeds (50 rpm and 250 rpm).A novel approach for modelling of physical interactions.In paper E,coupled nite element,DEM andPFEM models are used to model the physical interactions of grinding media,slurry andmill structure and in a stirred media mill.The ndings in the present thesis support theestablishment of particle based numerical method

## DEM simulation and analysis of operating parameters on,
DEM (Discrete Element Method) is a powerful tool in predicting particle behaviour,which is ideal for the study of stirred media milling The CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) is used to model the motion of slurry by numerically solving the Navier Stokes equations facilitated with the Volume of Fluid (VOF) and multiphase flow modelsDiscrete Particle Simulation of Particle Flow in a Stirred.Particle flow in a stirred mill was modeled using discrete element method,focusing on the effect of mill properties and stirrer configurations,such as particle wall friction,the size of disc holes,distance between stirrers,and stirrer shape,on the flow properties of grinding media.The flow properties were analyzed in terms of velocity field,porosity distribution,collision frequency.
