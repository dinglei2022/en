## Limestone and Dolomite Ohio History Central
Ohio has an abundance of limestone and dolomite (collectively referred to as carbonate rocks) and has long been an important producer of these sedimentary rocks.Both rock types have a high percentage of calcium carbonate (the mineral calcite) but dolomite has a significant percentage of magnesium.These rocksDolomite WikipediaWhere calcite limestone is uncommon or too costly,dolomite is sometimes used in its place as a flux for the smelting of iron and steel.Large quantities of processed dolomite are used in the production of float glass.In horticulture,dolomite and dolomitic limestone are added to soils and soilless potting mixes as a pH buffer
