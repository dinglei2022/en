## A history of gravity separation at Richards Bay Minerals SAIMM
industry evolved,Richards Bay Minerals also evolved in their use and approach to gravity separation.This paper discusses the history of gravity separation at Richards Bay Minerals and briefly comments concentrator and mineral separation plant commenced.gravity separation units tested at the operations pilot plant.Pilot Plant and Mineral Processing LaboratoryThe pilot plant allows study of many aspects of ore handling and concentration,including crushing,grinding,classifiion,gravity separation,dense media separation and magnetic separation,foam flotation and dewatering.As each aspect of beneficiation is optimized,it is incorporated into an efficient overall process.
