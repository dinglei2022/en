## Fire clay Wikipedia
Fire clays consist of natural argillaceous materials,mostly Kaolinite group clays,along with finegrained micas and quartz,and may also contain organic matter and sulphur compounds.Fire clay is resistant to high temperatures,having fusion points higher than 1,600 °C (2,910 °F),therefore it is suitable for lining furnaces,
