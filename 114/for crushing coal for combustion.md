## Coal combustion efficiency SourceWatch
May 1,2015 In fluidized bed plants,coal is burned with air in a circulating bed,typically made of crushed coal combined with limestone The advantage of this technology is that it is suited to a wide variety of coals and nocoal fuels such as biomass.An advantage of CFB technology is that it favors low NOx formation andSpace Requirement for the Combustion of Pulverized CoalULVERIZED coal firing has reached a high stage of development as an art,but has not so far yielded to quantitative analysis because of the lack both of adequate quantitative descriptions of crushed material and of adequate industrial data.Some experimental data have been accumu lated,dealing with the combustion of
