## Silica Sand Mining EIS Meeting Wisconsin DNR
Silica Sand Mining in Wisconsin.1.0 Introduction.Sand mining has occurred in Wisconsin for hundreds of years however,recently there has been a dramatic increase in the number of mining proposals.This increase is attributed to a surge in hydrofracking,a technique used by the petroleum industry to extract natural gasWhat is Frac Sand? A Durable Sand for Hydraulic Fracturing"Frac sand" is a high purity quartz sand with very durable and very round grains.It is a crush resistant material produced for use by the petroleum industry.These are centrally located to several mines and the sand is delivered by truck,train,or conveyer.
