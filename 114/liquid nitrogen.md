## Questions and Answers How cold is liquid nitrogen?
How cold is liquid nitrogen? Under normal atmospheric pressure,nitrogen can exist as a liquid between the temperatures of 63 K and 77.2 K (346°F and 320.44°F).Below 63 K,nitrogen freezes and becomes a solid.Above 77.2 K,nitrogen boils and becomes a gas.Since it is obtained from the atmosphere,liquid nitrogenInformation about Liquid nitrogen show with Fizzics Eduion KidsStudents have the opportunity to assist in the many cool liquid nitrogen demonstrations during this interactive science show.Find out how solids,liquids and gases change when rapidly heated and cooled.Smash a squash ball!
