## Primary Production The Aluminum Association
Primary production is the process through which new aluminum is made (versus secondary production,in which existing aluminum is recycled into pure metal).Aluminum originates from bauxite,an ore typically found in the topsoil of various tropical and subtropical regions.Once mined,aluminum within the bauxite ore isThe aluminium production process European AluminiumPure aluminium oxide,called alumina,is extracted from bauxite via a process called refining,composed of two steps: a digestion process,using caustic soda,which allows the separation of aluminium hydroxide from the so called “bauxite residue”,followed by a calcination step which removes the water content in the hydroxide.
