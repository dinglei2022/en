## determining dynamic belt tensions using Semantic Scholar
tension at arbitrary points along the conveyor is not a simple task.A finite element program developed at The University of Newcastle can accept belt velocity at any number of points along the conveyor as program inputs.Using this feature measured belt velocities can be used to determine the dynamic tensions at any pointA riddle was proposed on the Neal Boortz show today: If an airplane is on a large conveyor belt and is trying to take off by exerting the thrust needed to move it.
