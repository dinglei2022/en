The difference between cement and mortar is that cement is the binding agent,whereas mortar is a product composed of cement,sand and lime.Both these substances have distinct purposes,such as cement is activated with water and forms a bond with other elements to form one solid object,whereas mortar is useful for holding bricks or stone together,and cannot stand alone like concrete.ONLINE CIVIL ENGINEERING: Precast and prestressed …In the case of conventionally designed reinforced concrete beams,significant savings in materials can also be realized by precasting and prestressing techniques.For example,a precast and prestressed beam spaced at 4 m (13 ft) on centers and spanning 12 m (39 ft) and designed to support a load of 4 kPa (83.6 lb ft2) can result in a saving of 60.8% in concrete and 66% in steel quantities over.
