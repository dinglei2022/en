Feldspar grows (when allowed to) into rectangular crystals,and then usually breaks the same way.This breakage pattern is called cleavage,and feldspar has two directions of cleavage that meet at close to a 90 degree angle (just like a stairway).Igneous phenocrystic origin of Kfeldspar GeoScienceWorldApr 1,2008 Study of four Kfeldspar megacrystic granitic plutons and related dikes in the Sierra Nevada composite batholith indies that the megacrysts are phenocrysts that grew in contact with granitic melt.Growth to megacrystic sizes was due to repeated replenishment of the magma bodies by fresh granitic melt
