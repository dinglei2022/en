## Chemical Reaction Stoichiometry (CRS): A Tutorial
The term “chemical reaction” includes not only a chemical transforma tion,but also a phase change such as the vaporization of water We are thus concerned with the stoichiometry of both single and multiphase systems 22 Why is CRS important? Chemical reaction stoichiometry is an essential consideration in any situaChemical Reaction Stoichiometry (CRS): A TutorialChemical reaction stoichiometry (CRS) is a branch of chemical stoichiome try dealing with the constraints,in the form of chemical equations,placed on changes in the composition of a closed reacting system by the require ment for conservation of the amount of,
