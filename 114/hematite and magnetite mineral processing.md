## The Study of Pelletizing of Mixed Hematite and Magnetite Ores
The present study aims to investigate the use of mixed hematite and magnetite ores in iron ore pellet production Pelletizing tests were carried out on the hematite and magnetite,Comminution behavior and mineral liberation,quartz and other gangue minerals (Yu et al,2017) Therefore,low grade hematite ores must be treated by mineral processing methods (eg,flotation and magnetic separation) to obtain the iron concentrate Prior to separation,the iron minerals must be liberated from the gangue minerals through comminution.
