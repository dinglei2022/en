## physical chemistry Why is Charcoal such an excellent adsorbent
Activated carbon is commonly used to absorb organics,that should bind well on coal.For many purposes,activated Charcoal isn&#39t a particularly good adsorbent even though it is chemically very similar to activated carbon.Activated carbon is Charcoal is used in the gold mining processing industry.The gold(and otherUSE OF ACTIVATED CARBON FOR MINE WATER TREATMENTI sible without the use of costly oxidants and precipitating agents.achieved by alytic oxidation in an activated carbonair+nine water system.ferrous iron content of an acid mine water flowing through aspirated,granular,activated carbon was reduced from about 700 t o 10 ppm in less than 1 minute.corporating a alytic
