AmericanThe impoundments associated with some of the largest mills,such as at open pit copper mines,can cover thousands of acres (tens of km2) and be several hundred feet (about 100 m) thick.Heap leach piles can cover tens to hundreds of acres (0.1 to 1 km2) and be a few hundred feet (about 100 m) high.They resemble

## Seafloor copper extraction better than traditional mining — report
Jun 1,2015 Based on the analysis of each mine&#39s social and environmental impacts,the research concluded that seafloor mining has the potential to not only provide economic benefits within the communities nearest to the operations,but also to minimize the impact of copper mining.According to Nautilus Minerals,the&quot The Chilean copper industry towards a more ecologically durableecological impact of Chile&#39s copper mines? If we want to formulate an answer to this question,we need to map out the different ecological impacts over the years.This brings us to a first sub question: What different ecological impacts did the copper mines have on their environment? This question implies that we learn about

## Environmental Impacts of Metal Ore Mining and CiteSeerX
The impact of mining and smelting of metal ores on environmental quality is described.Mines produce large amounts of waste because the ore is only a small fraction of the total volume of the mined material.In the metal industry,production of Cu,Pb,and Zn causes the greatest degradation of the environment.CopperThe Effects of Copper Mining on Environment and SocietyBoom,Bust,Boom (First Schaffner Press,2013),by Bill Carter,explores the presence of copper in our lives and its potential cost on our health,economy,and our environment.The following excerpt,from the first chapter &quotTainted Vegetables,&quot recounts the author&#39s personal experience with the effects of copper mining after

## Environmental Aspects of Copper Production Princeton University
Copper production is not an environmentally benign activity.From mining and milling through hydro and pyrometallurgical processing to refin ing,copper production can have significant ad verse impacts on air quality,surface and ground water quality,and the land (see figure 81 ).While these impacts can be severeCopper production & environmental impact GreenSpecThe US Geological Survey estimated that,as of 2013,there remained 3.5 billion metric tons of undiscovered copper resources worldwide in porphyry and sedimenthosted type deposits,two types which currently provide 80% of mined copper production.This was in addition to 2.1 billion metric tons of identified resources.
