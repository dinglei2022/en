## Heavy metals input with phosphate fertilizers used in Argentina.NCBI
Conventional inorganic phosphorus fertilizers may cause an inadvertent addition of heavy metals,which are contained as impurities.Fertilizers commonly used in Argentina were analyzed to determine concentrations of chromium,cadmium,copper,zinc,nickel and lead.Rock phosphate contained the highest levels ofRole of rock phosphate in alleviation of heavy metals stress onHeavy metals (HM),especially cadmium,man ganese and zinc,are released into the environment during agricultural and industrial activities,and may pose a serious threat to the environment and influence the biodegradation in soil (Burkhardt et al.1993) and plant growth.Manganese and zinc are essential micronutrients.
