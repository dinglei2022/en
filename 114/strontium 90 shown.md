## Strontium 90 Revolvy
The radioactive decay of strontium 90 generates a significant amount of heat,0.536 W g in the form of pure strontium metal or approximately 0.256 W g as strontium titanate [17] and is cheaper than the alternative 238 Pu.It is used as a heat source in many Russian Soviet radioisotope thermoelectric generators,usually in the form of strontium titanate.[18]Simulating the Transfer of Strontium90 from Soil to LeafyThe transfer,from soil to Chinese cabbage and spinach,of radioactive strontium90 released as a result of accidents in nuclear power stations was studied using and roots of Chinese cabbage were not exactly the same,all showed a nonlinear increase when compared with the increase in the content of strontium in soil.
