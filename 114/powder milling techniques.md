## High energy ball milling process for nanomaterial synthesis
The alloying process can be carried out using different apparatus,namely,attritor,planetary mill or a horizontal ball mill.However,the principles of these operations are same for all the techniques.Since the powders are cold welded and fractured during mechanical alloying,it is critical to establish a balance between theWet and Dry Media Milling Techniques from Hosokawa AZoNanoIn this webinar Dr.Juergen Stein,R & D Manager from Hosokawa discusses wet and dry media milling techniques for size reduction of powders to submicron level.
