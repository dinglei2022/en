## Potassium Element information,properties and uses
Most potassium minerals are found in igneous rocks and are sparingly soluble.The metal is difficult to obtain from these minerals.There are,however,other minerals such as sylvite (potassium chloride),sylvinite (a mixture of potassium and sodium chloride) and carnallite (potassium magnesium chloride) that are found in deposits formed by evaporation of old seas or lakes.WebElements Periodic Table &#187 Potassium &#187 the essentialsPotassium is an essential constituent for plant growth and it is found in most soils.It is also a vital element in the human diet.Potassium is never found free in nature,but is obtained by electrolysis of the chloride or hydroxide,much in the same manner as prepared by Davy.
