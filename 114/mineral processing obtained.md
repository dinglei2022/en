## Introduction to Mineral Processing Course
Mineral processing is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.Although the primary operations are comminution and concentration,but there are other important operations in a modern mineral processing plant,Mineral Process Flow General KinematicsJan 17,2018 Processes for extracting ore with monetary value have been found in human history as far back as the year 973.Mineral Processing is defined as: "crushing and separating ore into valuable substances or waste by any of a variety of techniques".The process goal is to obtain the purest form of the targeted
