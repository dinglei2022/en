## Antimony Minerals Eduion Coalition
A native element,antimony metal is extracted primarily from stibnite,which contains 72 percent antimony and 28 percent sulfur.Stibnite is mined in only a few countries,with China being its largest producer.Antimony is used for many technological and industrial purposes.Antimony is used as a hardening alloy for.Antimony Recovery from EndofLife Products and Industrial Processtions,the average recovery ratio of antimony reached.92.88 %.Also of interest,are the efforts to recover anti mony from a lowgrade or complex stibnite ore,as well as from secondary antimony minerals.Yang and Wu [16] developed a new hydrometallurgical process to recover antimony from complex stibnite concentrate.
