Calculation of reduction ratio in crushing [image: (13553)] Crushing Equipment The selection of the right crushing equipment is influenced by many factors some of which are upstream of the crushing plant (e.g.blasting pattern and mining method) and others which are downstream of the crushing plant (e.g.mill and grinding circuit selection).Crushing for particle shape Aggregates ManagerNov 17,2014 Some operations may finish the product at the secondary stage,but most will require at least three stages of crushing.Closing the circuit at the third or fourth stage also will help to refine particle shape because it allows for crushing at a lower reduction ratio,which improves shape.To a degree,geology
