Nature of Gold: The surface of a gold particle will typically be dissolved at a rate of around 0.20.5 &#181m of surface depth per hour in a cyanide leach.For large gold particles and nuggets,this is too slow to be fully dissolved in a typical processing plant.Much simpler and less expensive gravity methods are available to recover this gold.Gravity Concentration GekkoGravity concentration is the separation of minerals based on differences in specific gravity.A gravity concentration process is designed to recover very high grades of valuable ore material into very small masses.The resurgence of gravity concentration in mining has come about due to its simplicity and low environmental
