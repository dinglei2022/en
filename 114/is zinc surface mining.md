Most zinc mines are underground operations.The zinc ore is blasted,scooped up by frontend loaders,taken in large trucks to underground crushers,then hoisted to the surface up one of the shafts.At the surface,the ore is crushed further and subjected to the froth flotation method,then heated and treated in other ways toZinc Rock Files Australian Mines AtlasThese deposits formed the basis of Australia&#39s zinc mining industry.Exposed deposits are becoming harder to find in Australia and exploration companies are currently looking beneath the surface for the deposits of the future which is a more costly and difficult way to find orebodies.However,there have been a series of
