## Graphite: A mineral with extreme properties and many uses
Most of the graphite seen at Earth&#39s surface today was formed at convergent plate boundaries where organicrich shales and limestones were subjected to the heat crushed to a particle size that liberates the graphite flakes,and processed by specific gravity separation or froth flotation to remove the lowdensity graphite.Basics in Minerals Processing MetsoClassifiion.Enrichment.5.Washing.Gravity separation.Flotation.Magnetic separation.Leaching.Upgrading.6.Sedimentation.Mechanical dewatering.Thermal drying.Thermal processing.Materials handling 3:40.Pulverizing of coal.of the Stone Age man to the uranium ores of Atomic Age".The ambition with this

## PreConcentration of Vanadium from Stone Coal by Gravity MDPI
Aug 4,2016 Due to the low grade of V2O5 in stone coal,the existing vanadium extraction technologies face challenges in terms of large handling capacity,high acid consumption and production cost.The preconcentration of vanadium from stone coal before the extraction process is an effective method to reduce cost.PreConcentration of Vanadium from Stone Coal by Gravity MDPIAug 4,2016 In this study,detailed mineral characterization of stone coal was investigated.It has been confirmed that the vanadium mainly occurs in muscovite and illite.A significant demand for an effective preconcentration process with simple manipulation for discarding quartz and other gangue minerals is expected.
