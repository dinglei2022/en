## Removing Cobalt From Machine Coolant Carbide Processors
Removing Cobalt (free & chelated) From Saw Grinding Coolant Removes 11.5 grams Liter (1.6 oz. gal.) Background: Coolants typically dissolve the cobalt matrix out of tungsten carbide during saw sharpening.This situation can be greatly improved by Maintain coolant flow throughout machine.Allow 30 minutes forHard metal lung disease: importance of cobalt in coolants ThoraxABSTRACT Four patients were found to react to occupational exposure to grinding of hard in the part of the factory where air concentrations of cobalt were the lowest.The cobalt there is dissolved in the coolant necessary for grinding the hard metal.It occurs.but marked reduction in peak expiratory flow rate.(fig 3).
