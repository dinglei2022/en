## Ionic Liquid Screen Hampton Research
Ionic liquids can demonstrate a degree of localized structuring about each ion compared to materials composed of disassociated ions,setting them apart from salt solutions.56 Ionic liquids can participate in ionic,hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions.Ionic liquids are often chaotropic,composed of low symmetryHydrophobic ionic liquids with strongly coordinating anionsw Liriasin a crystal lattice is disfavored and the coulombic interactions between the ions and the anions are of limited strength.A feature of ionic liquids with weakly coordinating anions is that metal salts are poorly soluble in them,which is a disadvantage for appliions like the electrodeposition of metals.A solution to this
