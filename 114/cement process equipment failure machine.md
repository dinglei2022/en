out the entire construction process to ensure that the hardened concrete actually has the desired properties.When a blemish appears on the surface of a concrete slab it will likely be one of these: blisters,cracking,crazing,curling,delamination,discoloration,dusting,efflorescence,low spots,popouts,scaling,or spalling.Machinery Foundation Grouting assets.masterbuildersotating equipment and heavy machinery cannot simply be installed on a concrete foundation since irregularities in both the machine base and concrete surface will create loadbearing issues and alignment difficulties.Additionally,a concrete foundation is not tough mature wear or failure of bearings and other rotating parts.

## Common Causes of Machine Failures
Machines fail for a variety of reasons.Likewise,not all failures are the same.The term &quotmachinery failure&quot or &quotmalfunction&quot usually implies that the machine has stopped functioning the way in which it was intended or designed.This is referred to as "loss of usefulness" of the machine or component.Root Cause Analysis Examples in Manufacturing Industry 4,A prime example of automated root cause analysis would be to look at how machine learning can be utilized to deduce the root cause of asset failure and quality deviations in manufacturing We can look at a manufacturing process as consisting of: an input stage in process manufacturing,feeding the raw materials into the production line;
