## Manganese Wikipedia
A more progressive extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore in a heap leach.This is done by percolating natural gas through the bottom of the heap the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850 °C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide).This reduces all of the manganese ore toSulfuric acid leaching of ocean manganese nodules using phenolsThe results indied that all the tested phenols were effective reducing agents that significantly increased the extraction of Mn,Cu,Ni,Co from the nodules.At a dosage of 0.25 ∼ 0.4 grams J.P.Allen,H.L.Abercrombie,D.A.RiceLeaching and recovery of metals from cobaltrich manganese crust.Minerals & Metallurgical
