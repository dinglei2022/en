## Alloy Wikipedia
An alloy is a mixture of metals or a mixture of a metal and another element.Alloys are defined by a metallic bonding character.An alloy may be a solid solution of metal elements (a single phase) or a mixture of metallic phases (two or more solutions).Intermetallic compounds are alloys with a defined stoichiometry andMetals of antiquity WikipediaThe metals of antiquity are the seven metals which humans had identified and found use for in prehistoric times: gold,silver,copper,tin,lead,iron,and mercury.These seven are the metals from which the modern world was forged until the discovery of arsenic in the 13th century,these were the only known elemental metals
