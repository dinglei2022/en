## Role of oxygen in wetting of copper nanoparticles on silicon
However,oxidation plays an important role in thermal evolution of the copper thin film.The formation of oxide impedes the agglomeration of copper film during thermal annealing [32].It is also observed that when the substrate or the Cu film is exposed to air,the agglomeration is hindered [34].Such retardation in copperCopper and Copper Oxides Knowledge Base NanomaterialsIn most cases these effects are the result of exposure to very high doses of this metal and also to a higher bioavailability of copper with copper ions being released from copper oxide.However,copper is an essential trace element for the normal function of many tissues,including the nervous system,immune system,heart,
