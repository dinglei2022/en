## The Properties of Slag Cement and its Influence on the Structure of
A ground blastfurnace granulated slag used in the production of construction materials and items differs in its chemical composition,dispersion,the quantity of amorphous phase and so on,which leads to the change of properties of the blended cement consisted of CEM I and supplemented with different amount of slag.Slag Cement AustraliaSlag.Groundgranulated blastfurnace slag (GGBFS) is produced by quenching molten iron slag (a byproduct of iron and steelmaking) from a blast furnace in water,to produce a granular product that is then dried and ground into a fine powder.GGBFS is typically used in concrete requiring a lower heat of hydration,and
