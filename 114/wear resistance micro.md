## An index to evaluate the wear resistance of the electrode in micro
Jun 10,2004 In this study,the effects of thermal properties on electrode wear were investigated.It was evident that the boiling point of the electrode material plays an important role in the wear mechanism of microEDM.Therefore,the boiling point cannot be negligible in considering the wear resistance of the electrodeMicrostructure and Wear Resistance of Al2O3 Coatings on.ML 10 friction and wear tester under dry sliding condition.It is found that the wear resistance of the micro powder coating is higher than that of nano.
