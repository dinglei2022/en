## Is thorium the perfect fuel? Feature Eduion in Chemistry
The liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR pronounced lifters) was first developed in the 1950s by Alvin Weinberg at Oak Ridge National Laboratory,US.This is a type of thorium molten salt reactor and is essentially a chemical plant.The development of LFTRs was soon mothballed because they did not produce very muchLiquid fluoride thorium reactor WikipediaThe liquid fluoride thorium reactor is a type of molten salt reactor.LFTRs use the thorium fuel cycle with a fluoridebased,molten,liquid salt for fuel.In a typical design,the liquid is pumped between a critical core and an external heat exchanger where the heat is transferred to a nonradioactive secondary salt.The secondary

## Thorium fuel cycle Wikipedia
20191023&ensp&#0183&enspThe thorium fuel cycle is a nuclear fuel cycle that uses an isotope of thorium,232 Th,as the fertile material.In the reactor,232 Th is transmuted into the fissile artificial uranium isotope 233 U which is the nuclear fuel.Unlike natural uranium,natural thorium contains only trace amounts of fissile material (such as 231 Th ),which areIs Thorium the Fuel of the Future to Revitalize Nuclear2019813&ensp&#0183&enspThis trend could continue until market forces make nuclear technology obsolete.Into this dynamic comes a resurgence in nuclear technology: liquid fluoride thorium reactors,or LFTRs ("lifters").
