A properly designed mixture possesses the desired workability for the fresh concrete and the required durability and strength for the hardened concrete.Typically,a mix is about 10 to 15 percent cement,60 to 75 percent aggregate and 15 to 20 percent water.Entrained air in many concrete mixes may also take up another 5 to 8 percent.
