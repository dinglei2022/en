## WO2004090178A1 Recovery of platinum group metals
ABSTRACT A process of recovering platinum group metals (PGMs) from a pregnant solution or leachate containing PGM values and base metals,typically a cyanide solution or leachate.A nonselective precipitation of the PGM values and base metals to form an insoluble precipitate comprising the PGM values and base metals is followed by selective leaching of the precipitate.Cyanide Leaching Chemistry of PlatinumGroup Metals CDC stacksrecovery of the platinumgroup metals (PGM) contained therein (13).4 (All references to alysts in this report should be taken as automobile exhaust alysts unless otherwise noted.) The process involves leaching at ele vated temperatures and pressures with cyanide.The proc ess has been successfully demonstrated

## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching An Introduction
Oct 20,2014&nbsp&#0183&#32At the end of the leach the loaded carbon is removed from the slurry and the adsorbed gold is stripped out at high temperature and pressure with sodium hydroxide and cyanide solutions to form a high value electrolyte solution.Gold bullion is then recovered from the electrolyte by electrowinning.That much is straight forward.Hightemperature cyanide leaching of platinumgroup metalsThe U.S.Bureau of Mines Reno Research Center operated a batch pilot plant to demonstrate hightemperature cyanide leaching or recovering platinum group metals (PGM) from automobile alysts.Approximately 1,600 kg of used pellet,monolith,and metal support alyst containing 1,700 g

## Alternative lixiviants to cyanide for leaching gold ores
The fundamental difference between the Platsols process and the conventional hightemperature pressureoxidation processes is that a small concentration of chloride ions is added to the autoclave with 25 g L sulfuric acid.The chloride favours the oxidation of gold and platinumgroup metals and stabilizes them as dissolved chlorocomplexes.Leaching platinumgroup metals in a sulfuric acid chloride solutionA leaching process was established based on the ability of platinumgroup metals to form stable chlorocomplexes in acidic chloride solutions.Leaching platinumgroup metals in a sulfuric acid chloride solution Extraction of each metal increased with temperatures up to 125°C but plateaued at higher temperatures.

## Metals Special Issue : Advances in Hydrometallurgy
Mineable platinum group metal (PGM) deposits are rare and found in relatively few areas of the world.At the same time,the use of PGM is predicted to expand in green technology and energy appliions,and PGMs are consequently currently listed as European Union critical metals.PLATSOL™ Process Provides a Viable Alternative to SmeltingPlatsolTM is a new single step,pressure leaching process developed at SGS by International PGM Technologies to recover platinum group metals (PGMs),gold and base metals such as Cu,Ni and Co from a variety of high and low grade ores,concentrates,PlatsolTM is a high temperature (&gt200OC) pressure leaching

## Studies on platinum recovery from solutions after leaching of spent
The following processes have been discussed: acid leaching of spent alysts and solvent extraction of platinum(IV) ions by using eventually chosen alysts were based on the highly active platinum group metals.(Tweeg 1999).The PGM.during high temperature cyanide leaching from alysts.The level of platinum.Magnetic Adsorbents for the Recovery of Precious Metals MDPINov 27,2017 Abstract: Precious metals which include the platinum group,gold,and silver,play indispensable PM sources,dissolution of target metals using suitable solvents or otherwise known as leaching.synthesis is carried out under high temperature and pressure in an autoclave with water as the reaction.
