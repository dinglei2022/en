## Assessment of natural radioactivity in fertilizers and phosphate ores
Radionuclide concentrations of uranium (238U),thorium (232Th) and potassium (40K) maintained in 10 phosphate ore and 5 fertilizer samples were measured using a highpurity germanium detector.The concentrations of these radionuclides in the phosphate ore samples were relatively high for 226Ra at 871.37 ± 91.90Comparative Geochemical Assessment of Nigerian Phosphates IJESITogo,Morocco,Jordan,USA,Algeria,China,etc.With the current economic reforms and investment incentives in Nigeria,interested investors are highly welcome to take advantage of developing these deposits.KEYWORDS: Nigerian phosphate rock,fertilizer,food security.I.INTRODUCTION.The main aim of this paper is
