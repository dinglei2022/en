Types of Magnetic Materials To study magnetic properties of Magnetic Materials,the material is usually placed in a uniform magnetic field and then the magnetic field is varied There are three major kinds of magnetic behaviour: Diamagnetic materials; These materials are barely magnetized when placed in a magnetic fieldMagnetic Materials EutectixMagnetic materials manufactured by Eutectix comprise both Alnico (AlNiCo) magnetic materials and rare earth magnetic materials such as neodymium iron boron (NdFeB.

It should be no surprise that most applications of magnetic materials call for ferromagnetic materials.These are the ones that interact most strongly with magnetic.MAGNETIC MATERIALS (HARD AND SOFT) In Depth TutorialsThese are materials exhibiting ferromagnetism.The magnetic properties of all materials make them respond in some way to a magnetic field,but most materials are diamagnetic or paramagnetic and show almost no response.The materials that are most important to []

Diamagnetic,Paramagnetic,and Ferromagnetic Materials.When a material is placed within a magnetic field,the magnetic forces of the material&#39s electrons will be affected.This effect is known as Faraday&#39s Law of Magnetic Induction.However,materials can react quite differently to the presence of an external magnetic field.
