## Encapsulation of zincrifampicin complex into transferrinconjugated
Apr 26,2016 It was shown that some metaldrug complexes are more potent as compared to pure drug.Toward this end,the interactions of some antibiotics with transition metals have been studied.Among them,zinc is known to exhibit antibacterial activity.Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles are even more efficient alongEffect of Zinc Maleate Zinc Oxide Complex on Thermal Stability ofDec 20,2017 In this study,zinc maleate (ZnMA) and zinc oxide (ZnO) complex (ZnMA ZnO) was prepared by two methods,namely,by the reaction of maleic acid (MAH) with excess ZnO in aqueous solution and by direct mixing of ZnMA and ZnO at 180°C.The chemical structure of the complex was analyzed by Xray
