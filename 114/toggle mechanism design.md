Abstract: Optimal synthesis of mechanisms is a successful approach for mechanism design to satisfy all the desired characteristics of the designed mechanism.Toggles have wide industrial appliions such as riveting,punching,pressing,and clamping.The toggle optimal design problem is a constrained multidimensionalDesign of mechanical presses driven by multiservomotor†This paper proposes a socalled multiservomotor parallel driven scheme to construct high capacity mechanical presses.The design method is based on the combination of dual screw actuation unit,parallel mechanism with kinematic redundancy (PMKR) and toggle mechanism with symmetric arrangement.Here,the dual
