## The hightemperature heat capacity of natural calcite
The heat capacity (C P) of a natural sample of calcite (CaCO 3) has been measured from 350 to 775 K by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).Heat capacities determined for a powdered sample and a singlecrystal disc are in close agreement and have a total uncertainty of &#1771 percent.Calcium Element information,properties and usesThe compounds of calcium are however much more useful than the element itself.Literature dating back to 975 AD shows that plaster of Paris (which is calcium sulphate) was used even then for setting broken bones.Calcium oxide (also known as lime or quicklime) is a major component of mortar and cement.
