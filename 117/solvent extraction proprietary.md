## (PDF) Chapter 6.Solvent Extraction ResearchGate
Solvent extraction is a common technique utilized for both industrial appliions and in the laboratory.The technique is successfully applied as a sample preparation procedure for chromatography.Extraction MethodsWe mainly operate using solvent extraction methods such as both butane (BHO),propane (PHO),ethanol,and even a proprietary chemical solvent developed by Halo to distill isolates.We also have the capability to conduct supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) extraction,one of the most popular methods for edibles and vape cartridges.
