## (PDF) Examples of modern silo design ResearchGate
In the present paper three examples will be presented in order to illustrate the range of application of silo design methods: the design of a silo for storage of moist limestone,the dimensioning.Silos design Flow of powder2019610&ensp&#0183&enspSilos design Flow of powder (for Loss In Weight Feeder for example).The mechanical design of the agitator must be studied in detail in order to sustain the forces required to move the powder.Such design is also not preferrable for hygienic appliions (risks or Foreign Body,hopper cleaning) Silo Design good principles.
