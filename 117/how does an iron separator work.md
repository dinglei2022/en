## 8: Magnetic Ore separator 10 Inventions by Thomas Edison,
Probably the biggest financial failure of Edison's career was the magnetic ore separator The idea,which Edison's laboratory experimented with during the 1880s and 1890s,was to use magnets to separate iron ore from unusable lower grade or This would mean that abandoned mines could be profitable.Magnetic separation WikipediaMagnetic Separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using magnets to attract magnetic materials The process that is used for magnetic separation detaches non magnetic material with those who are magnetic This technique is useful for not all,but few minerals such as ferromagnetic (materials strongly affected by magnetic fields) and paramagnetic (materials that are less.
