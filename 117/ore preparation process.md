## Zinc: smelting,producing and classifiionMetalpedia
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.The most common zinc concentrate processed is zinc sulfide,which is obtained by concentrating sphalerite using the froth flotation method.There are two methods of smelting zinc: the pyrometallurgical process and the hydrometallurgical process (over 90% of hydrometallurgical process is inIron Extraction Process DillingerIron Extraction Process.In the blast furnace process,the first step on the way towards heavy plate,pig iron is produced from iron ore.The composition of the ore and additions is accurately adjusted to the final products of AG der Dillinger H&#252ttenwerke and Saarstahl AG.
