## ARSENIC FACT SHEET
Figure 1: US Geological Survey Map of Arsenic in Groundwater (USGS,2005) In ground water,arsenic can combine with other elements to form inorganic as well as organic,and phosphate It has be demonstrated that each 05 mg L increase in phosphate above 02 mg L will reduce adsorption capacity by roughly 30% (US EPA,2014) Therefore,a.Study of Physico Chemical Characteristics of Wastewater in,Phosphorous content was determined using Phosphate Vials (Phosphate Cell Test 05 250 mg L PO 4 P or 15 767 mg L P O 4 − 3,Merck,Germany) with a method that was analogous to the US Standard Methods The method was based on the reaction of orthophosphate anions,in a sulphuric solution,with ammonium vanadate and ammonium.

## Report on the geology of the Philippine Islands
An attempt will be made in the following paper to bring together,so far as is practicable,all that is known of the geology of the Philippine Islands.The report is intended as a vade mecum for geologists in the field and a guide to the literature in the office.Doubtless something has escaped which should have been included,especially among the shrewd remarks of early Spanish travelers,butSearch results British Geological SurveyEditing and printing of geological maps and reports for Geological Survey Department,19962000 (2000).Environmental impact study on mineral waste from the Kabwe leadzinc mine,200406 (2006).Evaluation of some ceramic clays from Zambia.(1993).
