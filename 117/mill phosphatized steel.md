## Phosphate conversion coating
Phosphate coatings are used on steel parts for corrosion resistance,lubricity,or as a foundation for subsequent coatings or painting.It serves as a conversion coating in which a dilute solution of phosphoric acid and phosphate salts is applied via spraying or immersion and chemically reacts with the surface of the part being coated to form a layer of insoluble,crystalline phosphates.
