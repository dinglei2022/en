## Microwave Sintering,Brazing and Melting of Metallic
20151123&ensp&#0183&ensphand in case of microwave (and RFinduction) heating,the electromagnetic energy is absorbed by the material as a whole (also known as volumetric heating) due to microwavematter coupling and deep penetration,and then is converted in to heat through dielectric (in case of ceramics),magnetic permittivity eddy currents (metals) loss mechanisms.Sintering WikipediaSintering is the process of compacting and forming a solid mass of material by heat,The benefits of this method were proved for the sintering of refractory metals as well as conductive carbide or nitride powders,In microwave sintering,heat is sometimes generated internally within the material,rather than via surface.

## STUDY ON MICROWAVE PRETREATMENT OF REFRACTORY
By using the heating feature of microwave,it has shown from condition tests that the gold leaching recovery can be improved from 74% to more than 90% if the gold concentrates is treated for 5 minutes in a microwave oven at 450℃.Therefore,the gold leaching recovery of cyanide residue of more than 86% can be obtained in leaching plant.The results indie that microwave pretreatment tomicrowave pretreatment of a double refractory gold oreMicrowave pretreatment of a double refractory gold ore Double refractory gold ores,such as Barrick’s Goldstrike ore,contain both pyrite and carbonaceous matter and the latter results in the loss of gold from solution during cyanide leaching
