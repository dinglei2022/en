## Stibnite an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Antimony is most commonly found in sulfides and sulfo salts such as boulangerite,jamesonite,stibnite,and tetrehedrite,as well as in some oxides such as semarmontite,stibiconite,and valentinite.Of the more than 100 minerals of antimony that are found in nature,the predominant one is stibnite (Sb 2 S 3 ).Antimony Leaching from Stibnite and Complex Ores*2008130&ensp&#0183&enspANTIMONY LEACHING FROM STIBNITE AND COMPLEX ORES1 Y.T.John Kwong2,Allen Pratt2 and Gianluigi Botton2 Abstract.To shed light on the leaching of Sb from mine wastes containing stibnite,two series of experiments were conducted.In one experiment,polished slabs of a museumgrade stibnite and a mixedsulfide ore sample containing 28% Sb were

Antimony is a poor conductor of heat and electricity,it is stable in dry air and is not attacked by dilute acids or alkalis.Antimony and some of its alloys expand on cooling.Antimony has been known since ancient times.It is sometimes found free in nature,but is usually obtained from the ores stibnite (Sb 2 S 3) and valentinite (Sb 2 O 3Mechanism of stibnite volatilization at high temperature201535&ensp&#0183&enspshown for condensed phases in equilibrium with vapor phase at 900,1100 and 1300 &#176C as a function of the Fig.2 Relationship between Î”G and temperature of antimony
