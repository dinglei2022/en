## The Analysis of Alum manualzz
In Experiment 15A,you prepared alum crystals,KAl(SO4)2•12H2O In Experiment 15B,you will conduct a series of tests to determine if your crystals are really alum co py The first test is to find the melting temperature of the compound and compare this value with the accepted (published) value for alum (925&#176;C)Performance of alum and assorted coagulants in turbidityAs evidenced with Fig.3,turbidity removal is maximum at an optimized dose of alum 0.25 g l and when the dose is increased turbidity tends to reappear due to charge reversal.After having had run the samples with varying amounts of coagulants,it was observed that maximum turbidity was removed when alum was added at 0.5 g l at a ph of 7 with 10 NTU on turbidity meter (Figs.1,2).
