## What Are Rod Bearings? It Still Runs
In automotive mechanics a rod bearing is a plain bearing (as opposed to a ball bearing) used to hold spinning shafts in place where support is required to keep the rod straight over the course of its run.The phrase is also used as shorthand for connecting rod bearing12 Reasons Why Bearings FailThings break.No matter what you do,there is always a chance that products will fail.The same holds true for bearings,but that doesn’t mean that you can’t prevent many of the issues that result in costly downtime.This article is a guide to the major factors that can lead to bearing failure as well as how you can prevent the issues from happening.

## Failure of Tungsten Carbide Rolls from a Wire and Rod Mill.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The paper presents the failure analysis of tungsten carbide rolls for the Wire and Rod Mill (WRM) and establishes the failure reasons and the corrective and preventive actions taken to improve roll performance.A sharp continuous increase in failure rate and decrease in average time between failure (ATBF) was observed during 2001 to 2004.Bolt failure modes.: spacexFor bolt making,the steel grade used is called 'cold heading quality',as the bolt head is formed by cold forging.For the rod mill making the feed rod for the bolts,this means the maximum defect depth allowable in the finished rod is 0.06mm (according to Austral
