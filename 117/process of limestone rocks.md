Sedimentary Rocks Rivers,oceans,winds,and rain runoff all have the ability to carry the particles washed off of eroding rocks Such material,called detritus,consists of fragments of rocks and mineralsWhen the energy of the transporting current is not strong enough to carry these particles,the particles drop out in the process of sedimentationEverything You Need to Know About Sandstone ThoughtCo(A medium grained clastic carbonate rock,or "limestone sandstone," is called calcarenite.) This division makes sense because limestone is made in clean ocean water.
