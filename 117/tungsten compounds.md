## Tungsten W PubChem
Tungsten is a naturally occurring element.It occurs in rocks and minerals combined with other chemicals,but never as a pure metal.Elemental tungsten is a white to steel gray metal (depending on the purity) that can be used in pure form or mixed with other metals to make alloys.Tungsten alloys tend to be strong and flexible,resist wear,and conduct electricity well.Tungsten springerTungsten is a peerreviewed,international and interdisciplinary research journal that focuses on all aspects of tungsten and related metals,including molybdenum,cobalt,vanadium,tantalum,niobium,rhenium,as well as their alloys and compounds.Submissions are invited in all topical areas,ranging from basic aspects of the science of tungsten and related metals,their derived alloys and
