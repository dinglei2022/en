## Novel Concrete can Withstand Road Salt Deterioration
Copious amounts of road salt are used each winter to protect roads from ice and preserve safe driving conditions.However,this is gradually degrading the concrete they are made of.Engineers are quite aware of the fact that calcium chloride salt,universally used as deicer,reacts with the calcium hydroxide found in concrete to form a chemical byproduct that causes roadways to crumble.Calcium carbonate The Essential Chemical IndustryLimestone and chalk are both forms of calcium carbonate and dolomite is a.60% metallurgy (mainly steel manufacture,slag formation and its use in the blast.The role of the calcium sulfate is to prevent the cement from setting too quickly.
