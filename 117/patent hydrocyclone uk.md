## Hydrocyclone Wikipedia
2019620&ensp&#0183&enspA hydrocyclone (often referred to by the shortened form cyclone) is a device to classify,separate or sort particles in a liquid suspension based on the ratio of their centripetal force to fluid resistance.This ratio is high for dense (where separation by density is required) and coarse (where separation by size is required) particles,andFlow Field and Fibre Fractionation Studies in Hydrocyclones20061122&ensp&#0183&enspconical hydrocyclone with cylindrical top part (Svarovsky,1984).The first patent to be granted on a hydrocyclone was the "Water Purifier" by Bretney (1891) (see Figure 1 left).The basic idea was to use the strong gravitational field created by the rotating fluid for removing unwanted
