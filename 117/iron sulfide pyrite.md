## Pyrite formation from FeS and H2S is mediated through
Pyrite is the most abundant ironâˆ’sulfur mineral in sediments.Over geological times,its burial controlled oxygen levels in the atmosphere and sulfate concentrations in seawater.However,the mechanism of pyrite formation in sediments is still being debated.We show that lithotrophic microorganisms can mediate the transformation of FeS and H2S to FeS2 at ambient temperature if metabolicallyIron Pyrite: Meaning,Properties and Powers The Complete20191212&ensp&#0183&enspIron Pyrite Properties.Iron pyrite is one of the most common sulfide minerals in the world that's more popularly known as Fool's Gold.It got its name because it looks just like gold to people who don't know what real gold looks like! Although iron pyrite has the same brass yellow and metallic luster,it's lighter in color than gold.
