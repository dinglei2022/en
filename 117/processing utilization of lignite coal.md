## Development Status of Lignite Quality Improvement
China has rich lignite resource,which has high moisture,low calorific value,short ignition period,etc.These characters limit lignite largescale processing,utilization and transport also become difficult.Therefore,under our country's coaldominated energy structure,lignite quality improvement technology can enhance the development and appliion for optimizing the energy structure.Clean Coal Technology R&ampD program2018315&ensp&#0183&enspPolish coal energy facts 1.Polish production of coal for energy: 11 mln Mg,coking coal: 2 mln Mg (2012).2.In 2011 hard coal and lignite based electricity production amounted to 89% of the total electricity production.According to „Polish Energy Policy to 2030" share of coal based net electricity should reach 88% in 2010 and 82% in 2015.3.
