## Autoclaved aerated concrete,AAC,Aircrete
Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC,Aircrete) Autoclaved aerated concrete is a versatile lightweight construction material and usually used as blocks.Compared with normal (ie: "dense" concrete) aircrete has a low density and excellent insulation properties.The low density is achieved by the formation of air voids to produce a cellularDetailed Procedure for Concrete Mix DesignConcrete Mix design helps to proportionate concrete's ingredients (cement,sand,aggregate &amp; water) and help concrete achieve the desired strength,workability etc.Here is a detailed procedure for Concrete Mix design as per IS 10262:2009

## How to make concrete bricks and blocks
Keep aggregates and cement dry and separate until you need to mix them.Bags of cement should ideally be stored in a dry room.You’ll need space to produce and store the concrete bricks and blocks.A flat concrete slab is ideal about 50 square metres isConcrete Mix Design Different Grades of Concrete&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Concrete Mix Design: Concrete is a composite mixture which consists of Cement,Sand and Aggregate.Concrete mix design is the procedure for finding the right quantities of these materials to achieve the desired strength.Accurate concrete mix design makes concrete construction economical.

## Making Concrete Blocks
The standard mix for Concrete Blocks is 1:3:5,1 part cement to 3 parts sand &amp; 5 parts stone aggregate,by volume.1 part cement to 8 parts mixed aggregate is much the same thing.Note that the ratio is different by weight,since the ingredients don't have the same density.Designing Concrete Mixtures Civil Engineering201852&ensp&#0183&enspDesigning Concrete Mixtures There are three phases in the development of a concrete mixture: specifying,designing,and proportioning ACI Mix Design The most common method used in North America is that established by ACI Recommended Practice 211.1 Any mix design procedure will provide a first approximation
