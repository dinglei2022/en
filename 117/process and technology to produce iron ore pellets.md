## Iron ore pellet properties under simulated blast furnace Jultika
Jun 9,2017 University of Oulu Graduate School University of Oulu,Faculty of Technology A blast furnace is the dominant process for making iron in the world.Iron ore pellets are commonly used as iron burden materials in a blast furnace.Iron ore is generally charged in the form of pellets,sinter or lump ore.Iron ore pelletizing MetsoIron ore fines are agglomerated into pellets and then indurated using a furnace to create iron ore pellets.These are typically fed to a blast furnace or DRI plant as part of the process to make steel.
