## Microbiological leaching of a lowgrade uranium ore by
Summary.The microbiological leaching of lowgrade uranium ore has been investigated using a pure strain ofThiobacillus ferrooxidans.It has been shown that only minute quantities of iron are required to achieve a maximum effect on uranium release.Mining on Dartmoor Kenyon College2008126&ensp&#0183&enspThereafter,only smaller amounts of tin were dug in Dartmoor except for one year,1706,in which 123,636 pounds were brought up,(Worth 288).There was a slight increase during the Napoleonic Wars period,coupled with the approaching industrial aged,due to innovations of plating iron with tin,but tinning on Dartmoor continued to dwindle.
