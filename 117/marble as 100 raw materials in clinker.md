## Utilization of Waste Marble Powder in Cement Industry A
2012324&ensp&#0183&enspIn particular,cement fabriion involves a huge consumption of natural raw materials (e.g.limestone and clay).Of our particular interest is the use of waste marble powder in cement industry as a substitute of limestone for the production of clinker.Preparation of calcium sulfoaluminate belite cement from,Jun 15,2016&#0183;&#32;The recycling of waste material was successfully carried out leading to the production of less CO 2 emission cement known as sulfoaluminate belite cement The influences of the cement raw mix composition and the different burning temperature were investigated to evaluate the reuse feasibility of marble sludge waste material in cement production
