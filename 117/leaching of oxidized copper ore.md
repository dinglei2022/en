## Copper Heap Leaching & SX EW Slideshow
Heap leaching & SX EW is a method of extracting pure copper from oxide ore by placing the crushed ore on a pad in a heap and spraying the leaching solution,sulphuric acid,over the heap The acid trickles through the heap and dissolves the copper mineral into solution The leach solution collects at the bottom of the pad in a collection pondCopper Leaching Method Metallurgist &amp Mineral20191023&ensp&#0183&enspExtraction of copper from suitable ore by leaching methods is generally assumed to cost less than the combined expense of concentration,smelting,and refining,and experimental data tend to confirm this opinion.At the ButteDuluth plant,which is handling in excess of 100 tons of oxidized ore daily,the copper is said to cost $0.085 per pound.
