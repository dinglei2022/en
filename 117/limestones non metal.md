## What are some examples of nonmetallic minerals and their
Nonmetallic minerals are ordinarily divided into four groups on the basis of the field in which they are used: (1) chemical raw materials (apatite,halite,sylvinite,carnallite,bischofite,polyhalite,native sulfur,sulfur pyrite,celestite,bariron ore limestones ntoeffektlimestones non metal.iron ore limestones.A blast furnace is a type of metallurgical furnace used for smelting to produce industrial metals,generally pig iron,but also others such as lead or copper.Blast refers to the combustion air being &quotforced&quot or supplied above atmospheric pressure.

## Limestone Sedimentary rocks
Limestone is a very common sedimentary rock consisting of calcium carbonate (more than 50%).It is the most common nonsiliciclastic (sandstone and shale are common siliciclastic rocks) sedimentary rock.Limestones are rocks that are composed of mostly calcium carbonate (minerals calcite or aragonite).Using Limestone for Gardens &amp Soil How Much to Use onUse only plastic or glass containers.Metal can change the results.Tell the person conducting the soil test what you intend to plant in the area from where you've drawn the soil sample.They may recommend different amounts of lime to adjust the soil pH based on what you intend to grow.
