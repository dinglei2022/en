## How Does a Coal Power Plant Work? Bright Hub Engineering
Thermalbased power plants can produce electricity from coal or other fuel sources.The coalfired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption.Coal fired power plants,while producing power,require a lot of water and produce a lot of pollutants like ash and CO2.Clean Coal Technologies Carbon Capture and Storage CCSSummit Power Group's Texas Clean Energy Project (TCEP) at Penwell is a 377 MWe IGCC power plant burning coal with CCS,capturing 90% of CO 2 and 90% of NO x.It has $450 million funding from the DOE Clean Coal Power Initiative towards its $2.4 billion cost.It was due to operate from 2015,but construction start is not yet in sight.
