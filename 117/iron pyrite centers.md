## Pyrite
The mineral pyrite,or iron pyrite,is iron sulfide,FeS 2.It has isometric crystals that usually appear as cubes.The cube faces may be striated (parallel lines on crystal surface or cleavage face) as a result of alternation of the cube and pyritohedron faces.Pyrite McGill School Of Computer Science2009417&ensp&#0183&enspThis formalism recognizes that the sulfur atoms in pyrite occur in pairs with clear SS bonds.These persulfide units can be viewed as derived from hydrogen persulfide,H 2 S 2.Thus pyrite would be more descriptively called iron persulfide,not iron disulfide.In contrast,molybdenite,MoS 2,features isolated sulfide (S 2) centers.
