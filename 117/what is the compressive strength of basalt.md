## Properties of Basalt Physical Thermal
The hardness of Basalt is 6 whereas its compressive strength is 37.40 N mm 2.Streak is the color of rock when it is crushed or powdered.Streak is the color of rock when it is crushed or powdered.The streak of Basalt is white to grey whereas its fracture is conchoidal.Numerical Study for Compressive Strength of Basalt.I n this study,we investigated the buckling performance of basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP) sandwich infill panels.Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) is a major evolution for energy dissipation when used as infill material of frame structure,a basic Polymer Matrix Composite (PMC) infill wall system consists of two FRP laminates surrounding an infill of foam core.
