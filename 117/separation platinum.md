## The Properties and Appliions of Platinum
Platinum is a dense,stable and rare metal that is often used in jewelry for its attractive,silverlike appearance,as well as in medical,electronic,and chemical appliions due to its various and unique chemical and physical properties.Separating Platinum from Gold During the Early Eighteenth20191130&ensp&#0183&enspAs has been said already,not all of the platinum group metals are soluble in nitric acid,indeed platina is not completely dissolved by this method either.Tillet gave positive errors in the range of 0.3 to 1 per cent in the separation of platinum from the silvergoldplatinum alloy in which the platinum varied from 2.2 to 2.9 per cent.

## What Are Platinum Group Metals (PGMs)? The Balance
The platinum group metals (PGMs) are six transitional metal elements that are chemically,physically,and anatomically similar.The PGMs are the densest known metal elements.Exceptionally rare,the six metals naturally occur in the same ore bodies.They are highly durable and,due to their high value,often recycled,giving them long life cycles.Removal of platinum from water by precipitation or liquid2013324&ensp&#0183&enspFinally,two methods for quantitative separation of gold and platinum in water using in each method two extraction steps have been proposed.The back extraction of platinum(IV) during the second separation process was also discussed.
