In the immediate vicinity of these deposits is a great mass of serpentine in which there are extensive outcrops of iron stone pointing to the existence of large deposits of haematite or magnetic iron ore beneath.NEW ZEALAND There are several deposits of chromite in New Zealand,none of which appears to be worked at the present time.Origin of the UG2 chromitite layer,Bushveld ComplexMathez &amp Mey argued that the pegmatoidal rocks,which are diagnostic of the UG2,formed when hydrous interstitial melt percolated up through the partially molten crystal pile,ponded beneath a relatively impermeable UG2 chromitite,and metasomatized and partially melted the surrounding rocks,which upon cooling recrystallized to the pegmatoids.
