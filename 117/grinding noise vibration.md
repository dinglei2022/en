## grinding noise and vibration 2002 Mini Cooper
A grinding noise can be heard as soon as the car moves forward.Also a vibration is felt but only when accelerating in 4th and 5th gear (there is no vibration in 1st,2nd or 3rd gears and accelerating does not appear to be an issue).Vibration stops after reaching a steady speed in 4th or 5th or foot is off gas pedal.
