## How are the columns of the periodic table named as IA,IIA
In modern periodic table,there are 18 groups and 7 periods.The groups in the periodic table are numbered from 1 to 18 successively.However,the groups are also identified as IA,IB IIA,IIb and so on.This numbering of each group is based onperiodic table Indiana University Northwest200925&ensp&#0183&ensp(a) g cm3 (b) kJ mol (c) Atomic weight in ( ) = mass number of most stable isotope (d) Half life of most abundant radioactive isotope

Thus the modern periodic law can be stated as: &quotThe chemical and physical properties of elements are the periodic functions of their atomic numbers and electronic configurations.&quot The modern long form of periodic table was constructed based on above law.The following points are considered while constructing the periodic table.Why is Group 1 on the periodic table called the alkaliThe alkali metals,found in group 1 of the periodic table (formerly known as group IA),are very reactive metals that do not occur freely in nature.These metals have only one electron in their outer shell.Therefore,they are ready to lose that one electron in ionic bonding with other elements.
