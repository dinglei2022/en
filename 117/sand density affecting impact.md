The sand can be packed by hand,but machines that use pressure or impact ensure even packing of the sand and require far less time,thus increasing the production rate.After the sand has been packed and the pattern is removed,a cavity will remain that forms the external shape of the casting.Factors Affecting the Impact of OffRoad SpringerLinkFactors Affecting the Impact of OffRoad Driving on Soils in an Area in the Kruger National Park,South Africa Traffic pressure was applied with a game drive vehicle loaded with 11 sand bags,each weighing 70 kg.The researchers came to the conclusion that bulk density was not the best factor to use in root penetration studies.

The soil compaction can be defined as "the process by which the soil grains are rearranged to decrease void space and bring them into closer contact with one another,thereby,increasing the bulk density" (SSSA 1996).So,the soil compaction involves the changes in physical properties of the soil (bulk density and soil porosity) and these modified physical parameters of the soil areSoil Physical Properties Affecting Soil Erosion in2004712&ensp&#0183&enspSoil Physical Properties Affecting Soil Erosion 235 potential,one of the forces drawing water into the soil,which occurs as the infiltration process proceeds.In unstable soils,a second cause for the decrease in the infiltration rate with time is the deterioration of soil structure on the surface occurring during the infiltration process.
