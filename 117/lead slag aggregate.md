## Slag
Slag is the glass like by product left over after a desired metal has been separated (i.e.smelted) from its raw ore.Slag is usually a mixture of metal oxides and silicon dioxide.However,slags can contain metal sulfides and elemental metals.While slags are generally used to remove waste in metal smelting,they can also serve other.ConcreteConcrete is strong in compression,as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load.However,it is weak in tension as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack,allowing the structure to fail.Reinforced concrete adds either steel reinforcing bars,steel fibers,aramid fibers,carbon fibers,glass fibers,or plastic fibers to carry tensile loads.
