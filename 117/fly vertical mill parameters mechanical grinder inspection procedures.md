## Milling (machining)
Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece.This may be done varying direction on one or several axes,cutter head speed,and pressure.Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines,on scales from small individual parts to large,heavy duty gang milling operations.tool post grinder on a vertical mill&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;On a vertical mill,mount the grinder to the quill to bore,dividing head verticla,and table x or y for offset.You may want to lock the spindle so it can't rotate.Use the sensitive down feed cranking in one hand while cranking the dividing head furiously with the other (or get a coordinated helper.
