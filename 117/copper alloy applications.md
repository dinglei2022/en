publiion to 90 10 and 70 30 coppernickel alloys refer to the alloys normally containing iron and manganese as used in marine appliions.When the 70 30 alloy is mentioned it should be borne in mind that in some circumstances it is preferable to use the alloy with 2% iron,2% manganese (BS designation CN 108) rather thanMarine Appliions : KME Engineering Copper SolutionsMARINE APPLICATIONS Seawater Resistant Piping Systems and CopperNickel (OSNA &#17410) Cladding for Corrosion Protection on Offshore Structures.For decades,KME has been the expert in the development and manufacture of coppernickel alloy products for seawater appliions supplying a unique range of piping components from one single source.
