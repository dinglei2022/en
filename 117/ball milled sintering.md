## Enhancement of Thermoelectric Performance of Ball‐Milled
Interface modifiion in transport properties of single elemental polycrystalline Bi via spark plasma sintering results in 'double‐decoupling' (simultaneous decoupling of thermopower,electrical,and thermal conductivity) of otherwise coupled entities.In spark plasma sintering,the DC pulse current helps in controlling the nature and extent of surfaces of ball‐milled Bi and henceEffect of sintering in ballmilled K 2 Bi 8 Se 13K 2 Bi 8 Se 13 has many attractive features for thermoelectric appliions.Recently,K 2 Bi 8 Se 13 based nanocomposite materials,consisting of nanocrystalline,microcrystalline and amorphous phases,have been fabried based on powder technology techniques.The Seebeck coefficient has been enhanced while the thermal conductivity has been decreased presenting,thus,interesting behavior.
