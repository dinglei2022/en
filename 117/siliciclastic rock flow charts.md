## Sequence Stratigraphic Framework SEPM Strata
Lyell's premise in 1830,1832 &amp 1833 that "the present is the key to the past" is fundamental to sequence stratigraphy's recognition that the sedimentary record of the earth's crust is the product of uniform and common physical processes that interacted with sediments as they accumulated.This means that the processes responsible for known portions of a geological section can beSEPM Special Publiion No 55 Siliciclastic DiagenesisAre you looking for an online professional &amp technical book store?

20001026&ensp&#0183&enspA good classifiion is based on some theory that explains how the rocks form,and are related to each other.We want to group together rocks that form by similar processes.The most general theoretical model we have for sedimentary rocks is the simple ideal model.The basic classifiion is based on that model.Reservoirs Our Services Petroleum SRK Consulting20191127&ensp&#0183&enspReservoirs.In the petroleum system,one of the key requirements is the presence of a high quality reservoir rock,this rock can either be siliciclastic (i.e.sandstone) or carbonate (i.e.limestone or dolomite).Permeability this is defined as the ability of a rock to allow the flow of fluids or gases through it,typically measured in

## Sedimentary rock Grain size Britannica
Sedimentary rock Sedimentary rock Grain size: Particle size is an important textural parameter of clastic rocks because it supplies information on the conditions of transportation,sorting,and deposition of the sediment and provides some clues to the history of events that occurred at the depositional site prior to final induration.Clastic rock Wikipedia2019101&ensp&#0183&enspClastic rocks are composed of fragments,or clasts,of preexisting minerals and rock.A clast is a fragment of geological detritus,[1] chunks and smaller grains of rock broken off other rocks by physical weathering.[2] Geologists use the term clastic with reference to sedimentary rocks as well as to particles in sediment transport whether in
