## Characteristics of the magnetic control of separable
There were shown the necessity of upgrading the present approach in order to realize the method of magnetic control.For example,it is necessary to take into account not only the rest of ferrous impurities (that is inevitable after limited numbers of operations) but also a factor of involving sand particles.US3672579A Process for beneficiating magnetite iron oreA process for upgrading lowgrade magnetitecontaining iron ore with minimum fine grinding.The dry ore is first comminuted to between about threefourths inch and 10 mesh particle size and magnetically separated.The dry tailing is discarded and the concentrate is ground to between about 20 and 100 mesh and again subjected to dry magnetic separation.
