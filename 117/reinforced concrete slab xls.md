## Concrete Beam 1way Slab Spreadsheet (v1.1) WikiEngineer
This spreadsheet will find the flexural capacity of a rectangular concrete beam or 1way slab.It is solved using LRFD loads.If the area of steel (A s) is known then it can be entered into the Inputs section,otherwise minimum steel (A smin) will be used.The diagram in Figure 1.shows the compression block and tension steel of a concrete beam in a balanced condition.
