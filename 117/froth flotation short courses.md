## How to introduce myself to the flotation separation,
Answer: Flotation is a mineral separation process done in the water medium It is based on the difference in the surface properties of the mineral and gangue The surface of the selected mineral is made hydrophobic (water repellent) by the use of selective reagents and these particles get attache.MPTech Centre for Minerals Research20191130&ensp&#0183&enspFlotation surveys conducted by MPTech have provided plants with information that has allowed them to calibrate and stabilise air input and froth depth down a flotation bank,to optimise reagent addition (dosage and point of addition) and to reconfigure stream routings leading to improved metallurgical performance.Short Courses Courses of

## AMIT 145: Lesson 5 Froth Flotation Mining Mill Operator,
Froth flotation is a physico chemical separation process Separation is principally based on differences in surface hydrophobicity However,particle size and density have a significant impact Initial flotation patent and application was developed for graphite by the Bessel brothers (1877) Similar to graphite,coal is naturally hydrophobicFlotation Froth an overview ScienceDirect TopicsFroth flotation is a process that selectively separates materials based upon whether they are water repelling (hydrophobic) or have an affinity for water (hydrophilic) Importantly,the word flotation is also used in the literature to describe the process in density separation in which lighter microplastics float to the surface of a salt solution
