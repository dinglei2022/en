This percentage is known as a crushing value of aggregate.This percentage should not exceed 30% of the total weight of aggregate taken for the test.The aggregate crushing value test result should not be more than 30 % for the concrete used for roads and pavements and,in case of other structures it may be permitted up to 45%.Aggregates for Concrete University of Memphis2018821&ensp&#0183&enspaggregate content is usually 35% to 45% by mass or volume of the total aggregate content.CHARACTERISTICS OF AGGREGATES.The important characteristics of aggregates for concrete are listed in Table 52 and most are discussed in the following section: Grading.Grading is the particlesize distribution of an aggregate as

Because maximum aggregate size can impact concrete properties such as shrinkage,and also the cost of concrete,the largest aggregate size consistent with the requirements of 26.4.2.1 should be permitted.With the w cm fixed,the larger the nominal maximum size of aggregates,the lower the cement content for a given consistency.Or,statedImpact Of Size Of Course Aggregate On Compressive2017113&ensp&#0183&enspaggregate size and effective strength of concrete.Abstract: This paper is about the aggregate size of the concrete and its direct impact on its compressive strength.This study was conducted in Iqra National University Peshawar.In this research the size of aggregate was randomly selected as (1.5 inch,1 inch,0.8 inch,0.4 inch and 0.2 inch).
