## Two Bit Placer Montana Gold And Silver Mines
Although the boom was over,lesser amounts of placer gold would continue to be taken from the gulch for the next two decades.Chinese miners leased many of the original claims and methodically worked over the mined areas,recovering considerable amounts of gold missed by the early placer miners.Placer mining Britannica20191213&ensp&#0183&enspPlacer mining,ancient method of using water to excavate,transport,concentrate,and recover heavy minerals from alluvial or placer deposits.Examples of deposits mined by means of this technique are the goldbearing sands and gravel that settle out from rapidly moving streams and rivers at points where the current slows down.

Between 1978 and 2009,approximately 430,000 oz of placer gold were obtained from the Indian River and Black Hills Creek,which equates to roughly 20% of the production for the entire Yukon Territory during that period.The area is unglaciated,exposure is poor,and there are few known lode gold occurrences present.Types of Placers Mineral Processing &amp Metallurgy20191125&ensp&#0183&enspA residual placer is,in effect,a concentration of gold (or other heavy mineral) at or near its point of release from the parent rock.In this type of placer the enrichment results from the elimination of valueless material rather than from concentration of values brought in from an outside source.

Alluvial Placer Gold Deposits.Definition: Alluvial deposits are the most common type of placer gold deposit.This egory includes fluxial (river and stream) placers which formed in welldefined channels.It also includes "bench" or terrace deposits.These are older river or streambeds which formed on the elevated side slopes of drainagePlacer Gold vs.Lode Gold (and how to find it!)Gold is gold,so there isn't necessarily a better type of gold.However,mining for lode gold has many more challenges that mining for placer gold.Placer gold mining is much easier.The gold is already separated from the rock,and gravity has concentrated the gold into creeks and rivers where it is more easily accessible.
