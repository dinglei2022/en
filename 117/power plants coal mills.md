## Coal Fired Power Plant Case Study: Coal Crusher Gearbox.
The Problem Coal fired power plants typically operate several ball mills or coal pulverizing mills to crush the incoming coal to the optimum size for combustion.This means that each power generation unit has five or six mills.The gearboxes that run these coal mills are usually lubricated with high viscosity oil,such as ISO VG320 or ISO VG460.
