## Separating Mixtures Lesson TeachEngineering
Students learn how to classify materials as mixtures,elements or compounds and identify the properties of each type.The concept of separation of mixtures is also introduced since nearly every element or compound is found naturally in an impure state such as a mixture of two or more substances,and it is common that chemical engineers use separation techniques to separate mixtures into theirChemistry for Kids: Separating Mixtures Ducksters201979&ensp&#0183&enspSomeone somewhere separated that substance from the mixture so we could use it.It turns out that many compounds and elements aren't found in nature in their pure form,but are found as parts of mixtures.Separating substances from mixtures is an important part of chemistry and modern industry.
