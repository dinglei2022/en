## Rydberg constant Wikipedia
2019625&ensp&#0183&enspIn spectroscopy,the Rydberg constant,symbol R∞ for heavy atoms or RH for hydrogen,named after the Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg,is a physical constant relating to the electromagnetic spectra of an atom.The constant first arose as an empirical fitting parameter in the Rydberg formula for the hydrogen spectral series,but Niels BohrRelative permittivity Wikipedia2019627&ensp&#0183&enspLikewise,relative permittivity is the ratio of the capacitance of a capacitor using that material as a dielectric,compared with a similar capacitor that has vacuum as its dielectric.Relative permittivity is also commonly known as dielectric constant,a term still used but depreed by standards organizations in engineering as well as in
