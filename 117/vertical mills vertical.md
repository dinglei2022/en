## Vertical Machining
Vertical Machining,also known as milling,relies on rotary cutters to remove metal from a workpiece.Vertical machining occurs on a vertical machining center (VMC),which employs a spindle with a vertical orientation.With a vertically oriented spindle,tools stick straight down from the tool holder,and often cut across the top of a workpiece.
