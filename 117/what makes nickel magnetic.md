## Why are all metals magnetic? Science Questions with …
When it comes to ferromagnetism,only very few elements are ferromagnetic,including iron,cobalt,and nickel.When people talk about magnetic materials,they usually mean ferromagnetic materials because that is the only type of magnetism easily observed inWhat Makes a Material Magnetic? SciencingNot just any material can be magnetic.In fact,of all the known elements,only a handful possess magnetic capability and they vary by degree.The strongest magnets are electromagnets,which gain their attractive force only when current passes through them.Current is the movement of electrons,and electrons are what

Is Nickel Magnetic? The element Nickel (Ni) is one of the few ferromagnetic metals.Ferromagnetic means they are attracted to magnets and can be magnetized themselves.Is Gold Magnetic?Is Gold Magnetic? Most people don t have a lot of gold lying around the house to test and see if it is magnetic.And anything less than 24 caret gold contains other metals to make it harder and less resistant to being scratched.By itself gold is not attracted to.
