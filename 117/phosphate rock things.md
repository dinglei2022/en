## Understanding phosphorus fertilizers UMN Extension
20191213&ensp&#0183&enspRock phosphate is the raw material used to manufacture most commercial phosphate fertilizers on the market.In the past,ground rock phosphate itself has been used as a source of P for acid soils.However,very little rock phosphate is currently used in agriculture due to low availability of P in this native material,high transportation costsThe phosphorus cycle — Science Learning HubThe phosphorus is obtained by mining deposits of rock phosphate.Locally produced sulfuric acid is used to convert the insoluble rock phosphate into a more soluble and usable form a fertiliser product called superphosphate.In New Zealand,superphosphate is made using rock imported mainly from Morocco.

## What is the difference between phosphate and phosphorus
A phosphate,an inorganic chemical,is a salt of phosphoric acid.Inorganic phosphates are mined to obtain phosphorus for use in agriculture and industry.In organic chemistry,a phosphate,or organophosphate,is an ester of phosphoric acid.* DonApatite: Its uses as a mineral and gemstone20191212&ensp&#0183&enspWhat is Apatite? Apatite is the name of a group of phosphate minerals with similar chemical compositions and physical properties.They are an important constituent of phosphorite,a rock mined for its phosphorus content and used to make fertilizers,acids,and chemicals.Apatite has a relatively consistent hardness and serves as the index mineral for a hardness of five in the Mohs Hardness Scale.
