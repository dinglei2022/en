A stone quarry typically produces the following products: Large size blocks blasted from the quarry face,from approximately 0.5 m 3 (approximately 0.36 tonne weight) to 1.25 m 3 (approximately 5 6 tonne weight),are called rip rap or rock armour and are used in coastal and river flood defence schemes to shore up sea fronts and river banks.Best practices: Drilling and blasting : Pit &amp; QuarryPit &amp; Quarry recently connected with Mirabelli to discuss this concept further,as well as best blasting practices.P&amp;Q: What are some of the most common blasting mistakes you see made at quarries? Mirabelli: I feel the biggest mistake is separating drilling from blasting.The traditional method of drilling and blasting is to treat the two.
