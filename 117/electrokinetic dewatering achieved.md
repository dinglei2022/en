## Progress in the Development of Prototypes for Phosphatic
2018530&ensp&#0183&enspPrevious research to develop batch electrokinetic dewatering processes resulted in the determination that the electrokinetic dewatering was not economically feasible.The objective of our work was to overcome the economic hurdle through the development of continuous electrokinetic dewateringDouble drain electrokinetic stabilization of dredged mudAs a result it is shown that significant amount of dewatering is achieved.The electrokinetic sedimentation of the dredged mud accelerated up to 20 times faster than selfweight sedimentation.The change of physiochemical properties of the dredged mud shows permanent changes in the soil structure.

## Electrokinetic desalination of porous building materials
Electrokinetic flow processes in porous media involve the movement of fluid (electroosmosis) and charged particles (electromigration) induced by an applied electrical field.In porous media one of the major appliion areas of electrokinetics is in soils,where it has been successfully used for dewatering,2019612&ensp&#0183&enspThe results achieved can further uncover the mechanism of electroosmosis as well as provide guidelines for engineering appliions of the electroosmosis
