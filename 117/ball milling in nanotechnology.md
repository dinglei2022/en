## Ball Milling
What is ball milling? A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind materials into extremely fine powder.7.Major parameters for ball milling TemperatureCan a ball mill machine be used to reduce a material size,Ball milling does reduce size from micro to nano,But it should be noted the efficiency of the machine depends on how much % of the material can it turn into nano A floor mill can make wheat or rice into nanopowder but not all particles are in nano range So to make all most of the particles into nano size many techniques exists
