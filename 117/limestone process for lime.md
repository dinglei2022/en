## Calcination Wikipedia
2019625&ensp&#0183&enspThe process of calcination derives its name from the Latin calcinare (to burn lime) due to its most common appliion,the decomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide,in order to create cement.The product of calcination is usually referred to in general as &quotcalcine" regardless of the actual minerals undergoing thermal treatment.Summary Report,Sulfur Oxides Control Technology Series,Solids Concentration and Disposal One of the main disadvantages of the lime limestone process,compared with regenerable processes,is the need for a waste pond,landfill,or other disposal area of sufficient size to receive the large quantity of waste solids produced Dewatering and possibly stabilization may be desirable to minimize this need.
