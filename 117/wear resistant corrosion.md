## Corrosionpedia What is Abrasion Resistance? Definition
Abrasion resistance resists mechanical wear.Abrasionresistant materials are useful for both moving and fixed parts in settings where wearing is an issue.Abrasion resistance has close proximity to the compressive strength of concrete.Strong concrete is more abrasionresistant than weak concrete.Corrosion Standards and Wear Standards ASTM InternationalASTM's corrosion standards are used to evaluate corrosion and corrosionprevention of metals.ASTM wear standards define tests for examining wear,friction,and erosion due to relative motion between a solid material and a contacting substance.
