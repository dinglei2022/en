## Pollution Control of CoalFired Power Generation in China
Q: Coalfired power generation plays a dominant role in the electricity mix in China,but it is also considered to be a significant source of air pollution.What is the current overall status of the emissions from coalfired power generation in China? A: For a long time,coalfired power generation has accounted for 75% of total power generation and the coal consumption for power generationPrevention of stack corrosion under wet SpringerLinkThis study investigated the prevention of stack corrosion under wet flue gas desulfurization conditions in a coalfired power plant.The performance analysis and comparative studies of six materials for the prevention of stack corrosion were investigated.
