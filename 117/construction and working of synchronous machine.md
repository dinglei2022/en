2019630&ensp&#0183&enspHi friends,in this article,I am going to discuss about synchronous motor working principle and construction.I hope you will find it interesting and helpful.Synchronous motor construction is very similar to that of a synchronous generator.As shown in the figure,essential parts of synchronous motor are same as those of the synchronous generator i.e.a stator and a rotor.Synchronous Motor : Working Principle,Types,and ApplicationsSalient pole rotors are used when a larger quantity of poles is required Construction of the synchronous motor and synchronous alternator are similar Synchronous Motor Working Principle Working of synchronous motors depends on the interaction of the magnetic field of the stator with the magnetic field of the rotor

## Principle & working of Synchronous generator or Alternator
Machines generating ac EMF are called alternators or synchronous generatorsWhile the machines accepting input from ac supply to produce a mechanical output are called synchronous motorsBoth these machines work at a specific constant speed called synchronous speed and hence is general called synchronous machinSynchronous machines SlideShareMay 27,2014&#0183;&#32;Construction of synchronous machines A synchronous rotor with 8 salient poles Salient pole with field windings Salient pole without field windings observe laminations 20 Two common approaches are used to supply a DC current to the field circuits on the rotating rotor: 1
