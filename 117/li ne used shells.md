## Basis set (chemistry) Wikipedia
2019627&ensp&#0183&enspA basis set in theoretical and computational chemistry is a set of functions (called basis functions) that is used to represent the electronic wave function in the Hartree Fock method or densityfunctional theory in order to turn the partial differential equations of the model into algebraic equations suitable for efficient implementation on a computer.2.13 ionisation energies chemrevise201542&ensp&#0183&enspLi Na K Rb He Ne Ar Kr Xe Notice the drop in ionisation energy down each group As one goes down a group,the outer electrons are found in shells further from the nucleus and are more shielded so the attraction of the nucleus becomes smaller Helium has the biggest first ionisation energy because its first electron is in the first shell closest

## The Li isotope composition of marine biogenic carbonates
1.Introduction.A growing body of evidence suggests that the Li isotope composition of seawater may be a promising proxy for tracing past weathering and hydrothermal conditions at the Earth's surface,because the primary inputs of Li to the oceans are from rivers and the hightemperature hydrothermal flux from ocean ridges (Chan et al.1992,Huh et al.1998,Hathorne and James,2006shells: The amount of shells in atoms?2012214&ensp&#0183&enspI dont knwo how much chemistry you know but,it has to so with the number of electrons in each shell.Si has the the first two shells full and it has 4 electrons the 3rd shell,Ca has the first 3 shells full and 2 electrons in the 4th shell.if you want further explanation i can give it to you.Reply:That refers to atoms' electron configurations.

As shown in,the group 18 atoms helium (He),neon (Ne),and argon (Ar) all have filled outer electron shells,making it unnecessary for them to gain or lose electrons to attain stability they are highly stable as single atoms.Their nonreactivity has resulted in their being named the inert gases (or noble gases).What Is the Symbolism of Seashells?
