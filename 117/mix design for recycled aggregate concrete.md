A.Much of the U.S.research focused on using crushed,hardened concrete as an aggregate in fresh concrete has been in mainline paving.mix design for self compacting concrete prepared with20141031&ensp&#0183&ensp• SCC can be made from any of the constituents that are generally used for structural concrete.In the mix design • of SCC,the relative proportions of key components are generally considered by volume rather than by mass.On • the basis of these proportions,a simple tool has been designed for self compacting concrete (SCC) mix design.

The effects of recycled aggregate replacing levels and cement dosage were analyzed based on compaction test.The results showed that the use of 100% recycled concrete aggregates increased the optimum moisture content and decreased the maximum dry density of base course materials compared to those of natural base materials.Aggregates for Concrete Green Building Design,Products• 'Aggregate' is a term for any particulate material.It includes gravel,crushed stone,sand,slag,recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates.Aggregate may be natural,manufactured or recycled.• Aggregates make up some 60 80% of the concrete mix.They provide compressive strength and bulk to concrete.

## Aggregate in Concrete The Concrete Network
Recycled concrete will have a higher absorption and lower specific gravity than conventional aggregates.To produce good quality,durable concrete containing a portion of recycled concrete aggregate often requires trial concrete mixes and close monitoring of the properties of the old recycled concrete,with mix adjustments made,as needed.Mix Design of Recycled Aggregate Concrete Using20171116&ensp&#0183&enspdensity mix design method,recycled aggregated concrete strengths fluctuation can be resolved,and the concretes can have similar strengths consistency,regardless the recycled concrete aggregate replacement ratios.This method minimise the influence of recycled concrete aggregates obtain from various sources with variable quality.
