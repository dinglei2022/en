## Dielectric Wikipedia
201974&ensp&#0183&enspA dielectric (or dielectric material) is an electrical insulator that can be polarized by an applied electric field.When a dielectric is placed in an electric field,electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in an electrical conductor but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions causing dielectric polarization.What is a Dielectric Constant of Plastic MaterialsWhat is Dielectric Constant? The dielectric constant (Dk) of a plastic or dielectric or insulating material can be defined as the ratio of the charge stored in an insulating material placed between two metallic plates to the charge that can be stored when the insulating material is replaced by vacuum or air.
