20191028&ensp&#0183&enspMilling cutters are cutting tools typically used in milling machines or machining centres to perform milling operations (and occasionally in other machine tools).They remove material by their movement within the machine (e.g.a ball nose mill) or directly from the cutter's shape (e.g.a form tool such as a hobbing cutter).Modelling of tooth trajectory and process geometry in2006323&ensp&#0183&enspin peripheral milling of curved surfaces V.S.Rao,P.V.M.Rao* Mechanical Engineering Department,Indian Institute of Technology Delhi,Hauz Khas,New Delhi 110 016,India Received 20 July 2004 accepted 13 October 2004 Abstract The paper presents modelling of tooth trajectory and process geometry in peripheral milling of curved surfaces.
