## Ore Wikipedia
2019627&ensp&#0183&enspAn ore is a natural occurrence of rock or sediment that contains sufficient minerals with economically important elements,typically metals,that can be economically extracted from the deposit.[1] The ores are extracted at a profit from the earth through mining they are then refined (often via smelting) to extract the valuable element,or19 Flotation of Oxide Copper and Copper Cobalt Ores2016218&ensp&#0183&enspFlotation of Oxide Copper and Copper Cobalt Ores 19.1 INTRODUCTION Flotation practice of oxide copper minerals dates back to almost 60 years ago,and has been applied in Central Africa (Congo) by Union Miniere (Belgium).The process involves two basic flotation methods: (a) fatty acid flotation of oxide copper minerals from siliceous ore,
