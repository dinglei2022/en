## Ultra low sulfur diesel explained
Ultra low sulfur diesel explained.Ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) is diesel fuel with substantially lowered sulfur content.Since 2006,almost all of the petroleum based diesel fuel available in Europe and North America has been of a ULSD type.Infineum Insight Ultra low viscosity challengesTo produce effective low viscosity lubricants,base stocks with lower viscosity,higher viscosity index (VI) and lower volatility are needed.This means the pace at which we move to ultra low viscosity will be heavily influenced by the availability and cost of high quality base stocks.

## TAKING THE MYSTERY OUT OF LUBRICITY Fuel Oil …
Before the advent of ULSD (Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel),defined as diesel fuel having a maximum 15 ppm sulfur content,the characteristic of fuel lubricity was rarely questioned or reported.In fact,diesel specifications provided by refiners to diesel wholesalers and resellers often omitted lubricity …Products Stanadyne Fuel AdditivesReduces Wear: Lubricity improvers restore lubricity to ultra low sulfur and other low lubricity diesel fuels Stabilizes Fuel: Keeps fuel fresher and protects against formations of gums caused by oxidation Cold Weather Protection: Improves diesel pour point up to 40&#176F (22&#176C),and cold filter plug point by up to 25&#176F (13&#176C),depending on
