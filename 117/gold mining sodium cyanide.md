## Cyanide Use in Gold Mining Earthworks
How is cyanide used in mining? A sodium cyanide solution is commonly used to leach gold from ore.There are two types of leaching: Heap leaching: In the open,cyanide solution is sprayed over huge heaps of crushed ore spread atop giant collection pads.The cyanide dissolves the gold from the ore into the solution as it trickles through the heap.Lesson 1 Product Information SHEQMATESodium cyanide solution application and use: Cyanide is used in the mining Industry to extract metals from ore (gold,copper,cadmium,brass and zinc) The principle use of Cyanide is for the extraction of precious metals Cyanide is used for metal plating Cyanide is used for the conservation of wood (As a by product)
