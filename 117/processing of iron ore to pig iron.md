## Iron processing The metal Britannica
Iron processing The metal: Most blast furnaces are linked to a basic oxygen steel plant,for which the hot metal typically contains 4 to 4.5 percent carbon,0.6 to 0.8 percent silicon,0.03 percent sulfur,0.7 to 0.8 percent manganese,and 0.15 percent phosphorus.Tapping temperatures are in the range 1,400&#176 to 1,500&#176 C (2,550&#176 to 2,700&#176 F) to save energy,the hot metal is transferredFOUNDRY PIG IRON2019521&ensp&#0183&ensp3 4 Kobe Steel manufactures foundry pig iron of high quality by dephosphorizing and desulfurization of the hot pig iron.Our foundry pig iron are used widely for a various fields of castings in the manufacturing industry.

## What is Pig Iron? (with pictures) wisegeek
201978&ensp&#0183&enspPig iron is a metal material that results when iron ore,charcoal from coal,and limestone are melted together under intense air pressure.When the combined material cools,it forms a highcarbon product known as pig iron.The cooled material is rarely used by itself,as the large amount of carbon makes the material brittle and unstable.Iron ore Wikipedia2019628&ensp&#0183&enspIron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron,which is one of the main raw materials to make steel—98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel.Indeed,it has been argued that iron ore is &quotmore integral to the global economy than any other commodity,except perhaps oil &quot.

Cast Iron.Cast iron is made when pig iron is remelted in small cupola furnaces (similar to the blast furnace in design and operation) and poured into molds to make castings.It usually contains 2% to 6% carbon.Scrap iron or steel is often added to vary the composition.The production of pig iron from crushing plant waste usingPig iron is a solid form of hot metal,obtained from iron ore or scrap recycling,and it is processed with blast furnace or electric arc furnace.Pig iron is used as a raw material for iron steel making and most of this material was imported.
