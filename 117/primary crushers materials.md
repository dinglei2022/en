## Crusher
Mining operations use crushers,commonly classified by the degree to which they fragment the starting material,with primary and secondary crushers handling coarse materials,and tertiary and quaternary crushers reducing ore particles to finer gradations.Each crusher is designed to work with a certain maximum size of raw maHXJQ PE Jaw Crushers31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;What Is a PE Jaw Crusher.Jaw crusher,also known as jaw breaker or jaw breakers,fulfills the crushing process by simulating the movement of the two jaws of an animal.PE jaw crusher has been widely used in many fields,such as mining,metallurgy,building materials,highway,railway,water conservancy,chemistry and so on.
