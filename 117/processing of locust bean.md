## Development of a locust bean processing device Europe
A locust bean steaming,dehulling and separating machine was designed in this study by simulating the traditional processing operations.The machine consist of pressure cooking pot (as the cooking device) mounted on a separate stand and equipped with rocker arm system to facilitate discharge of contents,a hopper made of mild steel sheet,the dehulling unit made of screwed shaft and abrasiveMoisture dependent mechanical and thermal propertiesMarch,2014 Moisture dependent mechanical and thermal properties of Locust bean (Parkia biglobosa) Vol.16,No.1 101 The shear stress (τ) was calculated as: τ = [w5 (1 w 2)] A (4) 2.4 Maximum rupture force and deformation A preparatory tension compressiontesting machine
