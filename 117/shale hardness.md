## Mohs scale of mineral hardness Simple English Wikipedia
20191127&ensp&#0183&enspMohs' scale of mineral hardness is named after Friedrich Mohs,a mineralogist.Mohs invented a scale of hardness based on how one mineral scratched another.Rocks are made up of one or more minerals.According to the scale,Talc is the softest: it can be scratched by all other materials.Gypsum is harder: it can scratch talc but not calciteThe Effect of Karsting on Natural Fracture,Hardness,and2017831&ensp&#0183&enspThe Effect of Karsting on Natural Fracture,Hardness,and Brittleness of the Hunton Limestone and PaleoDeposition of the Woodford Shale: A
