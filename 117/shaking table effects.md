## Study on effect of soilstructure interaction by
Through comparing the shaking table model test results of dynamic interaction system of soil and highrise structure with those of highrise structure on fixed base,the effects of SoilStructure Interaction (SSI) on dynamic characteristics and seismic response areSeismic Response of Soil Slopes in Shaking Table TestsShaking table tests in this study are 1g model studies carried out on reduced scale models.The stresses and deformations measured in the experiments do not truly represent the stresses and deformations in field because of low confining pressures and boundary effects in model studies.
