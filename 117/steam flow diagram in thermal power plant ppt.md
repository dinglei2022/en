## Steam turbine governing Wikipedia
Steam turbine governing is the procedure of controlling the flow rate of steam to a steam turbine so as to maintain its speed of rotation as constant The variation in load during the operation of a steam turbine can have a significant impact on its performanceChapter 4 Thermodynamics Virginia TechA Simple Steam Power Plant Example In this example we wish to determine the performance of this basic steam power plant under the conditions shown in the diagram,including the power of the turbine and feedwater pump,heat transfer rates of the boiler and condenser,and thermal efficiency of the system
