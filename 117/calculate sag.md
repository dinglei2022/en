## Cable Length Calculator from Sag,Span Easycalculation
Cable length in any transmission line between two point will always be larger than the original length between the two points as there will be certain sag involved.As cable are not stiff object,its natural they have a parabolic shape.This calculator helps you to find cable or conductor length based on the cable span and cable sag.Motorcycle Suspension Sag Adjustment CalculatorFor manual testing and adjustment of a motorcycle's suspension sag,Racetech's method is the most accurate.The geometry in their formula eliminates any marginal grey area by averaging results against oneanother from both directions.

## What is the Sag in Transmission Lines and How to Calculate
The Sag in Transmission Lines is applied to the ground profile by moving the same horizontally while always ensuring that the vertical axis or centerline is held vertical.The sag of high voltage transmission line can simply define as the difference between one level point of and the lowest point of the conductor.Sample Calculation of Sag and Tension of Transmission LineThis is an example calculation for sag and tension in transmission line.You may opt to review first the fundamental principles and formulas from the previous post.Creep is not considered as a factor in final sag in this calculation.

More sag on the front or less sag on the rear will make the bike turn more slowly.Increasing sag will also decrease bottoming resistance,though spring rate has a bigger effect than sag.Racers often use less sag to keep the bike clearance,and since roadraces work greater than we see on the street,they require aCalculate the Sag of Conductors using MATLAB FileThis Live Script shows how to simulate the sag of power line conductors.It allows user to explore the effects of different parameters,such as temperature,conductor type,tension span,etc.on the calculation of points of the enary.The results are visualized in a plot.Submitted as part of the MATLAB Online Live Editor Challenge 2018.

Sag it may only be a three letter word,but it plays a huge role in how your full suspension bike rides.When you sit on your bike,your rear shock will sink a certain amount into it's travel this is referred to as sag.The amount of recommended sag will vary depending on the type of bike that you ride.Typically,How to Determine the Sag in Transmission Lines SciencingTransmission lines do not connect between their supporting towers in a straight line.The shape formed by a line strung between two supports is called a enary.If there is too much tension,the sag will be too little and the line can snap.However,if there is too much sag,it will increase the amount of conductor
