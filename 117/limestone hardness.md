## The Mohs Stone Hardness Scale [Infographic] Ian Knapper
The Measurement of Hardness Scale is a useful tool in quickly determining the hardness of minerals in the field.It also provides insight into the durability of the stones that we work with.The hardness of the stone informs whether it will be suitable to create curved,cantilever or spiral staircases.Indian Limestone Paving,Limestone Paving Slabs Stone …Indian limestone paving slabs have a noble and elegant natural texture and colours with very high density,and its pores are less than other stones,so the hardness is very high with natural surface gloss and anti slip properties.
