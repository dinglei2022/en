Using the basic design of this plant,production capacity can be fairly easily scaled up or down Production can be decreased by operating the plant less often or downscaling equipment In either case,the payback period and or operating costs may be increased over a larger scale operation42 questions with answers in ETHANOL FERMENTATION …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;well i am working with yeast to produce ethanol but i am a little confused what 5% ethanol is i mean how many grams per litre is it equal to and basically using this information.

## Comparative study of experimental beers brewed from millet,
Lager beers brewed from millet and sorghum malts were darker in colour and had a different flavour from beer brewed with barley malt These qualities,which seem to be inherent properties of millet and sorghum,may be associated with the production of opaque beers from these cerealsBioethanol production from spent mushroom compost,Results Sorghum and millet chaff derived spent oyster mushroom composts minus large mycelium particles were assessed at small scale and low substrate concentrations (5% w v) for optimal severity hydrothermal pre treatment,enzyme loading and fermentation with robust yeasts to produce ethanol
