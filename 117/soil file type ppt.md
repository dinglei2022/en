## Types of Pollution PPT PowerPoint Presentation PDF
Types of Pollution PPT PowerPoint Presentation PDF: Distinct types of pollution are classified depending on the affected part of an environment.Each and every type of pollution has its own consequences and its own causes.Study of pollution aids in understanding basics of pollution and also helps to generate set of rules for each and every type of pollution.PowerPoint Presentation THE WATER CYCLEPermeability—the ability of fluids (commonly water and oil) to flow through a material (rock or soil) Ice often causes the ground to be impermeable Water cannot seep into the frozen ground Surface Runoff is more likely to occur when the ground is frozen Infiltration is when water absorbs into the soil by seeping into pore spaces in the soil.
