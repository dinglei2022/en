## Mineral Sands An Overview of the Industry AusIMM
Mineral sands orebodies essentially fall into two egories based on the mode of deposition: alluvial or aeolian.Alluvial deposits are further split into marine beach placers (or strandlines) and lacustrine heavy mineral (HM) accumulations.Exploration for mineral sands involves the positive identifiion of keyMineral Sands Tronox201978&ensp&#0183&enspMineral sands are within a class of ore deposits that contain heavy minerals such as ilmenite,zircon,leucoxene,and rutile.The most important,naturally occurring minerals that are mined to produce titanium dioxide (TiO 2) feedstock are ilmenite,leucoxene and rutile.The minerals are either used as feedstock in their natural form or in an upgraded form,such as synthetic rutile and titania
