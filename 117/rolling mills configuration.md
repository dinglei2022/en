## Fundamentals of Roll Cooling and Control of Flatness at.
In the process of Rolling the most significant aspect is the generation of heat through friction and deformation in the roll bite and in a typical Cold Tandem Mill,work roll temperatures normally fall in the range of 55oC 70oC with strip recoil temperatures and intRolling processesRolling processes 5 1 introduction: Rolling is the process of reducing the thickness or changing the cross section of a long workpiece by compressive forces applied through a set of rolls,as shown in figure (5 1).Fig.(5 1) Most rolling is carried out by hot working,called hot rolling,owing to the large amount of deformation required.
