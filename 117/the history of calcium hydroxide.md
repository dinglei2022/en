## Direct and Indirect Pulp Capping: A Brief History,
Calcium hydroxide has traditionally been considered the "gold standard" and is the most commonly used material in this regard 41 This is partly because of its ability to dissociate into calcium and hydroxyl ions,its high pH,antibacterial properties,and apparent ability to stimulate odontoblasts and other pulp cells in various ways to form.Comparative evaluation of the pH of calcium hydroxide,The results demonstrated that in the presence of CO 2,calcium hydroxide showed a marked loss of [OH ] and [Ca ++] in relation to the decrease in pH However,the high alkaline pH of the calcium hydroxide powder was preserved in the absence of CO 2,
