## DEVELOPMENT OF ALUMINUM DROSS BASED MATERIAL …
6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;aluminum industry produces approximately 3.2 million tons of dross annually from domestic aluminum smelting.Most of the interest has been on the recovery of the aluminum content of the dross,as white dross can reach as high as 80wt%.In order to recover the metallic aluminum,dross is heating in a rotating furnace with a salt flux introduced.How aluminum is made material,manufacture,making,used.Aluminum manufacture is accomplished in two phases: the Bayer process of refining the bauxite ore to obtain aluminum oxide,and the Hall Heroult process of smelting the aluminum oxide to release pure aluminum.Its chemical properties make it effective in many other applications,including catalytic converters and explosives.It is even used.
