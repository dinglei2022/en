## Steelmaking Wikipedia
20191130&ensp&#0183&enspSteelmaking is the process of producing steel from iron ore and or scrap.In steelmaking,impurities such as nitrogen,silicon,phosphorus,sulfur and excess carbon (most important impurity) are removed from the sourced iron,and alloying elements such as manganese,nickel,chromium,carbon and vanadium are added to produce different grades of steel.Iron Production Chemistry LibreTextsThe production of iron from its ore involves an oxidationreduction reaction carried out in a blast furnace.Iron ore is usually a mixture of iron and vast quantities of impurities such as sand and clay referred to as gangue.The iron found in iron ores are found in the form of iron oxides.
