## Carbonization of Coal for Metallurgical Coke,
Since the by products are not recovered,the process is called non recovery coke making In these batteries usually the waste gas exits into a waste heat recovery boiler which converts the excess heat into steam for power generation hence this the process is also called heat recovery coke makingLecture 2 Coal Carbonization and Coke Oven Plant,Lecture 2 Coal Carbonization and Coke Oven Plant 59 Lecture 2 COAL CARBONIZATION AND COKE OVEN PLANT Coal carbonization is used for processing of coal to produce coke using metallurgical grade coal,Coke making through by product recovery Coke making through non recovery heat recovery
