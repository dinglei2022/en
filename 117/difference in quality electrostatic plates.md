## Potential Difference between two parallel charged plates
Oct 29,2015&nbsp&#0183&#32Where E is the electric field between the two plates.And d is the distance of seperation of plates.And by a direct solution I meant finding the potential difference just by using the variables,charge Q on the plate,the distance of seperation d between the plates and Area A of the plate.And yeah it may include the use of Integration.Electric Potentialat the positive plate,and.V = zero at the negative plate.Question: instead of knowing q,what if we simply know that the potential difference between the plates is 10 volts.What is the electric field strength if the plate separation is 1 cm? A: V = Ed in this case,so E = 10 volts cm = 1000 N C

## Electric Griddle vs.Gas Griddle: What's the Difference
Electric griddles usually have a heating element that is embedded into the griddle plate.They heat the surface similar to a gas griddle,but they do so more slowly and often more easily.An electric griddle will allow you to be more precise with your temperature changes.An electric griddle is also a better idea for people who live in apartments.Electric Potential in a Uniform Electric Field PhysicsFind the maximum potential difference between two parallel conducting plates separated by 0.500 cm of air,given the maximum sustainable electric field strength in air to be 3.0 &#215 10 6 V m.A doubly charged ion is accelerated to an energy of 32.0 keV by the electric field between two parallel conducting plates separated by 2.00 cm.
