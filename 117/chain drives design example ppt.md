## Chain drive machine component Britannica
Chain drive: Chain drive,Device widely used for the transmission of power where shafts are separated at distances greater than that for which gears are practical In such cases,sprockets (wheels with teeth shaped to mesh with a chain) take the place of gears and drive one another by means of a chain passingChain Drives Industrial Wiki odesie by Tech TransferChain Drive Advantag Chain drives,unlike belt drives,do not slip or creep,Adding the suffix ΑH to standard roller chain numbers indicates a heavy series chain Example: 60H = 3 4 inch pitch,heavy series roller chain,This silent chain design is used for serpentine drives.
