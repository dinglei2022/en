## Polysaccharide Wikipedia
2019627&ensp&#0183&enspAqueous solutions of the polysaccharide alone have a curious behavior when stirred: after stirring ceases,the solution initially continues to swirl due to momentum,then slows to a standstill due to viscosity and reverses direction briefly before stopping.This recoil is due to the elastic effect of the polysaccharide chains,previouslyFood Thickeners Guar Gum Carboxy Methyl CelluloseGuar gum is a cold water soluble polysaccharide,and carries a wide range of uses in the food industry.These uses depend on the properties provided by very large molecules in various states of hydration,mostly in solution.Guar gum hydrates very easily to produce an aqueous solution possessing a high viscosity at low gum concentrations.
