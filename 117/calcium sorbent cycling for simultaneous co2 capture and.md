Calcium based solid sorbents has been widely applied for the removal of acid gases,such as sulfur dioxide (SO 2),sulfur trioxide (SO 3),and hydrochloric acid (HCl),from coal fired flue gas.Amid possible carbon dioxide (CO 2) regulations,scientists have explored ways to extend this technology for CO 2 removal especially from sizable point sources at low cost.Development of sintering resistant CaO based sorbent.This improved CO2 absorption performance was attributed to the particular morphologies of the CaO based sorbents.Additionally,during absorption desorption cycles the occurrence of Ca12Al14O33 phase is considered to be responsible for the excellent CO2 absorption performance of CaO based sorbents.In the meanwhile,the use of solid waste.

## Reactivation of Limestone Derived Sorbents using Hydration.
A simple method of CO 2 capture is by using the calcium looping cycle.The calcium looping cycle uses CaCO 3 as a CO 2 carrier,via the reversible reaction CaO(s) + CO 2 (g) = CaCO 3 (s),to extract CO2 from the exhaust stream and provide a pure stream of CO 2 suitable for sequestration.CO2 Capture.Oxy fuel Combustion Research Groups and.Carbon dioxide (CO 2) and sulphur dioxide.However,sulphur capture by calcium compounds is a process highly dependent on the temperature and CO2 concentration.In addition,because the characteristics of the calcium sorbent (as specific surface area,pore size,composition,etc.) have a very strong influence on the rate of sulphation.

## Highly efficient CO2 capture with simultaneous iron and.
An efficient CO2 capture process has been developed by integrating calcium looping (CaL) and waste recycling technologies into iron and steel production.A key advantage of such a process is that CO2 capture is accompanied by simultaneous iron and CaO recycling from waste steel slag.
