## AbrasionResistant Rubber
201976&ensp&#0183&enspRubber abrasion resistance is the ability of the rubber to withstand such abrasive wear.Some forms of tough rubber excel in providing protection against abrasions,making them perfect for certain projects.Generally,abrasion is far more likely to occur when motion is involved,as this creates a greater rate of frictioninduced wear.Abrasion Resistant Sheet Rubber GCP Industrial Products201979&ensp&#0183&enspPremlene™ Abrasion Resistant Sheet is a robust material which possesses excellent abrasion resistance properties.These properties allow it to excel in appliions where excessive cuts,abrasion or wear &amp tear occur.Another benefit to this sheet is its cushioning resistance ability making it suitable for some matting appliions.Available in Red and Tan color at 40 Duro.

201979&ensp&#0183&enspRubber Abrasion Resistance and the Tensile Strength of Rubber.One of the most important qualities of rubber is its durability.People often think of rubber as being a more elastic type of material and tend to overlook the fact that some sheet rubber products out there are very durable.Which Elastomer Offers The Best Abrasion Resistance?Which Elastomer Offers The Best Abrasion Resistance? When choosing the right base elastomer for use for any particular appliion,one of the primary considerations for many dynamic appliions is the abrasion resistance the ability to resist mechanical actions such as rubbing,scraping or erosion which removes material from the surface.
