## Sodium aluminium hydride Wikipedia
Sodium aluminium hydride is a strong reducing agent,very similar in reactivity to lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) and,to some extent,Diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL) in organic reactions It is much more powerful reducing agent than sodium borohydride due to the weaker and more polar Al H bond compared to the B H bondTitanium Hydroxide AMERICAN ELEMENTSTitanium Hydroxide Ti(OH)4 bulk & research qty manufacturer Properties,SDS,Applications,Price Free samples program Term contracts & credit cards PayPal accepted
