## Glass production Wikipedia
Batch processing system (batch house) Batch processing is one of the initial steps of the glass making process The batch house simply houses the raw materials in large silos (fed by truck or railcar) and holds anywhere from 1 5 days of materialHow to select the perfect binder for shaped refractory,The characteristic properties of each refractory class are a function of both their raw material base and the methods used to manufacture the refractory products Shaped Refractory manufacturing involves five processes: raw material processing,raw material mixing,forming,drying and firing
