## Molecular vibration Wikipedia
20191113&ensp&#0183&enspA molecular vibration is a periodic motion of the atoms of a molecule relative to each other,such that the center of mass of the molecule remains unchanged.The typical frequencies of molecular motions,known as the vibrational frequencies,range from less than 10 13 Hz to approximately 10 14 Hz,corresponding to wavenumbers of approximately 300 to 3000 cm −1.Dynamic Modeling of a Vibrating Screen Considering the2018914&ensp&#0183&enspIt is concluded that the linear dynamic model used in Case 2 is adequate to evaluate the influence of the ore on the movement of the vibrating screen.The linear dynamic model considering the force as in Case 1 can be used to simulate a vibrating screen,as long as a correct calibration parameter is included to obtain an accurate motion amplitude.
