Other carbonate grains comprising limestones are ooids,peloids,intraclasts,and extraclasts.Limestone often contains variable amounts of silica in the form of chert (chalcedony,flint,jasper,etc.) or siliceous skeletal fragment (sponge spicules,diatoms,radiolarians),and varying amounts of clay,silt and sand (terrestrial&nbsp;.3.3 Raw Materials for Cement ManufactureClays are ideal because they are made of fine particles already and thus need little processing prior to use,and are the most common source of silica and alumina.Calcium is most often obtained from quarried rock,particularly limestone (calcium carbonate) which must be crushed and ground before entering the kiln.
