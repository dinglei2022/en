## Vertical Coal Mill
vertical Coal mill adopts directing grinding with roller on top of grinding table for direct grinding,with high grinding efficiency,low energy consumption and guaranteed product.With continuous development of vertical mill technology,the roller route design is perfect,and it forms material layer easier than ordinary vertical roller,the.PulverizerSimilar to the ring and ball mill,the vertical spindle roller mill uses large &quot;tires&quot; to crush the coal.These mills are usually found in utility plants.Raw coal is gravity fed through a central feed pipe to the grinding table where it flows outwardly by centrifugal action and is ground between the rollers and table.
