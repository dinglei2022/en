## What is the function of a sand layer underlying paving …
The sand layer serves the same purpose of normal blinding layer under concrete structure: (i) Provide a level and flat surface for the paving slab interlocking blocks to lay on; (ii) Protect the foundation (i.e.underground subgrade and sub base layer) against adverse outside conditions (e.g.bad weather) during construction of the laying work of paving slab interlocking blocks.Concrete blocks21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Concrete blocks sand cement blocks.Contents Previous Next.It is faster to build with concrete blocks than with bricks and the amount of mortar is reduced to less than half.If face shell bedding is used,in which the mortar is placed only along the edges of the blocks,the consumption of mortar is reduced by a further 50%.

## Sand Extraction: 1.Introduction
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Introduction.Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction.In the preparation of concrete,for each tonne of cement,the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS,2013b).Thus,the world’s use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.concrete Definition,Composition,Uses,&amp; Facts BritannicaConcrete,in construction,structural material consisting of a hard,chemically inert particulate substance,known as aggregate (usually sand and gravel),that is bonded together by cement and water.Learn more about concrete,including its history and uses.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time.In the past limebased cement binders were often used,such as lime putty,but sometimes with other hydraulic cements,such as a calcium aluminate cement or with Portland cement to form Portland cement concrete (for its visual resemblance to.Floors Functional Requirements in Building ConstructionFor small domestic building concrete without reinforcement might be enough but for large loads like heavy equipment or machinery reinforced concrete slab is needed.Additionally,suspension reinforced concrete slabs are necessary on shrinkable soil against soil differential contraction of expansion,specifically in situations where deep rooted trees are close to the site.
