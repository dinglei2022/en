Clarifiers are settling tanks built with mechanical means for continuous removal of solids being deposited by sedimentation.[1] A clarifier is generally used to remove solid particulates or suspended solids from liquid for clarifiion and (or) thickening.Concentrated impurities,discharged from the bottom of the tank are known as sludge,while the particles that float to the surface of theOperating charts for continuous sedimentation I: ControlThe industrial process of continuous sedimentation of solid particles in a liquid takes place in a clarifierthickener unit,which is a large tank with a feed inlet somewhere in
