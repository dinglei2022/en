CONCLUSION Cement is a binder,a substance that sets and hardens independently,and can bind other materials together.It was first made by Joseph Aspdin in 1824 in England.It is Classified as Natural Cement,Pozzolana Cement,Slag Cement,Portland Cement.Portland cement is most commonly used.Its manufacturing process consists of CrushingCement Concrete: Advantages and Disadvantages Concrete,Concrete has following disadvantages: 1 Its tensile strength is very low of the order of 10% of the compressive strength Thus it develops cracks To avoid the development of cracks,steel is used as reinforcement 2 Due to rise in temperature,concrete expands and due to fall in temperature it shrinks
