As nitrogen gradually diffuses out of the bubble,it creates a similar partial pressure deficit.But there is very little dissolved nitrogen present in water (it has a lower solubility potential than oxygen),so some of the nitrogen's partial pressure deficit is "corrected" by oxygen.Oxygen Plants India,Cryogenic Oxygen Plant,Liquid Oxygen2019314&ensp&#0183&enspoxygen plants.Working on low pressure technology,our oxygen plant produces oxygen from atmospheric air at the purity of upto 99.7%.In addition,the plant also offers nitrogen purity of upto 99.99%.We incorporate turbine expander and rotary air compressor from Atlas Copco,Belgium aiming to reach the pinnacle of perfection in our industry.
