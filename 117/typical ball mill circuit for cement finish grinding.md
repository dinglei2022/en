## Ball mill for cement mill India Business 20676
The existing globe consumption of cement is about 1.5 billion tonnes per annum and it is actually rising at about 1% per annum.The XSM ball mill is developed for grinding of clinker,gypsum and dry or moist additives to any sort of cement.Stage 4: Finish Process Cement ProductionClosed circuit systems.The efficiency of the early stages of grinding in a ball mill is much greater than that for formation of ultra fine particles,so ball mills operate most efficiently by making a coarse product,the fine fractions of this then being separated,and the coarse part being returned to the mill inlet.
