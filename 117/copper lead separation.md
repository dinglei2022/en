## methods of separating copper from liquid lead pyrometallurgy
The separation of metallic zinc from its ores by pyrometallurgy is much more difficult than with other common metals,such as copper,lead,and iron,because the reduction of zinc oxide by carbon (C) proceeds spontaneously only above the zinc boiling point of 907 &#176;C (1,665 &#176;F)china high quality lead and copper separating equipmentsgold,lead zinc ore concentration,China Gold flotation machine for Ores concentrate separation plant Mining copper lead zinc For Separating Gold,Silver,Lead Zinc.

This is now seldom used,as the preferred technique is to float a bulk copper lead concentrate selectively with depression of zinc and iron,followed by reflotation of the copper lead tailing for recovery of zinc[9] The polymetallic separation flowsheet of copper lead bulk flotation copper lead separation,Separation of Lead and Silver? Sciencemadness · Separation of Lead and Silver?.to that solution add sodium carbonate at 35 40 C to precipitate lead,copper.This is a fairly simple separation method.

## Can anybody give me some ideas to separate copper and lead?
Lead and copper are routinely separated using two stages of flotation,ie first the copper or lead is recovered to produce a concentrate,then a second stage of flotation to recover the other.Copper Lead Zinc ores Danafloat HomeCopper Lead Zinc ores.The Cu Pb Zn separation process is among the most challenging flotation separations primarily because the first step must entail bulk flotation of the two most readily floatable minerals with these two minerals separated in a differential flotation stage.In this case,as a general rule because both copper and lead.

At Mount Isa,the copper ore bodies are separate from the lead zinc silver ore bodies,thus enabling independent production of the two ore types.Development and introduction of a new copper lead,Development and introduction of a new copper lead separation method in the Raura plant (Peru) 1491 CONCLUSIONS Y The copper lead separation method based on lead depression and copper flotation from bulk concentrate containing secondary copper minerals,using standard lead depressants such as starches,dextrins and dichromates,is not effective.
