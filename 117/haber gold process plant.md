## Greening Ammonia toward the Solar Ammonia Refinery: Joule
Similar to Yara,the H 2 comes from water electrolysis using renewable electricity,the N 2 is obtained from the air,and the ammonia is produced with the obtained renewable H 2 and N 2 via a HaberBosch process.The capacity of the ammonia plant is expected to be around 610 tons of liquid ammonia per day.Industrial processes Wikipedia20191023&ensp&#0183&enspIndustrial processes are procedures involving chemical,physical,electrical or mechanical steps to aid in the manufacturing of an item or items,usually carried out on a very large scale.Industrial processes are the key components of heavy industry.

## Greening Ammonia toward the Solar Ammonia Refinery
It is well known that the centuryold HaberBosch process,N 2 + 3H 2 → 2NH 3,is thermally powered by fossil energy,resulting in a greenhouse gas intensive process,which needs to be replaced by one driven instead by renewable energy.To address this issue,we need to replace the energyintensive synthesis process of ammonia from N 2 and H 2 by one powered instead by renewable electricity.The HaberBosch Process — Institute for Mindful AgricultureHaber achieved this in 1909 at the University of Karlsruhe in Germany,initially using Osmium as a alyst (Hager,2006).In 1913 Carl Bosch succeeded in the industrial scaling of this invention at BASF in Ludwigshafen,Germany,therefore the `double' name HaberBosch process.
