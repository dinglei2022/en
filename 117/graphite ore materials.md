*Synthetic graphite is a manufactured product made by hightemperature treatment of amorphous carbon materials.In the United States,the primary feedstock used for making synthetic graphite is calcined petroleum coke and coal tar pitch.This makes it very expensive to produce — up to 10 times the cost of natural graphite and lessgraphite foil,graphite plate,graphene film,natural2019618&ensp&#0183&enspThe raw material of natural graphite film comes from natural graphite ore,which is totally different from synthetic graphite.Its process is that natural graphite ore is crushed,screened,purified,floated,sintered and calendered,with a carbon content of 99.9~99.99%.
