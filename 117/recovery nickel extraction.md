## Recovery of nickel from electroplating wastewater …
Nickel is one of the most important strategic metals.With the depletion of high grade nickel sulfide ores,electroplating wastewater as a kind of secondary resources,its utilization has great significance in nickel recycling industries.A novel extractant,[( ethyl hexylamino) pyridin yl methyl] phosphonic acid diethyl ester (L) was synthesized and used with D2EHPA (di ethyl hexyl.Cobalt extractionCobalt extraction refers to the techniques used to extract cobalt from its ores and other compound ores.Several methods exist for the separation of cobalt from copper and nickel.They depend on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used ore.
