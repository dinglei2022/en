What is it? First formed more than 300 million years ago,zeolite is a mineral mostly made up of silica (the third most abundant trace element in the human body) and alumina tetrahedra.There are many natural variations,each one unique to its environment.Some formed when volcanic rocks and ash reacted with seawater others are freshwater variations.Skills:Resource Processing UniWiki Eve University2019621&ensp&#0183&enspSpecialization in reprocessing of the most common forms of ore extracted from New Eden's moons.Allows a skilled individual to utilize reprocessing facilities at considerably greater efficiency.2% bonus to Zeolites,Sylvite,Bitumens,and Coesite reprocessing yield per skill level.
