## How to Recognize Hard Rock Gold Ores ICMJs Prospecting.
How to Recognize Hard Rock Gold Ores.September 2017 by Chris Ralph.I regularly get inquiries along the line of: “Hey,I found this rock,and I think it might be gold ore.How can I tell?” Prospectors are always on the lookout for gold bearing rocks that may be the source of any nearby placer gold.Hard Rock Mining Gold and Silver Ore and processing itHard Rock Mining For Gold and Silver Ores.The exact processes which are to be used depend on what type of sulfides are present in the ore.In most gold ores,the final process to extract the tiniest gold particles is the use of cyanide to dissolve the gold.Cyanide,in the presence of oxygen actually dissolves both gold and silver.

## How Are Diamonds Mined And Extracted From the Ground
To make mining efficient and effective,the raw rock and soil are typically not examined on site.Instead,they are transported to special plants where the ore is processed and the rough diamonds are extracted.Depending on how rich the ore is,a few hundred tons of ore might be sieved just to produce a single carat of gem quality rough diamonds.Processing,smelting and refining gold World Gold Council201978&ensp&#0183&enspWhen gold dissolution is complete,the goldbearing solution is separated from the solids.With ores of higher gold content (greater than 20 grams of gold per tonne of ore),cyanidation is accomplished by vat leaching,which involves holding a slurry of ore and solvent in large tanks equipped with agitators.
