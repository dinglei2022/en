Optimizing the Use of Fly Ash in Concrete CONCRETE Introduction Fly ash is used as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM) in the production of portland cement.COAL ASH PROPERTIES &amp; IMPACT ON CLINKER …The impact of using high CaO flyash (ie Class C ash) in cement is likely to improve the strength development of the PPC due in part to the pozzolanic reaction,but more so since high CaO ashes contain increased quantities of calcium silicates and aluminates,(identical to those found in clinker),which give cement made with these ashes a degree.

The continuous hydration of cement leads to the constant increase of Ca(OH) 2 content,but the pozzolanic reaction of fly ash will consume some Ca(OH) 2.A large number of studies [29,30] have shown that the reaction degree of fly ash at the age of 3 days is generally less than 5% and at the age of 7 days less than 10%.It can be referred from Table 2 that Ca(OH) 2 content of FA % and GFA %.Effect of Activated Flyash in Metakaolin based cement2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;types of cement were prepared and same were used to find compressive strength of concrete cubes at 3,7,14,28 and 56 days.Keywords— Compressive strength,Activated Flyash,Metakaolin,Iron Oxide,Workability I.INTRODUCTION Concrete has played important role in infrastructure development.Concrete has many advantages over other

## Fly Ash for Use in Concrete A Critical Review
Fly ash used as a pozzolan to replace some of the portland cement in concrete often achieves energy and cost savings and imparts specific engineering properties to the finished product.To use fly ash effectively and economically it is important to understand the differences between fly ash and portland cement concretes.Modeling of Sulfate Resistance of Flyash Blended Cement.3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;It is observed that replacing the cement with 30% Class F flyash (FA1) decreased the total expansion of standard size specimens by about 40% after 6 months of exposure.Note that at 20% substitution rate,FA2 (not classified) decreased the expansion by 20%,however,at 30% replacement level; this flyash increased the expansion by 60%.

19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Coal fly ash,a burnt residue of pulverized coal,is hazardous and its disposal is a problem.In Bangladesh,the annual generation of this waste is approximately 0.6 million tons.On a global basis,less than 20 percent of coal fly ash (CFA) is used in the concrete related applications while the remainder is disposed of in landfills leading to various environmental problems such as polluting.Fly Ash in Concrete Part I Concrete Construction,Fly ash is a by product of the burning of pulverized coal in power plants It is removed by mechanical collectors or electrostatic precipitators as fine particles from the combustion gases before they are discharged into the atmosphere Added to concrete,fly ash plays the dual role of fine.
