## Technical Features and Research Progress of Separating
In order to meet the demand for high purity tantalum and niobium products and to adapt to the complexity of tantalum niobium ore and waste in smelting,it was necessary to prepare high pure tantalum (niobium) oxide by traditional technology.In this paper,the process features,principles and functions of the decomposition,extraction,neutralization,washing and calcination in the traditionalTantalum Element information,properties and usesTantalum is sometimes,but only rarely,found uncombined in nature.It occurs mainly in the mineral columbitetantalite,which also contains other metals including niobium.It is mined in many places including Australia,Canada and Brazil.There are several complied steps involved in separating the tantalum from the niobium.
