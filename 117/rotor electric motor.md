DETERMINING ELECTRIC MOTOR LOAD AND EFFICIENCY Most likely your operation’s motors account for a large part of your monthly electric bill.Far too often motors are mismatched—or oversized—for the load they are intended to serve,or have been re wound multiple times.An introduction to electric motors stThe electric motor operation is based on the following points: •At least one of the two magnetic field is generated by a solenoid carrying a current.•The phase relation between the rotor and stator magnetic field (i.e.the load angle) must be always greater than 0&#176in order to keep the motor in motion (negative angles reverse the rotation).
