## Strength Characteristics of Quarry Dust in Replacement of
The replacement of natural fine aggregate by using quarry dust leads to consumption of generated quarry dust,the requirement of land fill area can be reduced and solves the natural sand scarcity problem.The sand availability as a fine aggregate at low cost which needs the reason toComparative Study of Effect of Silica Fume and …addition of quarry dust to fresh concrete increases the water demand and consequently the cement content for given workability and strength requirement.
