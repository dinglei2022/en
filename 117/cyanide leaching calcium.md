## Effect of pH Alkalinity on Gold Leaching
201977&ensp&#0183&enspThe role pH has in affecting gold leaching rates by cyanide and the functions of calcium hydroxide in cyanidation are as follow: 1.For safety and to prevent loss of cyanide by hydrolysis.2.To prevent loss of cyanide by the action of carbon dioxide in the air.3.To decompose bicarbonates in mill water before using it in cyanidation.4.To neutralize acidic compounds such as ferrous saltsGold Leaching by Sodium Chloride and Calcium HypochloriteAmong such alternative reagents is the combination of chloride and hypochlorite ions due to their oxidation of metallic gold and its complexation.Therefore,the current work aims at investigating gold leaching from an oxidized material by means of a solution comprising calcium
