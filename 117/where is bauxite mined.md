## The Chemistry and Processing of Jamaican Bauxite
The first commercial extraction of alumina (Al 2 O 3) from bauxite has been attributed to Henri Sainte Claire Deville in about 1854.Soon after this,in 1888,Karl Joseph Bayer described what is now known as the Bayer Process,which led to a dramatic reduction in the.Bauxite Geoscience AustraliaMore than 85% of the bauxite mined globally is converted to alumina for the production of aluminium metal.An additional 10% goes to non metal uses in various forms of specialty alumina,while the remainder is used for non metallurgical bauxite applications.
