## Lithium Ion vs Lithium Iron Batteries Newcastle Systems
Aug 20,2015&nbsp&#0183&#32Lithium batteries stand apart from other batteries in their high charge density (long life) and high cost per unit.What are the major differences between the battery you are familiar with,the Lithium Ion (LiCoO2) and the new kid on the block,Lithium Iron (LiFePO4)?A lithium ion is different than a lithium atom because itThe question is asking why a lithium ion is different from a lithium atom.The correct option is C.Lithium has an atomic number of 3,which means that a lithium atom has three electrons.During chemical reactions,lithium usually donate one electron to other elements there by becoming a positively charged ion.
