A comparative study of linear observers applied to a DC servo motor Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of six different linear observers.The studied observers are Luenberger Observer,Kalman (Filter) Observer,Unknown Input Observer,Augmented Robust Observer,High Gain Observer and Sensitive High Gain Observer.Difference Between DC Motor,Servo Motor And SteppperOverall,the motors like DC,servo,and stepper motors are best for different appliions.But,the stepper motor is well suited for high holding torque and lower acceleration appliions.Many are under the misunderstanding that there is a huge difference between DC motor,servo motor,and stepper motor.

## DC Motors vs.Servo Motors
The servo motor will naturally beat the DC motor in terms of efficiency,as the precision electronics regulate the current and minimize losses.An interesting note: even when a servo motor is not in use,it still pulls a current because of its feedback encoders,which means servo motors must always be powered to some capacity.DC Servo Motors Theory of DC Servo Motor5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;As we know that any electrical motor can be utilized as servo motor if it is controlled by servomechanism.Likewise,if we control a DC motor by means of servomechanism,it would be referred as DC servo motor.There are different types of DC motor,such shunt wound DC motor,series DC motor,Separately excited DC motor,permanent magnet DC motor,Brushless DC motor etc.
