## A rapid centrifugalflotation technique for separating
Soil samples of 100 to 500 ml.are washed through a 20mesh sieve into a 2gallon bucket.After half filling with water,the mixture is well stirred and then allowed to stand for about 30 sec.before decanting through a 270 or 325mesh sieve.This is done twice and the residue on the sieve collected in a beaker the remaining soil is discarded.Separating Mixtures Physical Separation Chemistry2019710&ensp&#0183&enspIf one component is more soluble in a mixture and other less at a known temperature,this technique can be used to separate them.Electrical and Magnetism separation Electrolytes and nonelectrolytes along with magnet and nonmagnetic substances can be separated using this technique of separation under electrical field or magnetic field.

A coal flotation technology comprises the following steps: coal slime pulp is graded and separated to obtain overflow coal slime and underflow coal slime and the overflow coal slime is taken as the sole flotation feeding material to undergo the flotation,wherein the grain size of the overflow coal slime is 0.5 to 0mm.The concentration of the overflow coal slime is 60 to 80g l.Separation Techniques: Sublimation,Decanting and2019623&ensp&#0183&enspThe vapour changes back to solid directly on a cold surface.The sand is not affected by the heat and remains in the beaker.Other substances that sublime include carbon dioxide,anhydrous iron (III) chloride,anhydrous aluminium chloride and some ammounium compounds.As only a few solids sublime,this method of separation is limited.
