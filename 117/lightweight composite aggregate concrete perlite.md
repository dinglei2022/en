## Ultra lightweight concrete: Conceptual design and.
Ultra lightweight concrete: Conceptual design and performance evaluation.of expanded perlite aggregate concrete with mineral admixtures.They reported that silica fume and ﬂy ash used as cement replace ment can decrease the thermal conductivity up to 15%,while the density and compressive strength of the concrete is also reduced,up to 30%.Ünal et al.[9] developed a lightweight.Lightweight Aggregate Concrete ScienceDirectThis chapter presents an overview of lightweight aggregate (LWA) concrete.Lightweight aggregates can originate from natural resources,or they can be man made.Lightweight aggregates are made by a thermal process using natural materials such as clay,shale,slate,perlite,and vermiculite.Concrete can be considered as a particulate.
