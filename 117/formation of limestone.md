## Limestone: The Calcium Carbonate Chemical Sedimentary Rock
&quot;Limestone&quot; means any rock formed mostly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3),but to geologists,limestone is only one of several types of &quot;carbonate rocks.&quot; These rocks are composed of more than 50% carbonate minerals,generally the minerals calcite (pure CaCO3) or dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate,CaMg[CO3]2)&nbsp;.What Are the Characteristics of Limestone? Reference.comLimestone erosion is responsible for the formation of some of the world's most spectacular cavern systems and cave formations.As calcium laden water drips from cavern ceilings,some calcium is left behind each droplet,while some drips to the floor with the water.
