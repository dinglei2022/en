## Potash Production ArrMaz
Potash Production.Potash is the term commonly used to refer to the nutrient forms of the element potassium (K).Potassium is plentiful in nature and is required for many of the vital functions that occur in plants,animals and humans.Potash Statistics and Information usgs.govPotash is used primarily as an agricultural fertilizer (plant nutrient) because it is a source of soluble potassium,one of the three primary plant nutrients the others are fixed nitrogen and soluble phosphorus.Potash and phosphorus are mined products,and fixed nitrogen is produced from the atmosphere by using industrial processes.

A problem with their production has been that the potash content is always weak (usually only about 1 2% KCl),and thus a solar evaporation,or expensive plant evaporation step,was first required.Also,the brines always contain many other ions,thus compliing the separation of potash from the evaporated brine or crystallized salts.SOPerior Fertilizer HomeSOPerior Fertilizer is a near term producer of premium fertilizer with world class development assets in Utah and Quebec.Potash Ridge is a Canadian based exploration and development company with a unique opportunity to develop a mine and processing facility to produce sulphate of potash "SOP&quot.
