## Specific Heat Capacity Definition ThoughtCo
Specific heat capacity is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a substance per unit of mass.The specific heat capacity of a material is a physical property.It is also an example of an extensive property since its value is proportional to the size of the system being examined.Making Accurate DSC and MDSC Specific Heat Capacity2000831&ensp&#0183&enspnow possible to measure Heat Capacity in a single run with an accuracy typically better than &#177 5 %.The technique for making such measurements is described.INTRODUCTION The Q1000 DSC signals include heat flow and heat capacity as measured in the standard mode plus reversing heat capacity as measured by Modulated DSC (MDSC&#174).

## What Instruments Are Used to Measure Heat? Sciencing
The thermometer is humanity's oldest heatmeasuring tool,dating all the way back to the 1600s.Today,different kinds of thermometers can measure everything from outdoor temperature to the temperature of cooked meat.Other tools can measure the heat of entire buildings or even the amount of energy in food by producing heat reactions.What is specific heat measured in? SocraticSpecific heat represents the amount of heat required to change a unit mass of a substance by one degree Celsius.This is expressed mathematically as: q = m * c * DeltaT,where q the amount of heat supplied m the mass of the substance c the respective substance's specific heat DeltaT the change in temperature.So,if we want to determine the units for specific heat,we'll just
