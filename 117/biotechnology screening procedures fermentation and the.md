## Correlation between Agar Plate Screening and Solid State.
31 Oct 2012.Thus,there is a growing demand for the development of efficient procedures for selection of cellulase producing microorganisms.This work correlates qualitative screening using agar plate assays with quantitative measurements of cellulase production during cultivation under solid state fermentation (SSF)&nbsp;.Biotechnology WikipediaThe wide concept of "biotech" or "biotechnology" encompasses a wide range of procedures for modifying living organisms according to human.Fermentation was also used in this time period to produce leavened bread.Although the process of fermentation was not fully understood until Louis Pasteur's work in 1857,it is still the first use of.
