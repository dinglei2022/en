A concrete block wall can be laid in less time and may cost up to half as much as a similar brick wall.The concrete blocks are generally made using concrete which is a mixture of powdered Portland cement,water,MSand,and gravel.Concrete blocks are used extensively for both load bearing and non load bearing walls,externally and internally.Concrete Masonry blocks Solid,Hollow,Thermal,Hourdi,Concrete masonry solid blocks are manufactured with 2150 Kg m3 density for normal weight blocks and 1100 Kg m3 density for light weight concrete blocks It is the most commonly used masonry unit after hollow blocks
