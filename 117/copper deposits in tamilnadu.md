## Nanonickel copper alloy deposit for improved corrosion
The copper acetate concentration was varied from 8,12,and 16 g l in the prepared electrolyte,and the electrolyte containing 16 g l of copper acetate was chosen for nickel copper deposition of the desired alloy composition (70:30.) By using this electrolyte (that contains 16 g l of copper acetate),further deposition was carried out atStudies on Electrodeposition of Copper from2011913&ensp&#0183&enspas an additive in CMS bath.Thus a formulation consisting of 25g l of copper as copper methane sulphonic acid,30 ml l of Free methane sulphonic acid,50ppm of chloride ion,32 ppm of Gelatin and CD 24 A dm2has very fine deposits compared to PEG as an additive.This is the optimum bath conditions to get bright deposits.
