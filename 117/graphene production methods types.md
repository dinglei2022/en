## GRAPHENE PRODUCTION USING CHEMICAL VAPOR …
graphene has been very difficult to produce,so its applications to society have been mainly theoretical in nature.The standard method is known as exfoliation,which produces very high quality graphene,but in very small amounts.Now with the development of graphene production throughThis Scientist Invented a Simple Way to Mass Produce GrapheneType keyword(s) to search.Today's Top Stories.The "exfoliated graphene method" first used to produce graphene in 2009 also created the highest quality graphene to date,at 200,000 cm^2 (V s.
