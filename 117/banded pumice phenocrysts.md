## Dacite Wikipedia
Porphyritic dacites contain blocky highly zoned plagioclase phenocrysts and or rounded corroded quartz phenocrysts.Subhedral hornblende and elongated biotite grains are present.Sanidine phenocrysts and augite (or enstatite) are found in some samples.The groundmass of these rocks is often aphanitic microcrystalline&nbspHattori mysite.science.uottawa.caThe occurrence of anhydrite in dacitic pumice has been reported by Knittel and others (1991),Bernard and others (1991),Pallister and others (1991,1992),and others.This study confirmed its common occurrence in gray and white pumice from Pinatubo.Banded pumice also contains anhydrite in both gray and white pumice layers.

Magma mixing can occur in a fluid manner to produce banded pumice or in a brittle manner to form enclaves.We propose that the critical control on mixing style is a competition between developing networks of crystals in the intruding magma that impart a strength.A model for mixing basaltic and dacitic magmas as deducedIt has been demonstrated experimentally that basaltic and dacitic magmas can be easily mixed to form both banded dacite and homogeneous andesite in less than a few hours.The presence of phenocrysts larger than 0.5 mm increased considerably the efficiency of mixing.
