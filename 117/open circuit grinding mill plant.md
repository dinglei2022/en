## Ball mill Wikipedia
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow&nbsp;.Basics in Minerals Processing Metso0.3 mm to 2 mm (8 Mesh 48 Mesh) in open circuit.One of the most common flow sheets for concentrating plants to wet grind 25 mm (1”) feeds (or finer) to desired product size.Rod mill discharge ab.1 mm (16 Mesh).Grinding mills Sizing.Even today this is more of an art than a science.Therefore it should be left to the.
