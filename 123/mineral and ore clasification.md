Classification of Mineral Deposits introduction hydrothermal deposits magmatic deposits,although we started out with a physically descriptive classification,we end up with a classification which also coincides with what we perceive to be unique genetic process,Magmatic deposits are syngenetic in that the ore minerals crystallize.Classifiion of Rocks and Minerals20191024&ensp&#0183&enspThe following are the various divisions under which rocks may be classified: IGNEOUS Rocks which have been subjected to heat.Volcanic (those that have been cooled at or near the surface) :— Trachyte (rough,greyish in colour,and light in weight).Basalt (blackish or brown,heavier and with fewer holes in it than trachyte).Phonolite,Andesite (of which porphyrite is an altered variety).

The Berzelian mineral classification system was named in honor of the Swedish chemist and mineralogist Jons Jakob Berzelius (1779 1848) The Berzelian system categorizes mineral species according to the main anion group present in their chemical structureEarth Science for Kids: Minerals DuckstersSome minerals have a different colored streak than the color of their body A gem is a piece of rare mineral such as diamond,emerald,or sapphire that is cut and polished to shine Certain minerals are needed by our bodies so we can grow healthy and strong Activities Take a ten question quiz about this page Earth Science Subjects

## Classifiion of ore deposits es.slideshare.net
Classifiion of ore deposits deposits through the last century has required and still requires the examination of great numbers and many types of mineral districts and the recording of their similarities and differences.Grouping together deposits with similar characteristics facilitates description,permits generalizations concerningClassification of Ore DepositsThe ore grade,or concentration of an ore mineral or metal,as well as its form of occurrence,will directly affect the costs associated with mining the ore The cost of extraction must thus be weighed against the metal value contained in the rock to determine what ore can be processed and what ore

## Mineral Classification of minerals Britannica
Mineral Classification of minerals: Since the middle of the 19th century,minerals have been classified on the basis of their chemical composition Under this scheme,they are divided into classes according to their dominant anion or anionic group (eg,halides,oxides,and sulfides) Several reasons justify use of this criterion as the distinguishing factor at the highest level of mineral.sifiion of Ore Deposits 			 					 							 			 Classifiion of Ore DepositsDeposits Produced by Mechanical Processes of Concentration

## Classification of Mineral Deposits Geology for Investors
Geologists,are known to have more opinions than economists,so it should come as no surprise that the classification of mineral deposits,is an on going hot topic The details will be debated until the sun cools,but the broad brush classification of mineral deposits is generally understood Most.
