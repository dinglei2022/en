## Papermaking Facts
Paper mills receive that pulp and make paper out of it.They do not bleach paper on the scale used in bleach plants,although they may add a bleach to the slurried pulp to prevent yellowing (usually in groundwood pulps) before sending it to the paper machine.If they want to make white paper,they generally use white pulp.Extracting Ores Mining Of Mineral Resources SiyavulaSome rocks are used as is,and do not need to be crushed into powder,or involved in minerals extraction.For example phosphate rock itself can be used as a fertiliser,or it can be used to make phosphoric acid.Sand,or the mineral silicon dioxide (SiO 2

## How copper is made
Most of the copper ores mined in the United States contain only about 1.2 1.6% copper by weight.The most common sulfide ore is chalcopyrite,CuFeS 2,also known as copper pyrite or yellow copper ore.Chalcocite,Cu 2 S,is another sulfide ore.Cuprite,or red copper ore,Cu 2 O,is an oxide ore.Stamp millStamp mills were used in early paper making for preparing the paper stuff,before the invention of the Hollander beater,and might have derived from those used in fulling wool.They were used in oil seed processing prior to pressing the oil from the milled seeds.Early mills were water powered but mills can also be steam or electric powered.
