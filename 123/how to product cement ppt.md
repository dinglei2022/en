## Cement Production an overview ScienceDirect Topics
G Habert,in Eco efficient Construction and Building Materials,2014 101 Introduction Cement production has undergone tremendous developments since its beginnings some 2,000 years ago While the use of cement in concrete has a very long history (Malinowsky,1991),the industrial production of cements started in the middle of the 19 th century,first with shaft kilns,which were later.CEMENTING cuPerlite Cement (Perlite + ordinary portland + bentonite) Perlite cements are prepared by adding perlite to ordinary portland Perlite is a light volcanic ore,when heated to fusion it gives rise to a very low density product (13 lb ft3) Bentonite is usually added to perlite cement slurries to disperse perlite more uniformly through the mixture
