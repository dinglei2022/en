## Synthesis of Nanomaterials by High Energy Ball Milling
For all nanocrystalline materials prepared by high energy ball milling synthesis route,surface and interface contamination is a major concern.In particular,mechanical attributed contamination by the milling tools (Fe or WC) as well as ambient gas (trace impurities such as O 2,N 2 in rare gases) can be problems for high energy ball milling.diagram of a ball mill circuitAG SAG mills can accomplish the same size reduction work as two or three stages of crushing and screening,a rod mill,and some or all of the work of a ball mill.Because of the range of mill sizes available,AG SAG milling can often be accomplished with fewer lines than in a conventional rod mill ball mi
