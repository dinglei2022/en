## the process of copper extracted
to extract copper from low grade ores (see below).The traditional method of extraction is to heat the copper sulfide.Copper(II) sulfide gives copper and sulfur dioxide during thermal decomposition.Thermal decomposition means that the compound breaks down into other substances when it is heated.Thermal decomposition is an endothermic reaction.Extraction from copper pyrites Homework HelpExtraction from copper pyrites: Extraction of copper from copper pyrites includes the steps shown below: 1.The copper pyrite is partially transformed into sulphides of copper and iron.2CuFeS 2 + O 2 → Cu 2 S + 2FeS + SO 2 2FeS + 3O 2 → 2FeO + 2SO 2 3.
