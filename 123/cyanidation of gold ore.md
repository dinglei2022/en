## Gold cyanidation Wikipedia
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low grade ore by converting the gold to a water soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction.Production of reagents for mineral processing to recover gold,copper,zinc and silver represents.Cyanide Chemistry International Cyanide Management Code.Although the affinity of cyanide for gold is such that it is extracted preferentially,cyanide will also form complexes with other metals from the ore,including copper,iron and zinc.The formation of strongly bound complexes such as those with iron and copper will tie up cyanide that would otherwise be available to dissolve gold.Copper cyanides are moderately stable; their formation can.
