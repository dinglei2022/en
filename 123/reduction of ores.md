Reduction of order,the method used in the previous example can be used to find second solutions to differential equations.However,this does require that we already have a solution and often finding that first solution is a very difficult task and often in the process of finding the first solution you will also get the second solution without needing to resort to reduction of order.Extraction of MetalsHigh temperature chemical reduction.1.Many metals are found as their oxides.2.Oxide Ores: Directly reduced (smelted) to the metal.General reducing agents:&nbsp;.
