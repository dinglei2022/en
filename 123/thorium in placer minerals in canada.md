Thorite is the most common thorium mineral.Thorium is a highly radioactive element and could be used as a replacement for uranium in nuclear power generation.It is estimated to be three times as common as uranium and all the thorium in the Earth's crust could have more potential energy than both uranium and the fossil fuel reserves combined.Division of Geology and Mineral Resources RadonThorium occurs in heavy mineral placer sands.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has assigned every U.S.county to one of three radon potential zones based on five factors: actual indoor radon measurements,aerial measurements of radioactivity,predominant geology,soil permeability,and typical foundation types.Most of the Commonwealth of Virginia falls into high to moderate potential.
