## Jaw Crusher Working Principle
The basic concept of the MMD Sizer is the use of two rotors with large teeth,on small diameter shafts,driven at a low speed by a direct high torque drive system.This design produces three major principles which all interact when breaking materials using Sizer Technology.The unique principles are: The Three Stage Breaking Action,TheGyratory Crushers Mineral Processing &amp MetallurgyGyratory Crushers.The primary rock breaker most commonly used in large plants is the gyratory crusher,of which a typical section is shown in Fig.5.It consists essentially of a gyrating crushing head (521) working inside a crushing bowl (522) which is fixed to the frame (501).
