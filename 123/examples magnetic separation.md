## Methods of Separation
Magnetic Separation; Let us discuss them in detail below.Handpicking.Handpicking process.This method involves simply picking out all the unwanted substances by hand and separating them from useful ones.The separated substances may be an impurity that has to throw away or maybe that both the separated substances are useful.For example.Magnetic Separation Examples In ChemistryMagnetic Separation Magnetic separation is a specialised method specifically used for separating magnetic materials such as iron from nonmagnetic materials such as soil and plastic It is commonly used in the mining and recycling industries An example of using magnetic separation in the laboratory.View Details Send Enquiry

## Electromagnetic Separation Mineral Processing &amp Metallurgy
Starting with a mixture of any of the above minerals it may be determined whether or not they can be separated by high tension,magnetic,or gravity methods and whether any one,or a combination of "Electromagnetic Separation" methods is required.If the minerals appear in different columns they may be separated by high tension and or magnetic methods alone.6 Separation of mixtures yellowreef2013527&ensp&#0183&ensp6 separation of mixtures 6 3 6.2 Magnetic attraction Magnetic attraction The method of magnetic attraction uses the basic principle of magnetism to separate a mixture of magnetic and nonmagnetic substances.Bringing a magnet near such a mixture allows the magnetic substances to be attracted to the magnet.
