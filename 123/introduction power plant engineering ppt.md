## Introduction to Power Plants Learn Mechanical Engineering
A power plant may be defined as a machine or assembly of equipment that generates and delivers a flow of mechanical or electrical energy The main equipment for the generation of electric power is generator When coupling it to a prime mover runs the generator,the electricity is generated The type of prime move determines,the type of power.Thermal Power Plant : Principle,Parts,Working,Sep 17,2017&#0183;&#32;A simple steam plant works on Rankine cycle In the first step,water is feed into a boiler at a very high pressure by BFP (boiler feed pump) This high pressurized water is heated into a boiler which converts it into high pressurized super heated steam This high energized steam passes through steam turbine (a mechanical device which converts flow energy of fluid into mechanical energy) and.
