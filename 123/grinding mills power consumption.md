## PROCESS CONTROL FOR CEMENT GRINDING IN VERTICAL
The power ingesting of a grinding process is 5060% in the cement production power consumption.The Vertical Roller Mill (VRM) reduces the power consumption for cement grinding approximately 3040% associated with other grinding mills.The process variables in cement grinding process using VRM are strongly nonlinear and having large timeVertical roller millVertical roller mill is a kind of grinding machine for cement raw material,cement clinker,slag and coal slag.It has the features of simple structure,low cost of manufacture and use.Vertical roller mill has many different forms,but it works basically the same.

## IsaMill Wikipedia
The IsaMill is a stirredmedium grinding mill,it was found that conventional grinding had a very high power consumption and that contamination of the mineral surface by iron from the steel grinding media adversely affected flotation performance.the power intensity of a ball mill is about 20 kW m 3.grinding mills power consumption kwScale Up in Sizing for Grinding Mills.Scaleup criterion is the net specific power consumption,i.e.the power consumed by the mill rotor itself minus all mechanical and electrical losses divided by the feed rate of solids.For the full scale mill,specific power is multiplied by the feed rate to get the net mill power.
