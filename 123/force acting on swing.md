a child riding on a swing rises to height 1.0m above the lowest point.another child of equal mass whose speed at the lowest point is twice as great will rise.so that there is effectively a 10n force action parallel to the floor in the diretion of motion and a 5n force acting perpendicular to the floor.the work done is.Physics on the Playground Scholastic20191030&ensp&#0183&enspKinetic energy is the middle part of the swinging,when the swing is approaching its peak on either side.Potential energy is the peak of the swinging on either side,when the swing is temporarily still.When the swing falls from either peak to the ground,the force of gravity is acting upon it.Slip Sliding Away: Friction Comparison.Materials

There are two forces acting on the simple pendulum.Gravity,of course,is a conservative force.The tension in the string,since it acts along the string itself and there is no movement of the pendulum in that direction,does no work so it doesForce acting on a seesaw?

I know that T net = Iα But my problem here is finding α,since α=a r could I substitute that in and say that T net = mr 2 (a r) = mar,and then just integrate as if I were finding the moment of inertia ( a∫r dm).I know this involves the density of the rod,but the example shown in the picture isn't all
