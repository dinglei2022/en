## Production of Expanded ClayAggregate for Lightweight
This technology allows production of expandedclay aggregate for lightweight concrete from nonselfbloating clays with predetermined properties: bulk weight within the range 160 850 kg m3 andFoam concrete Wikipedia20191021&ensp&#0183&enspFoam concrete is a versatile building material with a simple production method that is relatively inexpensive compared to autoclave aerated concrete.Foam concrete compounds utilising fly ash in the slurry mix is cheaper still,and has less environmental impact.
