## Aggregates in Concrete
Fine Aggregate (FA),Mass concrete may contain up to 150 mm ( 6 in) coarse aggregate Aggregates in Concrete Professor Kamran M Nemati Winter Quarter 2015 5 Concrete Technology Aggregates for Concrete,about 80% of aggregates; Natural sand and gravel) Limestone,sandstone Excellent to poor.Gradation of Fine Aggregate by Sieve AnalysisImportance: This experiment is carried out to find and check the gradation of the fine aggregate i.e.sand.The concrete consists of three basic solid materials,one is the sand whose fineness is checked by experiment no 1,the other two materials are the coarse aggregate that is the crush while the third is the fine aggregate that is the sand.

Fine aggregate concrete is used in highway and airfield construction because of the high tensile strength that results from its fine grained structure.The absence of coarse aggregate (crushed stone or gravel) substantially facilitates the preparation,transport,andFine aggregate and coarse aggregate definition,…Fine aggregate is natural sand which has been washed and sieved to remove particles larger than 5 mm and coarse aggregate is gravel which has been crushed,washed and sieved so that the particles vary from 5 up to 50 mm in size.The fine and coarse aggregate.
