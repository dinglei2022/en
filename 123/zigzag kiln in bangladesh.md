Bricks are the main building material in Bangladesh.Despite its importance,the technology employed by the industry continues to remain outdated,energyintensive and highly polluting.The vast majority,almost 95%,continue to use the Fixed Chimney technology which is a version of the Bulls Trench KilnBangladesh's Air Pollution Problem Grows,Brick by Brick201896&ensp&#0183&enspIn a 2017 interview with The Daily Star,Bangladesh's leading Englishlanguage newspaper,Raja Shankar,described as another kiln business representative,said that kiln conversion can cost from $96,000 for the simplest model to $6 million for the most advanced.

## Why highly polluting methods are used to manufacture
Brick kiln owners noted that,in contrast to fixed chimney kilns,few people in Bangladesh knew how to properly construct a fuel efficient zigzag kiln.They also noted that zigzag kilns require an electrically powered fan to draw the air through the longer flue gas pathway.ESMS: Bangladesh: Financing Brick Kiln Efficiency2014929&ensp&#0183&enspSubproject,as referred to in this document,is the conversion or upgrading of FCKs to zigzag kiln or any other more energyefficient technology,and the installation or construction of new more energyefficient technology such as hybrid Hoffman kiln (HHK),vertical shaft brick kiln (VSBK),and tunnel kiln.

Variation of manufacturing cost of brick largely depends on the brick kiln as well as the manufacturing process.The effect of CO2 emission from brick manufacturing factories and the CO2 emission reduction is now global issue,and minimizing its impact by precautionary and preventive measures is now a challenge for the world leaders.Clean Development Mechanism Project Opportunities in200752&ensp&#0183&enspThe other kiln that is slowly gaining popularity is the Hebla or Zigzag Kiln (Figure 3).It is rectangular in shape and measures 250 ft by 80 ft.It has a 55fthigh fixed chimney loed on one side of the kiln.There is a blower at the bottom of the chimney,which draws the flue gas from the kiln and discharges it into the atmosphere.
