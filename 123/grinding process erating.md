For this reason,the standard operating procedure is to keep the spindle speed at 3,500 rpm.If a new,25 0mmdiameter wheel is used,what spindle speed can be used before heat checking occurs? What spindle speed should be used to keep the same grinding temperatures as those encountered with the existing operating conditions? 26.44.ATEX directive Wikipedia20191021&ensp&#0183&enspThe ATEX directive consists of two EU directives describing what equipment and work space is allowed in an environment with an explosive atmosphere.ATEX derives its name from the French title of the 94 9 EC directive: Appareils destin&#233s &#224 &#234tre utilis&#233s en ATmosph&#232res EXplosivesDirectives&ensp&#0183&ensp
