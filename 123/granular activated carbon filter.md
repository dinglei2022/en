## How to use activated carbon in your aquarium!
For a wellmaintained aquarium,many fish keepers replace the activated carbon in their filter once each month.To ensure the activated carbon in your filter lasts as long as possible,it should be placed after your mechanical filter.If you install the activated carbon before the mechanical filter,it will soon become clogged by the larger debris.
