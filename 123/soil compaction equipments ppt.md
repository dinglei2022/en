## Factors affecting Compaction of Soil Types of soil
Compaction of the soil is the process where the dry density of soil is increased by reducing air content or air voids present in the soil.This process is an essential part of the construction of any structure,as it strengthens the soil.Many factors influence the degree with which the soil is compactedSoil Compaction Testing Equipment PCTESoil Compaction Testing Equipment Proctor Compaction Moulds and Compaction Hammers Moulds and rammers are used to determine the connection between the density and moisture content of compacted soil
