## Pulverized coalfired boiler Wikipedia
20191023&ensp&#0183&enspA pulverized coalfired boiler is an industrial or utility boiler that generates thermal energy by burning pulverized coal (also known as powdered coal or coal dust since it is as fine as face powder in cosmetic makeup) that is blown into the firebox.The basic idea of a firing system using pulverised fuel is to use the whole volume of the furnace for the combustion of solid fuels.Mapped: The world’s coal power plants in 2020Plants burning low quality lignite can emit as much as 1,200 tonnes of CO2 per gigawatt hour (GWh) of electricity generated,falling below 1,000tCO2 GWh for harder,less polluting grades from sub bituminous through to bituminous coal.
