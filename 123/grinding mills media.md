## MEDIA MILLING FOR CHEMICAL APPLICATIONS
There are many different types of media mills,some grinding equipment,such as ball mills,are more suitable for coarse materials.These mills use “large” media ranging in size from 20mm and up to produce material about ten microns to mesh sizes.Other mills,such as Attritors,are more appropriate for “mid range” size particles.IsaMillNatural media is suitable for ˜ne grinding but ceramics are normally needed for coarse grinding.Ceramic media is more ef˜cient than natural media meaning lower installed power,lower media consumption and fewer mills for a speci˜c application.The best media type for an application is a questi
