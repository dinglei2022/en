20191017&ensp&#0183&enspThree of the processes introduced above have made great strides in solving these problems for the extraction of copper from chalcopyrite: The GEOCOAT™ Process A heap leaching process that is capable of bioleaching copper concentrates.It does this by coating the concentrate slurry onto a support rock,or substrate material,and stacking this coated material in a bioxidation heap.The Mining Process Waihi GoldFollowing this leaching process the slurry passes through six adsorption tanks containing carbon granules which adsorb the gold and silver.This process removes 93% of the gold and 70% of the silver.See more detail on leaching and adsorption.6.Elution and electrowinning The loaded carbon is fed into an elution column where the bullion is

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper …
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.
