## Laterally loaded helical piles in sand ScienceDirect
A series of tests were carried out on vertical pile with one helix at varying depth,h,although it is not practical to use helical pile without attaching a helix at the tip of the pile.In order to study the helical depth ratio effect,h L,the depth ratio was changed to give three different values of 1.0,0.67,and 0.5.The pile length is 0.6 m,while the diameter is 20 mm embedded in sand.What is screw case depth AnswersScrew case depth is the depth at which the outer hardness of the screw is defined to.Typically tapping screws have a inner core hardness that is 'softer' than the threads,as the treads are
