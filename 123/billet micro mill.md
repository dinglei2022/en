## Steel mill
A steel mill or steelworks is an industrial plant for the manufacture of steel.It may be an integrated steel works carrying out all steps of steelmaking from smelting iron ore to rolled product,but may also describe plants where steel semi finished casting products (blooms,ingots,slabs,billets) are made,from molten pig iron or from scrap.Micromilling Treatment TypesMicromilling.What? Micro milling is the removal of a small thickness (1 inch or less) of existing asphalt concrete prior to placing a surface treatment.The difference between cold milling and micro milling is the texture left on the existing pavement.Micro milling provides for a smoother surface than cold milling and is typically used before.
