## Sodium Hydroxid Chemical for the Increase of pHvalue
20191021&ensp&#0183&enspSodium hydroxide is a chemical agent for the increase of pHvalues.It is used in the electrophoretic coating process AntitarnishA100 PROKIT to adjust the pHvalue to 3.7 (range: 3.4 4.1).Appliion.Use only diluted sodium hydroxide when applying the electrophoretic coating process.Sodium cyanide Wikipedia2019107&ensp&#0183&enspSodium cyanide is an inorganic compound with the formula Na C N.It is a white,watersoluble solid.Cyanide has a high affinity for metals,which leads to the high toxicity of this salt.Its main appliion,in gold mining,also exploits its high reactivity toward metals.It is a moderately strong base.When treated with acid,it forms the toxic gas hydrogen cyanide:
