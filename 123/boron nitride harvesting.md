2019101&ensp&#0183&enspHexagonal boron nitride.Monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN),also known as 'white graphene',is structurally similar to graphite and features a honeycomb arrangement with alternating boron and nitrogen atoms in place of carbon.hBN has a higher energy gap (5.97 eV) than graphene,thus functions as an insulator instead of a semimetal.However,it can also function as aAtomic‐Scale Mott Schottky Heterojunctions of BoronThe atomic ratios of boron and nitrogen element are nearly 1:1 for all h‐BN‐C G‐x samples (Table S1,Supporting Information) with slightly more B atoms.Typical FTIR signal of cubic carbon nitride centered around 1200 cm −1 was not observed for all h‐BN‐C G‐x samples.
