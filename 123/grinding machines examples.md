## 8 Principles of Centerless Grinding
A downside of centerless grinding is you can’t have as many multiple axes operating on the workpieces.However,there are many parts where the process addresses the limitations of machining in terms of dimensions,materials,and surface finishes.That’s why we like to say that where machining ends,the centerless grinding process begins.Grinding and Polishing24&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;automatic machines usually yield better quality,faster,more reproducible results.Manual grinding allows better control of grinding depth than au tomatic grinding,which could be important when the cross section at a speciﬁc depth is of interest.Automatic equipment is much more expensive than manual machines.
