## Which Materials are the Best Conductors? Yahoo,
Dec 29,2007&#0183;&#32;The best conductors are gold,silver,copper,and aluminum in that order,though it does depend on whether you're comparing on a volume,weight,or molar basis Generally speaking,any metal will be a good conductor for your experiment and any non metal will be an insulatorWhat are the materials of good conductors? Quora1 gold,best but expensive,many pins or contacts in computers are gold plated 2 silver,not as good as gold,it still expensive 3 copper,gives us the best conductivity for the cost

## Best Conductor Material for Electrical Cables
Home Technical Articles What would be the best conductor material for electrical wires and cables Al or Cu conductor,The conductivity of copper is 65% higher than that of aluminium which means that the conductor size of similarly rated cables is proportionately smallerConductors Examples SoftschoolsA conductor is any piece of material that easily allows heat or electricity to pass through it Many different materials can be conductors but metals are the best conducting materials that are available to us A conductor allows electrons to flow freely across its surface Examples of Conductors: 1.

## Physics for Kids: Electrical Conductors and Insulators
Electrical conductors allow electric current to flow easily because of the make up of their atoms In a conductor,the outer electrons of the atom are loosely bound and can freely move through the material when an electric charge is applied In general,the best electrical conductors are metals.
