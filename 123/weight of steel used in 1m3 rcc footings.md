## Calculate cement sand aggregate for concrete Nominal Mix
*As I have explained above,while calculating M7.5 and M5 grade concrete,total dry material required for concrete is taken as 1.52 instead of 1.55 and quantity of sand and aggregate is adjusted for M10 and M5 based on experience.How To Calculate Steel Quantity From Drawing the Easy Way,Such as footing,column,beam,slab,and lintel sunshade,etc So,I’ll discuss how to calculate steel quantity for these structural parts of a building from drawing How To Calculate Steel Quantity For Footing From Drawings? You’ll have a structural drawings for footing which will be as image below

## Reinforced concrete Wikipedia
Reinforced concrete (RC) (also called reinforced cement concrete or RCC) is a composite material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility The reinforcement is usually,though not necessarily,steel reinforcing bars and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the.Reinforcement Estimates YourSpreadsheetsReinforcement Estimates Typical average weight of reinforcement (kg m3) in concrete building elements The below figures are for guideline only and may vary for different projects
