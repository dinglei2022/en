## Longterm properties of concrete containing limestone powder
The strength and resistance to chloride penetration of the concrete containing limestone powder increase much less than those of plain cement concrete at late ages.When the replacement ratio of limestone powder exceeds 10%,the resistance to carbonation of concrete decreases significantly,but the drying shrinkage of concrete is reduced.The effect of limestone powder,ﬂy ash and silica fume ongraded skeleton of powder is reported to reduce the required powder volume to ensure adequate deformability for concrete (Fujiwara et al 1996).Chemical factors include the effect of limestone ﬁller in supplying ions into the phase solution,thus modifying the kinetics of hydration and the morphology of hydration products (Daimon &amp Sakai 1998).
