## classes of concrete
classes of concrete.by philemon (Nairobi Kenya) When going through building plans I encounter construction jargon where I am instructed to cast class 25,20 or 30 of concrete.What are these classes and how do I determine them where not given?26 Different Types of Concrete; [Its Classification,Uses.31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The typical concrete with normal water cement ratio always has micro pores,which limits the strength of regular concrete.Silica fumes consist of very fine particles (actually,6 times finer than of cement particles).Hence,if it is added to the concrete mix,the minute pore spaces can be reduced,resulting in high strength concrete.
