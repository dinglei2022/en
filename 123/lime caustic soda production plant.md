## Soda Ash Graymont
Lime in the production of soda ash Lime plays two important roles in the production of soda ash and sodium hydroxide One of the major sources of soda ash (Na 2 CO 3 ) and caustic soda (NaOH) in North America involves the refining of naturally occurring trona orManufacture Of Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) From Lime (CaO)Sodium hydroxide (NaOH),also known as caustic soda and belonging to the alkaline earth group,is a base metal caustic.NaOH is used in many industries,primarily as a strong base in the manufacture of pulp and paper,textiles,drinking water,soaps and detergents and as a dirt cleaner produced worldwide in 1998 is about 45,000,000 tons.
