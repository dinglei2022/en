2019117&ensp&#0183&enspFineness modulus is generally used to get an idea of how coarse or fine the aggregate is.More fineness modulus value indies that the aggregate is coarser and small value of fineness modulus indies that the aggregate is finer.Fineness modulus of different type of sand is as per given below.mix UW Courses Web Servervolume of coarse aggregate Concrete Technology 10 Bulk Volume of Coarse Aggregate Once the MSA and FM of sand are determined,these values can be used to determine bulk volume of coarse aggregate (CA) per unit volume

20171029&ensp&#0183&enspTo find fineness modulus of coarse aggregate we need sieve sizes of 75mm,37.5mm,19mm,9.5mm,4.75mm,2.36mm,1.18mm,0.6mm,0.3mm and 0.15mm.Fineness modulus is the number at which the average size of particle is known when we counted from lower order sieve size to higher order sieve.So,in the calculation ofAggregates for Concrete,Chapter 5 Civil Engineering,FM of fine aggregate is useful in estimating proportions of fine and coarse aggregates in concrete mixtur An example of how the FM of a fine aggregate is determined (with an assumed sieve analysis) is shown in Table 5 4
