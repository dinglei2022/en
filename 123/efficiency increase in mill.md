## Steam turbine Wikipedia
A steam turbine is a device that extracts thermal energy from pressurized steam and uses it to do mechanical work on a rotating output shaft.Its modern manifestation was invented by Charles Parsons in 1884.The steam turbine is a form of heat engine that derives much of its improvement in thermodynamic efficiency from the use of multiple stages in the expansion of the steam,whichEfficiency of Wind Energy LoveToKnowWind efficiency is the amount of kinetic energy in the wind that is converted to mechanical energy and electricity.Laws of physics described by Betz Limit says the maximum theoretical limit is 59.6%.The wind requires the rest of the energy to blow past the blades.
