## Cement hydration
Three principal reactions occur: Almost immediately on adding water some of the clinker sulphates and gypsum dissolve producing an alkaline,sulfate rich,solution.Soon after mixing,the (C 3 A) phase (the most reactive of the four main clinker minerals) reacts with the water to form an aluminate rich gel (Stage I on the heat evolution curve above).).The gel reacts with sulfate in solution.Clinker type I,II,V,and Low Alkali.Ordinary Portland Cement Clinker is the core component in producing cement which is formed by sintering limestone.In the manufacturing of Portland cement,clinker formed by sintering or fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction,alumina silicate materials such as clay and limestone during the cement kiln stage and happens as 3 millimeters (0.12 in) to 25 millimeters (0.98.

## The Bogue calculation of cement mineral composition A.
The Bogue calculation of cement mineral composition A simple estimate of the phase composition of a portland cement can be obtained from the oxide composition if one assumes that the four main cement minerals occur in their pure form.With this assumption,all of the Fe 2 O 3 is assigned to C 4 AF and the remaining Al 2 O 3 is assigned to C 3 A.Cement CompositionCalculation of compound composition of cement Bogue formulations are used to determine the compound compositions of PC containing no secondary materials (and having A F ≥ 0.64).These compound compositions may be calculated from the oxide analysis as follows (C,S,A,F,and S denote the % of CaO,SiO 2,Al 2 O 3,Fe 2 O 3,and SO 3.
