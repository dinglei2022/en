## Construction and Building Materials
Gardner [15] studied the pressure of fresh concrete in an instrumented steel formwork with 4.6 m high,0.91 m wide and either 27.9 cm,29.2 cm or 53.3 cm between faces,constructed as rigid as possible.The lateral pressure was measured by means of ?veConcrete Mix Design Procedure and Example IS456201668&ensp&#0183&enspConcrete mix design is the process of finding the proportions of concrete mix in terms of ratios of cement,sand and coarse aggregates.For e.g.a concrete mix of proportions 1:2:4 means that cement,fine and coarse aggregate are in the ratio 1:2:4 or the mix contains one part of cement,two parts of fine aggregate and four parts of coarse aggregate.
