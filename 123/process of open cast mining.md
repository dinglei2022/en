## Open Pit Mining Pros & Cons Synonym
Open pit mining or strip mining is an extraction process for ore or fossil fuels that takes place at the surface of a mining site.Worldwide,40 percent of mining occurs at the surface,according to Greenpeace International.Open Cast Mining Advantages 911metallurgist2019111&ensp&#0183&enspIn the previous topic,we saw which are some of the advantages that can make the surface open pit mining methods superior method compared to the underground mining.However,underground mining has its own advantages.And finally,the ultimate decision to mine from the surface or from underground comes down to the specific characteristics of the deposit.
