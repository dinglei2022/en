## Ball Mills
Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1 4 inch and finer,down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns.To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills,they must be operated in a closed system,with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced.Ball Mill an overview ScienceDirect TopicsBall mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore.The balls are initially 5 10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds.The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.% ore and 25% steel.The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particlesize measurement device and sizecontrol cyclones.
