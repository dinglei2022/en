## Energy Efficiency and Saving in the Cement Industry,
Yet another way to reduce energy and process emissions in cement production is to blend cements with increased proportions of alternative (non clinker) feedstocks,such as volcanic ash,granulated blast furnace slag from iron production,or fly ash from coal fired power generationUS6033467A Method of making cement or mine backfillA method of making cement from base metal smelter slag produced by nickel,copper,lead or zinc smelter,includes grinding the slag with clinker and blast furnace slag to a size in the range of from about 250 to about 425 mesh to produce ground slag cement,and mixing the ground slag cement with Portland cement in a ratio of at least about 0.5:1 by weight to produce a blended cement.
