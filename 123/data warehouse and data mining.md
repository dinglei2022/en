## Data warehouse Wikipedia
In computing,a data warehouse (DW or DWH),also known as an enterprise data warehouse (EDW),is a system used for reporting and data analysis,and is considered a core component of business intelligence.DWs are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources.Introduction to Data Warehousing: Definition,Concept,andData Warehousing (DW) represents a repository of corporate information and data derived from operational systems and external data sources.Introduction to data warehousing and data mining as covered in the discussion will throw insights on their interrelation as well as areas of demarion.
