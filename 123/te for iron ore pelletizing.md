Within the MHA binder water iron ore system in pellets,the pH value has an important effect on the adsorption behavior of MHA binder,and also on the pelletizing process.In such MHA binder water iron ore suspension system,there should be many different kinds of metal cations dissolving from the surface of iron ore particles.Temperaturerising characteristic of chromiteThe microwave heating technique can avoid the nonhomogeneous phenomenon of transferring heat and mass in pulverous ore materials by conventional heating.The temperaturerising characteristic of chromite ore fines containing coal in a microwave field was
