## Line extraction SOLANCIS
Line mining is done out in the open.Once studies show the existence of stone at the site,the extraction is made by separating the rock in quarry benches and dividing it into blocks.If the site presents the desired conditions for quarrying,the next step is the licensing,a procedure which entails various environmental requisites.
