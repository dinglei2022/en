Gold can be extracted from mercury,but mercury cannot be transmuted into gold.Sheldon and Estey also commented: The suggested explanation of a change of the number of electrons in the nucleus changing mercury to gold seems good in theory,but incredible in fact,for the potential drop per mean free path of a Hg molecule is only about 0.1 volt.Travels with Mercury II: Using Mercury in Small Scale Gold.The tedious and inefficient process of panning gold without the help of the mercury would undoubtedly take hours more time and yield much less gold.In this area,the gold yield when using mercury is only about 3 to 5 grams per day; the miners can ill afford to work all day for less than that.
