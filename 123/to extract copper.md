## New approaches for extracting and recovering metals from mine.
15 May 2017.A two stage mineral leaching and metal recovery protocol was developed to extract copper from tailings generated as waste materials in two mines currently operating in Spain and Serbia.The most effective extraction of copper (84 to &gt;90%) was achieved by bioleaching the tailings at 45 °C,using a&nbsp;.Bioleaching and Phytomining Extraction of Copper by.Extraction of Copper from Ores Phytoming and Bioleaching Phytomining How It works This is one way of extracting copper from low grade ores which are less than 1% copper.
