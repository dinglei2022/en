## Ore Blending Metallurgist &amp Mineral Processing Engineer
20191026&ensp&#0183&enspI worked on a variability program for conceptual design of a Cu Mo porphyry that involved 150 variability samples (batchtests,40% only rougher,60% rougher &amp cleaners).The variability samples were chosen so that the ore grade proportions in the 150 samples matched the histogram of the grade proportions of the orebody.Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Facility Design201594&ensp&#0183&enspThe first phase was to design the facility and determine the long lead time equipment requirements such that it would be able to handle projected demand 10 years out into the future.The second phase,at a more detailed level,was to determine the best ways to run the plant in order to optimize throughput.
