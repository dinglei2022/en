## Erosion &amp Sedimentation Kiama Municipal Council
Erosion,caused by either wind or water,is common in areas that have been cleared of vegetation,are on steep slopes,or are close to waterways.Soil erosion by water also causes the additional problem of sedimentation of waterways,as soils are washed into creeks and stormwater drains during rain.Wind erosion is of particular concern withinEffects of Soil Erosion on Biodiversity GreentumbleNegative impacts on aquatic ecosystems and species.Soil erosion can lead to the soil running off into waterways,which increases the sedimentation of the water,and makes aquatic ecosystems inhospitable for those organisms that require clearer waters for their habitat.
