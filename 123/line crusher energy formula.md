## Rock Crushing Theory and Formula using Kick &amp; Rittinger's Law
Rittinger’s theory and law of the energy expended in crushing of rock is that the work of crushing is proportional to the reduction in diameter; or,as I have more fully expressed it: “The work done in crushing is proportional to the surface exposed by the operation; or,better expressed for this purpose,theEnergy consumption calculator kWh calculatorEnergy consumption calculator.kWh calculator.Energy consumption calculation.The energy E in kilowatt hours (kWh) per day is equal to the power P in watts (W) times number of usage hours per day t divided by 1000 watts per kilowatt:

## Energy,Wavelength and Electron Transitions
This transition to the 2nd energy level is now referred to as the &quot;Balmer Series&quot; of electron transitions.Johan Rydberg use Balmers work to derived an equation for all electron transitions in a hydrogen atom.Here is the equation: R= Rydberg Constant 1.0974x10 7 m 1; λ is the wavelength; n is equal to the energy level (initial and final)
