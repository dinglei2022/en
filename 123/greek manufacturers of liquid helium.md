## Helium II Defined Cryogenic Society of America
Helium II occurs once the temperature of the liquid helium drops below 217K The phase transition between the first liquid phase of Helium (referred to as Helium I) and Helium II is a second order phase transition,which in practical terms means that there is no latent heat required for the transition
