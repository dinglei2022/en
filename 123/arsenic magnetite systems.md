## Arsenic remediation through magnetite based in situ,
Magnetite is stable under most redox conditions in aquifers,and able to co precipitate and adsorb arsenic Here,we present results from microcosm and column experiments using sediments and groundwater from US Superfund sites,and from reactive transport modellingThe effect of nanocrystalline magnetite size on arsenic,improved materials and systems are needed [3]Inparticular,sorbents must be able to achieve a low As level in drinking water for geographical areas with high As concentrations Many papers have been published demonstrating that bulk iron oxides have a high afﬁnity for the adsorption of arsenite and arsenate [1,4,5]
