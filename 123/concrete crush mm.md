## Strength and stiffness of compacted crushed concrete,
The strength and stiffness of CCA with a maximum particle size D max =375 mm obtained from a typical concrete crushing plant are noticeably lower than CCA sieved to D max =19 mm compacted using the same energy However,when compacted to the same dry density,the original CCA exhibits the strength and stiffness higher than the sieved CCAAggregate Material Modern ConcreteAggregates used in creating concrete can account up to 75 percent of the total volume used and these materials are divided into two distinct categories: fine and coarse siz Fine aggregates generally consist of natural sand or crushed stone with particles sizes of 3 8 inch (95 mm)
