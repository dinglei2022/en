## Molybdenum Alloys an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The cobalt nickel chromium molybdenum alloy (MP35N) can be cast or forged.The mechanical properties of both alloys are almost the same as those of the cast cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy,but the former is inferior to the latter in wear resistance and corrosion resistance.The alloy has a high workability as the 316L stainless steel.Molybdenum Alloy Supplier Sheet,Plate,Wire,Tubes,Rods20191022&ensp&#0183&enspMolybdenum Alloy Facts.Molybdenum's prime alloy is TZM.This alloy contains 99.2% min.to 99.5% max.of Mo,0.50% Ti and 0.08% Zr with a trace of C for carbide formations.TZM offers twice the strength of pure moly at temperatures over 1300&#176C.
