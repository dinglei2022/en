## Understanding the effects of goethitic iron ore Process productivity
19 Apr 2017.As demonstrated on the plot below,where the balance of ore textural components is shifting to the right with time from hematite dominated (blue,red) to goethitic (brown,yellow),rising proportions of these ore types are resulting in increasingly goethitic iron ore products.This has had a noticeable impact on&nbsp;.Iron Production Chemistry LibreTexts7 Dec 2014.This is accomplished by the method of pyrometallurgy,a high temperature process.The high temperatures are needed for the reduction of.On a side note,Hematite gets its name from the Greek word meaning blood like because of the color of one form of its powder.The Ancient Greeks believed that large&nbsp;.
