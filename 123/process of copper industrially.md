## How copper is made material,used,processing,steps
Process The process of extracting copper from copper ore varies according to the type of ore and the desired purity of the final product.Each process consists of several steps in which unwanted materials are physically or chemically removed,and the concentration of copper is progressively increased.The Extraction of Copper Chemistry LibreTextsThe Process.The concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica) and air or oxygen in a furnace or series of furnaces.The copper(II) ions in the chalcopyrite are reduced to copper(I) sulfide (which is reduced further to copper metal in the final stage).
