## Mechanisms of Grinding Modifiion by Chemical
200424&ensp&#0183&ensp[2].Based on the results of a research program studying the effect of fluidity modifiers on the performance of batch and industrial grinding mills,other workers [3 13] have adopted a third mechanism.The proposed mechanism has emerged from correlation of the grinding results with the rheological behavior of slurries of similar solid content.Elucidating Grinding Mechanism by Theoretical and20171231&ensp&#0183&enspGrinding is one of the essential manufacturing processes for producing brittle or hard materialsbased precision parts (e.g.optical lenses).In grinding,a grinding wheel removes the desired amount of material by passing the same area on the workpiece surface multiple times.How the topography of a workpiece surface evolves with these passes is thus an important research issue,
