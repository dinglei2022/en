## Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum Grinding
20191024&ensp&#0183&enspIn Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize "just in case".Well,this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and tear.ball mill performance calculation hikeafricaBall mil design calculation? Yahoo Answers.Mar 31,2008 &#183 Best Answer: A ball mill is a horizontal cylinder partly filled with steel balls (or occasionally other shapes) that rotates on its axis,imparting a tumbling and cascading action to the balls.Material fed through the mill is crushed by impact and ground by attrition between the balls.
