## Frequently Asked Questions
Frequently Asked Questions.For the majority of slow and medium speed drives,the total mid span movement in the slack span of the chain should be approximately 6% of the drive’s center distance.For drives operating at high speeds,impulse,or reversing loads,the total mid span movement should be reduced to 3% of the center.Wind Turbine Speed TurbineGeneratorThe start up speed is the minimum wind speed needed for the rotor and the blades to begin spinning,this low rotational speed will not provide any usable electric power.The more important,cut in speed,is the wind speed at which the turbine generator will begin to produce electricity.This is a crucial piece of information to understand about.

As a general rule of thumb,HID grow lights like Metal Halide (MH) and High Pressure Sodium (HPS) are most suitable for relatively larger grows where there is at least 5 feet (1.5 meters) of height in the grow space,though it’s recommended to use a taller space for the best results.Th5.FANS AND BLOWERSdesign,radial fans are well suited for high temperatures and medium blade tip speeds.Forward curved fans are used in clean environments and operate at lower temperatures.They are well suited for low tip speed and high airflow work they are
