## Calcite Wikipedia
Calcite is a carbonate mineral and the most stable polymorph of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) The Mohs scale of mineral hardness,based on scratch hardness comparison,defines value 3 as "calcite" Other polymorphs of calcium carbonate are the minerals aragonite and vateriteLapis Lazuli Quality FactorsLapis Lazuli Quality Factors The even,deep blue color of this lapis lazuli cabochon is rare and highly prized by connoisseurs,In its most prized form,lapis lazuli has no visible calcite,although it might contain gold colored pyrite flecks If the flecks are small and sprinkled attractively throughout the gem,their presence doesn’t.
