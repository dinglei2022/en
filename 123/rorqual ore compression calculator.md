To mine,one simply harvests the ore that floats in asteroid belts found throughout EVE Online.Because of its simplicity and ease of entry,many new players are attracted to the activity.This is a guide to the most basic processes of mining,intended to familiarize very new players to the structure of the mining industry in EVE Online.Rorqual test #1: 8,794 m3 of ore per minute : EveYield: I pulled in about 79,000 m3 of ore in 9 minutes,or ~8,794 m3 per minute.This was in a sparse belt with rocks popping relatively quickly.Theoretical max yield per the dev blog is around 18,400 m3 per minute,but that doesn't factor in drone flight time,asteroids popping early,or less than optimal fit skills (One obvious point: I doubt we will see many T2 drone mining rigs used).
