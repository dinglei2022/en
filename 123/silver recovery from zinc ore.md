## FR2556370A1 Process for the recovery of silver
the invention concerns the recovery of silver from ore residues.&lt p&gt it relates to a process under which,during the leaching operation of zinc sulfide minerals,chemical zinc sulfide is added to ensure that silver salts preferentially fix with this zinc sulfide.this is then separated by flotation of the zinc pulse residue.in this way,the floating chest is rich in silver that can beMineralogy and silver distribution in argentiferous20161227&ensp&#0183&enspVery low silver recovery resulted from the asreceived samples because of a high encapsulation level of the silver minerals in the manganese oxides and Fe 2 O 3.Silver recovery significantly improved through fine grinding of the ore samples and dissolution of the manganese oxides from the samples.
