## Sintering an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Abstract.Sintering is the most economic and widely used agglomeration process to prepare iron ore fines for blast furnace use.In this chapter,the sintering process is first described and the key steps of the sintering process,namely,granulation and thermal densification,are identified.Discussion is then focused on the effect of the chemical,physical,and mineralogical characteristics.Iron ore sintering with charcoal tandfonline2018612&ensp&#0183&enspIron ore sintering with charcoal R.Lovel *1,K.Vining 2 and M.Dell Amico 3 The iron blast furnace is the most widely used and efficient producer of liquid iron however,emissions from sintering and coking cause environmental pressure for the integrated steel works.
