## Aluminum29 Isotope CHEMISTRY Help? Yahoo Answers
Nov 16,2011&nbsp&#0183&#32Aluminum29 Isotope CHEMISTRY Help? The mass number of Aluminum 29 is 29.Since the atomic number is the number of protons,and the total is the number of protons and neutrons,all you have to do to figure out the number of neutrons is subtract the number of protons from the total mass.So 29 minus 13 equals 16.Status: ResolvedIf aluminum has an atomic number of 13 how many protons,Thirteen The atomic number is always equal to the number of protons in a single atom of that element
