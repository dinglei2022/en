## Compressive Strength of Concrete &amp Concrete Cubes What
Compressive Strength.The compressive strength of any material is defined as the resistance to failure under the action of compressive forces.Especially for concrete,compressive strength is an important parameter to determine the performance of the material during service conditions.Strength of casing and tubing  PetroWikiYp = minimum yield strength,psi,internal pressure resistance is inherently conservative.
