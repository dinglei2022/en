## How To Calculate A Compaction Test Report
2 &ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This is a continuation of the previous article I posted How to do a compaction test or In situ density test,about the calculation of the compaction test report.Here we are going to compute the bulk density of sand down to the degree of compaction of soil.I would really want to pursue this article just to completely show the full process of getting the results of the test from taking the.Concrete Testing Equipment ELE InternationalConcrete cores can be taken from hardened concrete for testing,but Non destructive Test (NDT) equipment enables the testing of in situ concrete or concrete samples.ELE provides crack detection microscopes,and a (Schmidt) rebound hammer,or test hammer,for measuring surface hardness and penetration resistance.
