## Tantalum Mining,Surface Mining,Underground Mining,…
Tantalum is produced as a byproduct by the tin industry from smelting cassiterite ore concentrates for processing.The biggest tantalum mine is the Mibra mine in Nazareno,Brazil.The Extraction and refining of tantalum is done by treating the ores with a mixture of hydrofluoric and sulfuric acids at elevated temperatures,because of which tantalum and niobium tend to dissolve along with.TANTALUM,TIN AND TUNGSTENAs tantalum,tin and tungsten deposits are generally hard rock,and low grade (particularly tantalum),they are considerably more difficult to process than mineral sands.Mining is either open cut or underground and requires drilling and blasting.
