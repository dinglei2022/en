## Using blinding as struts in cut and cover excavations
This proposal stems from Powderham's pioneering work at Mott MacDonald,which shows that blinding struts can eliminate the need for temporary steel propping in cut and cover excavations.Mott MacDonald has used blinding struts in the construction of the Channel Tunnel cut and cover works,the Limehouse Link and the Heathrow Express cofferdam.Labor Requirement for Various Construction Works2016222&ensp&#0183&enspThe cost of construction project highly depends on the requirements of labor for various activities during construction.There are direct and indirect costs associated with the labor.They are the salary of labors,their accommodation,food,insurance cost etc.Thus it is essential to understand the
