## Raw materials Understanding Cement
Technically,a cement producer can have almost complete control over clinker composition by blending raw materials of different compositions to produce the desired result.In practice,however,clinker composition is largely determined by the compositions of the locallyavailable raw materials which make up the bulk of the raw meal.Cement Chemistry and Additives2019411&ensp&#0183&enspcoalfired power stations.These materials are pu verized into fine powder,combined to obtain a g.ven bulk oxide composition and fed into a rotating kiln.Heated as high as 1,5000C 12,7300Fl,the raw materials undergo a complex series of chemical reactions to produce the four main compounds that make up cement: tricalci
