The Three Roll Mill is also the most versatile dispersing system in use today and,because of its process related benefits,is often the only solution when specific results need to be achieved When dispersing,premixed suspensions are processed between rollers turning at different speedsRoller Mill Maintenance00 CPM2015113&ensp&#0183&enspbetween the roll ends and the bearings to keep the rolls from shifting.A more progressive solution is to replace the straight bore bearings with new bearings using a tapered sleeve adapter to absolutely clamp the bearing to the roll shaft and prevent any such movement.
