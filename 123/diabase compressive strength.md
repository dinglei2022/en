The strongest rock in the world in compression is Diabase,which can stand up to 350 MPa Diabase is a kind of fine grained igneous rock Close behind diabase in compressive strength come other fine grained igneous rocks like Diorite,Estimation of Cambridge Argillite Strength Based onResults from unconfined compressive strength testing,splitting tensile strength testing (using the Brazilian test),and the point load test method were compared to the recorded drilling parameters and calculated compound parameters such as the Somerton Index and the Drilling Energy.
