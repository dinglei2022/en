Placing and compacting 6 Once at the site,the concrete must be placed and compacted.These two operations are performed almost simultaneously.Placing must be done so that segregation of the various ingredients is avoided and full compaction—with all air bubbles eliminated—can be achieved.Mixing and Transporting ConcreteThe successful placement of concrete is dependent upon careful mixing,the proper.are required for the production of a homogeneous concrete&quot; (Young,267).Transporting the concrete mix is defined as the transferring of concrete from.
