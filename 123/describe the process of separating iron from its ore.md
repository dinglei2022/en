## Extraction Process of Aluminium from Bauxite Ore
2019111&ensp&#0183&enspIt is essential that the Al2O3 (alumina) be obtained substantially free from these impurities as otherwise the iron oxide and silica would be reduced and contaminate the metallic aluminum produced in the Hall (or Heroult) Process.The separation of the alumina from the impurities in the bauxite ore is usually accomplished by the Bayer Process.Ways to Separate Metal From Ore SciencingThe process of separating a metal from its ore is known as smelting.Smelting is widely practiced today and has a long history dating back to the Bronze Age,when ancient peoples first learned the technique.Smelting methods range from the basic to the hightech,and are applied to a variety of materials,including aluminum,iron and copper.
