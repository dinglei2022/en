Problems in production 1.1 production process problems (1) the secondary air temperature kiln hood) is too low (950 ℃).2) clinker grate cooler temperature is too high (200 ~ 300 ℃).3) the fine material side &quotred river&quot continues to the crusher,and the grate plate and guard plate burn frequently.CHAPTER 3.0 CEMENT MANUFACTURING PROCESSprocess within the preheater and the kiln is called calcination and the product so formed is called clinker.The clinker is dark green in colour and for the best fit clinker it should contain 30% nodules of the total output.The clinker is then discharged in the Grate cooler for cooling.Some part of

## How Cement Is Made
The heated air from the coolers is returned to the kilns,a process that saves fuel and increases burning efficiency.After the clinker is cooled,cement plants grind it and mix it with small amounts of gypsum and limestone.Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains.Process characteristics of clinker and cement productionCement production process: Thermal energy demand and CO 2 emissions 30% fuel emissions thermal energy prod.process emissions from calcination of limestone 60% 10% electric power consumption,indirect emissions Limestone Quarry Filter Clinker Cement Cement Mills Raw Mill Calcination Cement Constituents Crusher FanDrying Rotary Kiln Preheater

## What Is the Cement Manufacturing Process? (with pictures)
Oct 29,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Afterward,the material is sent to a clinker cooler where the temperature lowers to a reasonable level,at which point the material can be stored once again.The cement manufacturing process is completed when the cooled clinker is ground once again in a rotating finishing mill.Cement Kilns: Grate CoolersOn the other hand,a typical Thamesside wet process kiln of the 1950s,consuming 8.0 GJ t,would use 3.04 kg of air per kg clinker,and could therefore obtain very low clinker temperatures without (theoretically) any waste air production.Grate coolers were developed in the historical context of these less efficient kilns,and so the issue of
