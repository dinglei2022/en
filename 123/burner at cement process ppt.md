01 In the process of clinkerisation,it is seen,that around 55% of the total heat input,is only utilised for clinkerisation Waste gases account for around 35% of total heat input Heat balance (per kg of clinker) for a typical cement plant,is depicted in Table ,Clinker Burning Kinetics and Mechanismthe core of the entire cement producing process: the clinker formation the rotary kiln in Thus,in order to maintain or even improve clinker quality (and ),we need a better understanding of output the development of clinker properties inside the kiln to react upon the impact of process chang
