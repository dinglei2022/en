## Mining activities Non renewable resources Metals salts.
2.Mining activities • Non renewable resources Metals,salts,rocks (granite,marble,etc.) • Ore extraction technique can improve our recovery and extend the resources • Essential for the economy of Canada and the world • The mining industry creates jobs and infrastructure (roads,power lines,etc.) • Often associated with major environmental problemsReading: OpenPit Mining Geology Lumen LearningEventually this layer will erode,but it is generally hoped that the rate of leaching or acid will be slowed by the cover such that the environment can handle the load of acid and associated heavy metals.There are no long term studies on the success of these covers due to the relatively short time in which large scale open pit mining has existed.

## Safety and Health Topics Toxic Metals Occupational.
Toxic metals,including "heavy metals," are individual metals and metal compounds that negatively affect people's health.Some toxic,semi metallic elements,including arsenic and selenium,are discussed in this page.In very small amounts,many of these metals are necessary to support life.However,in larger amounts,they become toxic.Pollution characteristics of surface runoff underAbstract.A great deal of manganese and associated heavy metals (such as Ni,Cu,Zn,Cd,Pb,etc.) was produced in manganese mining,smelting,and other processes and weathering and leaching of waste slag,which entered rainwater runoff by different means under the action of rainfall runoff.
