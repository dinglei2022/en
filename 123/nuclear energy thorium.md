## Thorium: the wonder fuel that wasn&#39;t Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists
11 May 2014.By the early 1960&#39;s,the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) had established a major thorium fuel research and development program,spurring utilities to build thorium fueled reactors.Back then,the AEC was projecting that some 1,000 nuclear power reactors would dot the American landscape by the&nbsp;.Thorium Nuclear Reactors and Energy AEN NewsThorium is a metal with radioactive properties that has the symbol Th and the atomic number 90 in the periodic table,and can be used as nuclear fuel in power plants to generate clean electricity.Thorium is a silvery metal with radioactive properties that was discovered in 1828 by J&#246ns Jakob Berzelius (a Swedish chemist) and was named after Thor (the famous Norse god of thunder).

## Why Aren&#39;t We Using Thorium in Nuclear Reactors.
7 May 2014.Cold War era governments (including ours) backed uranium based reactors because they produced plutonium — handy for making nuclear weapons.With some modifications,today&#39;s commercial nuclear reactors could switch to thorium based fuels,but at great cost.Thorium nuclear power might well be&nbsp;.Small thorium reactor Terrorism &amp; &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; and.Current discussion: Greenwashing Wikipedia manipulation nuclear lobby.Wikipedia web page on thorium based nuclear power.The wikipedia article about thorium based nuclear power includes very biased external links,which present thorium based nuclear power in a very positive light.Therefore,we tried to place&nbsp;.

## Thorium vs.Uranium Nuclear Energy: A Safer Energy Alternative.
22 Aug 2017.Nuclear power plants generate large amounts of reliable energy and don&#39;t release harmful carbon emissions.They also inspire fear of nuclear disasters and produce radioactive waste that we still don&#39;t have any way to dispose of safely.What if we could build nuclear reactors that produce much less waste,&nbsp;.Thorium: a safer nuclear power CSMonitor.com28 Mar 2014.In the same month as the Three Mile Island and Fukushima nuclear disasters,China announces it is speeding up its research into so called molten salt reactors that can run on thorium.If it succeeds,it would create a cheaper,more efficient,and safer form of nuclear power that produces less nuclear waste&nbsp;.

Nuclear power plants generate large amounts of reliable energy and don't release harmful carbon emissions.They also inspire fear of nuclear disasters and produce radioactive waste that we stillThorium could power the next generation of nuclear reactors New.25 Aug 2017.Thorium has long held promise for “safer” nuclear power.A slightly radioactive element,it transforms into fissionable U 233 when hit by high energy neutrons.But after use,U 233 creates fewer long lived radioactive waste products than the conventional U 235 now used in nuclear power plants.

## Thorium: new and improved nuclear energy Wise International
To make a &quot;thorium reactor&quot; work,one must (a) mix the thorium with plutonium that has been stripped of the highly radioactive fission products; (b) use the mixed oxide thorium plutonium fuel in a reactor,whereby the plutonium atoms fission and produce power while the thorium atoms absorb neutrons and are turned into&nbsp;.
