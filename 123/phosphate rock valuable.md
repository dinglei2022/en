Phosphate: A Strategic Mineral.The United States is the world's leading producer of phosphate rock.Our nation's phosphate deposits have long been recognized as a valuable natural resource.The U.S.receives significant revenue from exporting the mineral overseas,mostly to China.Treatment of phosphate rocks with hydrochloric acidPhosphate rocks were leached with hydrochloric acid and radium was removed by coprecipitation with BaSO 4.Uranium and lanthanides were extracted by di(2ethyl hexyl) phosphoric acid and tributyl phosphate.Phosphoric acid was then separated from calcium chloride solution and other impurities by extraction using undiluted isoamyl alcohol.
