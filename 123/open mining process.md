## Allinclusive Facts About the Diamond Mining Process
Diamond mining is a feat which requires precision,care,heavy duty extraction tools,and a substantial amount of monetary investment in machinery,to extract gems from the depths of the planet's crust.As a process,it consists of loing possible diamond deposits and their retrieval,in intact form.Process Mining: Data science in Action CourseraProcess mining is the missing link between modelbased process analysis and dataoriented analysis techniques.Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains.
