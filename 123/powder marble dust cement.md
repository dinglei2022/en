marble dust concrete in the strength of concrete They found that the increase of curing days would increase the strength but up to specific limit and after that the strength will decrease ( Rishi etal,2014),studied the experimental effect of replacement sand and or cement with marble waste powder or granular They noticed that thisPartial Replacement of Cement With Marble Powder in ConcretePartial Replacement of Cement With Marble Powder in Concrete,In this project our main objective is to study the influence of partial replacement of cement with marble powder,and to compare it with the compressive and tensile strength of ordinary M20 concrete,Marble powder: The marble dust is obtained from RAK ceramics The specific.
