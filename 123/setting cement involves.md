The words cement and concrete are often used interchangeably—and incorrectly.The material used for the rockhard surfaces that form sidewalks,driveways,and entry steps is known as concrete.One of the prime components of that concrete is cement—which is a fine gray powder made from pulverized calcined limestone and clay.It is this powdered cement that gives the bonding power and strengthCIVL 1101 Part 3 Properties of Portland CementRegulatedset cement modified Portland cement where the tricalcium aluminate is replaced with calcium fluoroaluminate.The result is more reactive than with water.Care has to be taken to avoid flash setting.By controlling flash setting,the handling time can range from 2

## 2.3 The Concrete Construction Process
As the concrete hardens and gains strength it becomes less and less vulnerable,so the critical time period is the first hours and days after it is placed.Proper curing of concrete generally comes down to two factors,keeping it moist and keeping it supported.Hydration of cement,as the word itself implies,involves reaction with water.Using Fly Ash in Concrete National Precast ConcreteMay 08,2010&nbsp&#0183&#32Certain fly ash can be used to keep the temperature from rising too high (less than 45 degrees).However,concrete with fly ash can set up normally or even rapidly,since many other factors control the set and strength development.Freezethaw durability may not be acceptable with the use of fly ash in concrete.
