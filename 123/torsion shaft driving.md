## Torsion Vibration Analysis of Propulsion
Torsion vibration of the propulsion shafting of a RoRo ship is calculated,which is propelled by one screw propeller driven by two 8ZAL40S engine.Calculation results of both free and forced torsion vibration are given.These results are checked according to the RulesStatic Fixturing and Testing of Torsional Shafts in Combined LoadingApr 22,2009.This project was out of necessity while in the process of developing composite drive shafts and the need to be capable of creating test.
