## copper processing Definition,History,&amp; Facts.
Copper processing: Copper processing.To increase the recovery of copper and reduce losses,the tailings are frequently reground and passed through a second.Tailings ReProcessing YANTAI FULIN MININGCopper tailings: If the precious metal content is high in copper tailings,the selection will be easy and generally use flotation process.Another copper tailings also contain magnetite,to such tailings,generally,use acid leaching to settle copper,then use magnetic process to select magnetite if need.
