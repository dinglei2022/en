Underground structures,tunnels,subways,metro stations and parking lots,are crucial components of the build environment and transportation networks.Considering their importance for life save and economy,appropriate seismic design is of prior significance.Structural design model for tunnels in soft soils: FromHowever,the common simplifiions of homogeneous soil conditions and homogeneous stress conditions in most structural design methods are less applicable for tunnels with limited cover in soft soils.There is a number of structural design models for the tunnel lining commonly used encompassing both analytical models and numerical models.
