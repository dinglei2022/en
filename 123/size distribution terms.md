## particle size distribution
The weight,or net volume,of solid particles that fall into each of the various size ranges,given as a percentage of the total solids of all sizes in the sample of interest.Particle size can be determined by sieve analysis,light scattering,passage through an electrically charged …Particle Size Conversion Table SigmaAldrich20191026&ensp&#0183&enspFor example,if the particle size of a material is described as 4 +40 mesh,then 90% or more of the material will pass through a 4mesh sieve (particles smaller than 4.76 mm) and be retained by a 40mesh sieve (particles larger than 0.420 mm).
