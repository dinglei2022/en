Process flow diagrams PFDs show how industrial process equipment is interconnected by a system of pipelin A PFD is more conceptual than a P&ID,and usually includes more annotations that display data Create a piping and instrumentation diagram In Visio,open any of the following templates: Piping and Instrumentation Diagram Process Flow.Diagrams for Understanding Chemical Processes 1.1.Block201273&ensp&#0183&enspFirst,a block flow diagram may be drawn for a single process.Alternatively,a block flow diagram may be drawn for a complete chemical complex involving many different chemical processes.These two types of diagrams are differentiated by calling the first a block flow process diagram and the second a block flow plant diagram.1.1.1.
