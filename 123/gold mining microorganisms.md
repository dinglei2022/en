## Accumulation of gold by microorganisms SpringerLink
Thirty species of microorganisms (8 bacteria,9 actinomycetes,8 fungi and 5 yeasts) were screened for maximal gold accumulation.Extremely high abilities to accumulate gold from a solution containing hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) were found in bacterial strains,such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas maltophilia.Most of the actinomycetes,fungi and yeasts had lower ability to …Researchers Discover Bacteria That Produces Pure GoldThe gold you see in the photo above was not found in a river or a mine.It was produced by a bacteria that,according to researchers at Michigan State University,can survive in extreme toxic
