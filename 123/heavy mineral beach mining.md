## Division of Geology and Mineral Resources Heavy Mineral
These heavy mineral deposits formed in beach and dune sands about 3 to 4 million years ago during the Pliocene Epoch,when the Atlantic Ocean shoreline was at a higher elevation near the present loion of Richmond.Ilmenite,leucoxene,rutile,and zircon make up approximately 80 percent of the heavy mineral concentrates produced by Iluka.Heavy mineral sands ore deposits Wikipedia20191028&ensp&#0183&enspHeavy mineral sands are a class of ore deposit which is an important source of zirconium,titanium,thorium,tungsten,rareearth elements,the industrial minerals diamond,sapphire,garnet,and occasionally precious metals or gemstones.Heavy mineral sands are placer deposits formed most usually in beach environments by concentration due to the specific gravity of the mineral grains.Grade and tonnage distribution&ensp&#0183&ensp
