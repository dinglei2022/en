## Piston Manufacturing process Piston Cylinder (Engine)
Piston Manufacturing Process The pistons are usually manufactured by means of 1) CASTING (an object made by pouring molten metal or other material into a mould ) 2) FORGING (Forging is the operation.where the metal is heated and then a force is applied to manipulates the metals in such a way that the required final shape is obtainedMANUFACTURING PROCESSES FIT20181022&ensp&#0183&enspThe permanent mold casting is similar to the sand casting process In distinction from sand molds which are broken after each casting a permanent mold may be used for pouring of at least one thousand and up to 100,000 casting cycles.Manufacturing metal mold is much more expensive than manufacturing sand molds or investment casting process mold.

## Cylinder Heads an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The cylinder head is a threepiece assembly consisting of a lower member that contains the gas passages,serves as a mounting for the injector valves and the ignition plug,and forms part of the combustion chamber.The cylinder head itself is a pistonlike member retained by a flange held by eight screws to the lower member.ng (metalworking) Wikipedia 			 					 							 			 Honing (metalworking) WikipediaChinese20191012&ensp&#0183&enspHoning is an abrasive machining process that produces a precision surface on a metal workpiece by scrubbing an abrasive stone against it along a controlled path.Honing is primarily used to improve the geometric form of a surface,but may also improve the surface texture.Typical appliions are the finishing of cylinders for internal combustion engines,air bearing spindles and gears.Honing stones&ensp&#0183&ensp
