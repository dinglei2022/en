## Hammermills versus roller mills Worldgrain
This wasn't always the case.In the early days of compound feed milling,when raw materials were homegrown and power sources were either wind or water,the effort needed to grind or flake cereals into a form where animal uptake was optimized dictated that roller milling was a more economic and popular means of size reduction.How is flour made? What is plain flour? Is white flourThis crushing method makes it difficult to separate the white flour.Roller mills shear the grain open which makes it easier to scrape the endosperm away from the wheat bran and wheat germ to produce white flour.A small amount of the flour produced today is via the stoneground method (less than 1% of total production).

Grain processing as exemplified by flour milling (Fig 154) is essentially a physical process whereby the kernel is cleaned,adjusted to an appropriate moisture content and then mechanically reduced to the desired particle size to produce a flour and by products (eg bran) Where appropriate,flour production also involves fractionation—not only to separate bran,germ and endosperm from.Foodways in early farming societies: microwear and starch,Samenvatting This dissertation combines two different analytical methods,microwear and starch grain analysis,to investigate the uses of different types of grinding tools The artefacts were excavated from the sites of Jiahu (c 7000 5500 BC) and Tanghu (c 7000 5000 BC),two of the earliest Neolithic,

## Dressing methods of superabrasive grinding wheels: A
Turning and rolling methods are mostly used for the dressing of ordinary abrasive wheel.Grinding method is to dress the grinding wheel by the grinding action caused by the relative movement between the dressing tool and the grinding wheel.It is applied more in the dressing of ordinary abrasive grinding wheel and superabrasive grinding wheel.Influence of grinding on the preservation of starch grains,Among the different grinding techniques,dry grinding causes significant morphological changes to starch grains and consequently affects starch grain detection,especially in the case of rice This result suggests that the scarcity of rice starch grains recovered from grinding tools in Neolithic Chinese sites could be caused by the employment of the dry grinding technique by ancient communiti
