## Looser steel production curbs to support iron ore demand
201981&ensp&#0183&enspSHANGHAI,Aug 1 (SMM) Potential,accelerated production at steel mills in Tangshan will fuel demand for iron ore and continue to provide strong support to ore prices in August.The upside room in iron ore prices will be capped as growing raw materials costs drove steelmakers into losses.SMMIron Production Chemistry LibreTextsThe production of iron from its ore involves an oxidationreduction reaction carried out in a blast furnace.Iron ore is usually a mixture of iron and vast quantities of impurities such as sand and clay referred to as gangue.The iron found in iron ores are found in the form of iron oxides.

## Projection of Iron Ore Production SpringerLink
Production is estimated to have a choppy plateau starting in 2017 until 2050 after which production rapidly declines.The undulating plateau is due to Chinese iron ore production peaking earlier followed by Australia and Brazil in turn.Iron Ore Statistics and Information usgs.gov20191027&ensp&#0183&enspIron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.It is therefore essential for the production of steel,which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base.Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking.Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries.
