Bauxite Mining & Resources in Indonesia October 2011 Fact & Fact about Indonesian Bauxite Mine & Resource : Vast bauxite resources,particularly on the western part of the archipelago (western part of Borneo,eastern coast of Sumatera) High quality & relatively easy to process bauxite,lead to low direct production costPrecision Surface Mining at African Bauxite Mine in AfricaSep 30,2020&#0183;&#32;Around 50,000 metric tonnes to 100,000 metric tonnes (55,000 t to 110,000 t) of bauxite is extracted each time The material produced ranges in size,so additional screening and crushing is necessary,which can certainly have a major impact on our operational costs” SMB found precision surface mining methods to be much more straightforward.
