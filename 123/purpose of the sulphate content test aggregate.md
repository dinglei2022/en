## Sulfate attack in concrete
Sulfate attack in concrete and mortar Sulfate attack can be 'external' or 'internal' External: due to penetration of sulfates in solution,in groundwater for example,into the concrete from outside Internal: due to a soluble source being incorporated into the concrete at the time of mixing,gypsum in the aggregate,for example External sulfate attack.A study on types and quality of aggregates used in,1097 and ASTM C give methods of testing aggregat Organic impurity test of fine aggregate is done to find out whether it is necessary to perform the test for the effect of organic impurities on the strength of mortar To ensure durability of concrete Sodium Sulfate or Magnesium Sulfate soundness test for aggregate is done

## Permissible Levels of Chlorides and Sulfates in Aggregate,
Feb 01,1996&#0183;&#32;Q We're designing a concrete structure in Egypt,and I received test results for the aggregate to be used in the concrete The report lists chloride and sulfate content,but I don't know how to evaluate these numbers because ASTM C 33,"Standard Specification for Concrete Aggregates," doesn't give limits for themAggregate Testing Definition,Flakiness &amp Elongation Index2018719&ensp&#0183&enspThis test is intended to serve as a rapid field test to show the relative proportions of fine dust or clay like material in aggregate.This test is useful for rapid assessment when either time or facilities available do not permit the full method of fine dust content by wash sieving.

## Sulfate Attack and Sulfate Content in Concrete: A,
Jan 14,2017&#0183;&#32;Internal sulfate attack occurs when a source of sulfate is incorporated in the concrete when mixing like excess gypsum in cement,sulfate in the aggregate,EFFECT OF SULFUR TRIOXIDE CONTENT ON CONCRETE,Additionally,increasing SO3 content increases strength loss for mortar exposed to sodium sulfate solution Drying shrinkage measurements indicate that increasing SO3 beyond 3% increases the drying shrinkage for all cements Concrete strength data indicate that for cements low in alkali and aluminate content,increasing the SO3 to 36%.
