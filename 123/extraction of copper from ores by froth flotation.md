Copper Mining: The commonest ore used in the extraction of copper is Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) also known as Copper Pyrites and other such sulfides.The percentage of copper in the actual ore is too low for direct extraction of copper to be viable.The concentration of ore is required and it is done by the Froth Flotation method.Concentration of Ore:Column Flotation Eriez Flotation DivisionEFD is the world leader in column flotation technology with over 900 installations.Columns are used for floating wellliberated ores.froth flotation

## Froth Flotation and Gold Extraction
Froth flotation is a method for separating hydrophobic materials (which will not mix with water) from hydrophilic materials (which readily mix with water).Since its discovery,froth flotation has been a major component for the processing of sulfide rich ores,including copper,coal,and refractory gold.Froth Flotation of Iron Ores sapubWith the depleting reserves of highgrade iron ore in the world,froth flotation has become increasingly important to process intermediate and lowgrade iron ore in an attempt to meet the rapidly growing demand on the international market.In over half a century's practice in the iron ore industry,froth flotation has been established as an efficient method to remove impurities from iron ore.

Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores.The procedure of copper processing involves mining and transporting.Oxide ores are generally processed through hydrometallurgy heap leaching,solvent extraction and electrowinning.The sulfide ores are usually processed using the method of pyrometallurgy froth floatation,thickening.Technical Resource Document: Extraction and …27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Each profile addresses extraction and beneficiation of ores.The scope of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as it applies to mining waste was amended in 1980 when Congress passed the Bevill Amendment,Section 3001(b)(3)(A).The Bevill Amendment states that &quot;solid waste from extraction,
