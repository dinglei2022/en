## Steam Power Plant Working Principle Schematic Diagram
A steam power station basically works on the Rankine cycleSteam is produced in the boiler by utilising the heat of coal combustionThe steam is then expanded in the prime mover (ie,steam turbine) and is condensed in a condenser to be fed into the boiler againThe steam turbine drives the alternator which converts mechanical energy of the turbine into electrical energyThis type of power.Biomass plant how it works VattenfallA biomass fired power plant produces electricity and heat by burning biomass in a boiler The most common types of boilers are hot water boilers and steam boilers Wood chips,residues and other types of biomass are used in the boilers,in the same way as coal,natural gas and oil

## Thermal Power Plant Operation Mechanicaltutorial
The boiler is an essential equipment of the thermal power plant operation In the boiler,heat is produced by coal combustion,is utilised to convert water into steam at high pressure and temperatureGenerating Electricity from Coal Duke EnergyWe also carefully manage coal combustion residuals and potential impacts to air,water and land,the steam is drawn into a large chamber in the basement of the power plant In this important step,millions of gallons of cool water from a nearby source (such as a river or lake) are pumped through a network of tubes running through the.
