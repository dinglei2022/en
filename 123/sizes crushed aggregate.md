Another factor may be related with the bigger aggregate sizes preventing the load from uniformly distributing since it leads to more heterogeneity in the concrete matrix,namely for CCW (Wang et al.2013 Xu et al.2018).As seen in Fig.3,Fig.4,the CSS of concrete mixes decrease as coarser aggregates are used.Crushed Limestone Sizes Chart bovenindewolkenCrushed Stone: Limestone,Granite,Traprock and More Geology.A significant amount of the material reported as &quotlimestone&quot in the pie chart in the right column of this page is actually,Crushed limestone of various particle sizes,from top left going clockwise: coarse aggregate,crushed limestone.Read More
