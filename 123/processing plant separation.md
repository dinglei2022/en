Cryogenic separation is a processing operation that is commonly used to extract natural gas liquids (NGLs) from raw natural gas.Unlike absorption methods,which are used primarily for extracting heavier NGLs,cryogenic processes are used to separate out lighter hydrocarbons such as ethane,propane,and butane from an incoming stream.Separation of hydrogen and LPG from refinery fuel gas.Separation of hydrogen from a bulk quantity of heavy components requires particular adjustments that should be regarded for the heat exchanger design.It has turned out to be of advantage for the design requirements of this cryogenic concept that Linde offers process design,equipment design and equipment manufacturing in one hand.

## Plant extraction
2020 3 3&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Plant extraction is a process that aims to extract certain components present in plants.It is a solid liquid separation operation: a solid object (the plant) is placed in contact with a fluid (the solvent).The plant components of interest are then solubilised and contained within the solvent.The solution thus obtained is the desired extract.Crude Oil Processing on Offshore Facilities1.0 PURPOSE.This design guide is prepared to provide basic information and consideration for the process design aspect of Crude Oil Processing for typical offshore facilities.This document provides an overview of separation of crude oil from well fluid for further processing.

## Examine inlet separation technologies for increased.
Contamination ingression into gas processing units is one of the most prevalent modes negatively affecting plant operations.To enable plants to run with minimal instabilities,increased capacity and high reliability,it is necessary to perform inlet separation to remove unwanted contaminants in the gas feed prior to processing.Membrane technology Dairy Processing HandbookMembrane technology is a proven separation method used on the molecular and ionic levels.Since the beginning of the 1970s,this technique has been adapted for the dairy industry.Flux = the rate of extraction of permeate measured in litres per square metre of membrane surface area per hour (l m 2 h) Membrane fouling = deposition and.
