## Geological and geochemical evolution of the Bolkardaği
The three bauxite zones have dimensions of 230 m by 70 m,125 m by 50 m,150 m by 60 m,respectively.According to drillings that were made (Demireller Co.unpublished reports),the average thickness of the bauxite zones is 15 m.The bauxite ore is reddish,grey,white,and greenishred and is represented by pisolitic and oolitic structures.The "coal bauxite iron" structure in the orebearing rockBauxite deposits in southeastern Guizhou occur in the lower Permian Liangshan Formation.The rock series bearing the sedimentary bauxite exhibit a typical "coal bauxite iron" structure,in which the lower part consists of bauxitic shale intercalated with siderite concretions,the middle part consists of bauxitic rock intercalated with multilayer lenticular or earthy bauxite,and the
