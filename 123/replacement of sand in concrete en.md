## Can waste foundry sand fully replace structural concrete
Control mixes containing only regular concrete sand were first made subsequently,waste FS replaced regular sand at increasing percentages per total sand mass,until full replacement (Table 2).For consistent comparisons,the water cement ratio (w c) was kept constant for each set of mixes (i.e.w c = 0.55 or 0.45,respectively).SpecimensStrength and durability of recycled aggregate concrete2012220&ensp&#0183&enspStrength and durability of recycled aggregate concrete containing milled glass as partial replacement for cement RozUdDin Nassar⇑,Parviz Soroushian Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering,3546 Engineering Building,Michigan State University,East
