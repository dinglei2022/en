## Experimental investigations of hydraulic and mechanical,
The addition of cement to granite residual soil can help eliminate the distribution of large pores,reduce the connectivity of pores,and increase the number of isolated por Fewer hydration products were generated by cement and pore water in soil,and the impact on the soil pores was relatively limited in the case of low cement content (2 4%)Cement Grinding PlantThe cement grinding plant mainly used in crushing and preheating of raw materials,and grinding and packaging of cement And it is mainly applied to deal with industrial solid wastes like slag,coal ash,coal gangues,and so on Therefore,it contributes great to the environment protection industry Our cement grinding plant has the features of.
