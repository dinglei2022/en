## Tooth Decay and Abscesses
Gold is an excellent material for filling teeth.It has good wear compatibility to the enamel of opposing and adjacent teeth.Gold adapts very well to the edges of a cavity and is totally inert or nontoxic.However gold is expensive,is unsightly in color,and is technically challenging to use.Therefore,gold fillings are rarely performed anymore.Gold Metallurgy &amp; Leaching in Cyanicides4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Cyanidation as applied to ordinary gold and silver ores is a relatively simple process.When cyanicides {cyanide consuming elements) are encountered in small amounts in the treatment of such ores,the various schemes already discussed,such as use of a lead salt or wasting barren solution,can usually be resorted to and successful operation maintained.
