## Acidbase Behavior of the Oxides Chemistry LibreTexts
Sodium Oxide.Sodium oxide is a simple strongly basic oxide.It is basic because it contains the oxide ion,O 2,which is a very strong base with a high tendency to combine with hydrogen ions.Reaction with water: Sodium oxide reacts exothermically with cold water to produce sodium hydroxide solution.A concentrated solution of sodium oxide in water will have pH 14.DOWEX™ Ion Exchange Resins Dow ChemicalUPCORE™ System Reduces Boron to Undetectable Levels in Ultrapure Water.Yagi,Y.; Hayashi,F.; Uchitomi,Y.; "Evaluation of boron behavior in ultrapure water.resistivity an dissolved silica RO DI system," Ultra Pure Water 13,pp.22 26.
