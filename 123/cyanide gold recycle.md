17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;broad generalisation,cyanide recovery will produce more favorable economics than cyanide destruction in those cases where potentially recoverable cyanide consumption is greater than 1 kg t NaCN,or exceeds 1000 tons NaCN per annum.WHY RECYCLE CYANIDE? LOWER COSTS • Recycled cyanide is 3 times cheaper than new cyanide.Greengold TECHNOLOGYRECYN is the worldleading approach in cyanide recovery,metal recovery and tailings detoxifiion.Based on an innovative resinbead absorbent,RECYN reduces cyanide consumption by 50%,capturing free cyanide from the plant tailings and recycling it back into the leach circuit while recovering metal complexes and making them available for sale.
