## How do you work design to wet mix macadam Answers
Wet Mix Macadam,or WMM,is a type of road that is built using smaller aggregates and binders mixed with water to provide a sublayer that can be blacktopped with bituminous layers.What is the difference between WBM and WMM withWater bound macadam roads(WBM): Aggregates are placed one over the other and binded them in the presence of water.SO it is called water bound and macadam is the name of civil engineer who found that inferior material should be at bottom and super
