## Development of a recycling process for tantalum from
A process based on oxidation treatment at elevated temperature,followed by mechanical separation and chemical treatment,was investigated to develop an effective process for recycling tantalum from capacitor scraps.By this process,tantalum oxide powder,free of SiO 2 or other impurities,was recovered from capacitor scrap.Tantalum powderTantalum Mining,Surface Mining,Underground Mining,Tantalum is produced by the processing and refining of its ore tantalite.Tantalite is the mineral ore containing tantalum.Most tantalum mines are open pit whereas some are underground.The mining process involves blasting,crushing and transporting the tantalite ore to start the process of separating tantalum.
