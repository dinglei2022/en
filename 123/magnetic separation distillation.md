## Separation Techniques Classifiion of Matter
Magnetic Separation.Magnetic separation is a process in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force.This separation technique can be useful in mining iron as it is attracted to a magnet.Magnetism is ideal for separating mixtures of two solids with one part having magnetic properties.Magnetic Separation Mine Engineer.Com2013113&ensp&#0183&enspMagnetic separation is generally a low cost method of recovery,unless high intensity separators are required.The electromagnetic high intensity separators that produce 20,000 gauss,tend to be expensive.However,the rare earth magnetic separators are relatively inexpensive and can produce magnetic fields around 6,000 gauss.
