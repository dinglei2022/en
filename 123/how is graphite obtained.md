## Materials Free FullText Characterization of Graphite
Graphite oxides obtained by method B (modified Tour's method) were characterized by higher content of oxygen groups in comparison to method A (Hummers' method).The flake graphite,characterized by the largest diameter of crystallites,proved to be the most suitable material for(PDF) Characterization of Graphite Oxide and ReducedGraphite oxides were obtained from scale,ﬂake and synthetic graphites by two methods denoted.A and B (commercial graphite powders were ground in a planetary ball mill and sieved to a particle.
