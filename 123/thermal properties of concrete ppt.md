&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Thermal Properties of concrete:: Thermal Properties of concrete: Definition: Thermal properties of a concrete can be defined as the effect of the heat and high temperature on the concrete.These effect are varied and always vividly spread on the surface of concrete.Some of these effect can be scrutinized materially and some are quite abstract.Concrete Wikipedia2019116&ensp&#0183&enspConcrete has a very low coefficient of thermal expansion and shrinks as it matures.All concrete structures crack to some extent,due to shrinkage and tension.Concrete that is subjected to longduration forces is prone to creep.Tests can be performed to ensure that the properties of concrete correspond to specifiions for the appliion.
