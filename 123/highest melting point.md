## Melting point Define Melting point at Dictionary.com
For a given substance,the melting point of its solid form is the same as the freezing point of its liquid form,and depends on such factors as the purity of the substance and the surrounding pressure.The melting point of ice at a pressure of one atmosphere is 0°C (32°F); that of iron is 1,535°C (2,795°F).Creative Chemistry Trend in melting points of Group 2 elementsThe Group 2 elements are all metals with metallic bonding,so you expect their melting points to be high.In metallic bonding,metal cations in a metal lattice are attracted to delocalised electrons.Going down Group 2: the number of delocalised electrons remains the same.the charge on each metal cation stays the same at&nbsp;.
