Another process involves ground ore being passed over plates which are coated with mercury.The gold and the mercury form an amalgam,leading to the name of the process,amalgamation.Once the amalgam has formed,it is heated until the mercury gas is boiled off,leaving the gold.The mercury gas is highly toxic and must be handled carefully.9 Step Process for Discovering,Mining &amp Refining GoldGold miners too take special care to make the impact of mining for gold as light as possible.Reclaiming land to its previous natural state is the final and perhaps most important step to ensuring the process of obtaining gold doesn't result in permanent damage to the landscape.
