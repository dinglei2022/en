## GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR THE SAMPLING OF SOILS
A detailed sampling strategy shall be formulated for each site to be sampled.The theoretical sampling strategy provides a plan of what and where to measure,how many sampling units to collect,the time frame over which sampling units should be collected,the sampling frequency and the depth of sampling.Sampling TechniquesSampling Techniques.Wastewater sampling is generally performed by one of two methods,grab sampling or composite contains effluent below the flow line.

## Placer mining Wikipedia
The methods used by the Roman miners are described by Pliny the Elder in his work Naturalis Historia published in about 77 AD.The author was a Procurator in the region and so probably witnessed largescale hydraulic mining of the placer deposits there.He also added that the local lake Curacado had been heavily silted by the mining methods.Retreatment of Residues and Waste Rock SAIMMRetreatment of Residues and Waste Rock D.W.Bosch 12.1 Introduction From the commencement of gold mining on the Witwatersrand in 1887 up to 1984,a total of approximately 4,2 billion tons of gold ore has been milled The Sandrill is the most effective of the sampling methods mentioned.

## Mining Wikipedia
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth,usually from an ore body,lode,vein,seam,reef or placer deposit.These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.Ores recovered by mining include metals,coal,oil shale,gemstones,limestone,chalk,dimension stone,rock salt,potash,gravel,and clay.ZhiHua Zhou's Publiions Nanjing UniversityOn the effectiveness of sampling for evolutionary optimization in noisy Proceedings of the 7th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'07),Omeha,NE,2007,pp.721726.D.Zhang,Z T.D.Le,L.Liu,Z.H.Zhou,and J.Li.Mining heterogeneous causal effects for personalized cancer treatment.Bioinformatics
