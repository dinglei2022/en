## CIP 36 Structural Lightweight Concrete
Lightweight concrete is typically manufactured with combinations of normalweight and lightweight aggregates.Using all coarse and fine lightweight aggregates in a concrete mixture can decrease the concrete density to less than 90 lb ft3 3(1440 kg m ).Structural design of lightweightNotes Engineering: EFFECT OF DIFFERENT LIGHTWEIGHTThere are three possible loions of the air: (1) in the aggregate particles,which are known as lightweight aggregates and resulting concrete is known as lightweight aggregate concrete,(2) in the cement paste,the resulting concrete being known as cellular concrete,(3) between the coarse aggregate
