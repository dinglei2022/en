## Fly ash Wikipedia
Fly ash or flue ash,also known as pulverised fuel ash in the United Kingdom,is a coal combustion product that is composed of the particulates (fine particles of burned fuel) that are driven out of coalfired boilers together with the flue gases.Ash that falls to the bottom of the boiler's combustion chamber (commonly called a firebox) is called bottom ash.Coal Combustion Residues (CCRs) Office of Surface MiningCoal combustion residues (CCRs),more commonly known as coal ash,is a byproduct of the combustion of coal at power plants which is disposed of in liquid form at large surface impoundments and in solid form at landfills.Research into the safest methods of disposal,as well as potential benefits of other uses for CCRs is being conducted.
