## On the evaporation of ammonium sulfate solution
Nov 10,2009&nbsp&#0183&#32In extending these studies to ammonium sulfate solutions,we report the value of γ e as defined by Eq.2.Here,however,p sat is the equilibrium vapor pressure of the solution,rather than that of pure water.Because this vapor pressure is ≈13% lower than that of pure water,the maximum theoretical evaporation rate for the solution is lower than that of pure water.Sulphuric acid + ammonium sulphate — Sandvik MaterialsSulphuric acid + ammonium sulphate.These corrosion data are mainly based on results of general corrosion laboratory tests,carried out with pure chemicals and water solutions nearly saturated with air (the corrosion rate can be quite different if the solution is free from oxygen).

## Ammonium sulfate Wikipedia
Ammonium sulfate is made by treating ammonia,often as a byproduct from coke ovens,with sulfuric acid: 2 NH 3 + H 2 SO 4 → (NH 4) 2 SO 4.A mixture of ammonia gas and water vapor is introduced into a reactor that contains a saturated solution of ammonium sulfate and about 2Lecture 10 Ammonium Sulphate nptel.acAmmonium Sulphate Ammonium sulfate was once the leading form of nitrogen fertilizer,but it now supplies a solution Heat of dilution 6.35 kcal kg from 42% to1.8% solutions Melting point 512.20C Ammonium sulfate is commonly shipped in polyethylene or paper bags.

## Standard enthalpy of formation Wikipedia
The standard enthalpy of formation or standard heat of formation of a compound is the change of enthalpy during the formation of 1 mole of the substance from its constituent elements,with all substances in their standard states.The standard pressure value p ⦵ = 10 5 Pa (= 100 kPa = 1 bar) is recommended by IUPAC,although prior to 1982 the value 1.00 atm (101.325 kPa) was used.Enthalpy of dilution in aqueous systems of single solutesThe enthalpy of dilution in the sodium sulfatewater,ammonium sulfatewater and ammoniawater systems was measured at temperatures from 313 to 373 K with a Calvettype batch calorimeter using specially designed mixing cells.
