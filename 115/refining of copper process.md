## How copper is made material,used,processing,steps
To remove or adjust the levels of these materials,the blister copper is first fire refined before it is sent to the final electrorefining process.8 The blister copper is heated in a refining furnace,which is similar to a converter described above.Air is blown into the molten blister to oxidize some impurities.The Extraction of Copper Chemistry LibreTextsThe Process.The concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica) and air or oxygen in a furnace or series of furnaces.The copper(II) ions in the chalcopyrite are reduced to copper(I) sulfide (which is reduced further to copper metal in the final stage).

## Electrorefining of Copper
Electrorefining of Copper 1.Electrorefining General Introduction In an electrorefining process,the anode is the impure metal and the impurities must be lost during the passage of the metal from the anode to the cathode during electrolysis,i.e.the electrodeSmelting and refining Glossary Sumitomo Metal MiningSmelting and refining.At SMM's Toyo facilities in Ehime Prefecture,the copper concentrate preprocessing undertaken at Saijo uses pyrometallurgical processes and the nickel refining at the Niihama site uses hydrometallurgical processes entirely.The term 'refining' refers to any process that increases the grade or purity of a

## Refining (metallurgy)
The refined blister copper is poured into casting molds lined up side by side on the revolving circular table of a casting wheel and cast into anode plates for electrolytic refining.The anode plates are approximately 1m x 1m x 0.05m in size,and weigh 380 kg per plate.process for the electrolytic refining of copperCopper Purification Process Electrolytic Copper Refining Copper Electrolytic Refining Process In the electrolytic refining of copper,a thin sheet of high purity Cu serves as the cathode.The blister copper plates are taken and used as anodes in an electrolyte bath of copper sulfate,CuSO4,and sulfuric acid H2SO4.
