## Coal Gasification Related Industries
China is the only country in the world,where large scale coal gasification related industries play a significant role in economy development China’s coal gasification related plants have the world’s largest single train capacity,and advanced and reliable performance 1 Background of MCGI 13 MCGI is a valuable sector in ChinaIndia turns to Lurgi and JSPL to revive Talcher fertiliserApr 29,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32In an attempt to revive the Rs9,000crore Talcher fertiliser plant in Odisha,the Indian government has turned to Lurgi Technology Co.SA's coal gasifiion technology.While gas produced from coal gasifiion is to be used as fuel for fertiliser

## Gasification India 2018
• Clue from China coal gasification technology expansion 121 operating plants and 57 under construction coal gasification plants • Total 400 gasifiers (322 in China) 11 built by L&T • About 300 mmscmd equivalent NG production in China • China coal consumption 10 MTPD,India is 2 MTPD • China consumption in gasification is 16 MTPDThar Coal Gasification to produce FertilizerApr 29,2019&#0183;&#32;Nevertheless,I stand by my assertion that it is much cheaper to produce Urea from LNG than from Thar coal This because in the capital requirement for a Urea plant from methane LNG is a fraction of the capital outlay for the mining + gasification of coal + conversion of Syngas into Urea
