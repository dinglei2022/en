## Innovations in Copper: Electrical and Metallurgy of Copper
This property makes it the preferred material for power and telecommuniions cables,magnet (winding) wire,printed circuit board conductors and a host of other electrical appliions.Copper has sufficient strength,ductility and hardness for these appliions at operating temperatures up to 210 F (100 C).Wire ends yield failure clues EDNIn contrast,if current increases suddenly,perhaps due to a short circuit,you often see a small ball of copper on one of the fused wire ends (Figure 5).In general,surfacetension forces in the liquid copper—melted by the high current—can form a ball or can round the end of a wire.Tensile failure

Considerable scrap must be physically treated to isolate its copper from its other components.An important example of this is recovery of copper from wire and cable.It is done by: chopping the wire and cable into small pieces to liberate its copper physically isolating its copper by means of a specific gravity separation (air table).Basic metallurgy for welders The FABRICATORApr 06,2011&nbsp&#0183&#32They also fail to provide the heat and electrical conductivity information (physical metallurgy),but this information is important to know,especially when welding aluminum or copper and their alloys.Therefore,although these charts are valuable to welders,they do not necessarily provide enough information to successfully perform a sound weld.
