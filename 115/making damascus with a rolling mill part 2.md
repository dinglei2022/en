## Who actually forges their damascus by hand?
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;almost everybody who makes damascus will do it with the aid of a power hammer or press or rolling mill of some kind.Unless you are just making it to enjoy the work them there is no way damascusdamascus sheet?&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;If you are talking jewelry rolling mill I'm almost certain that the answer is going to be no.They are not meant to roll hot metal only nonferrous metals.The steel at temperatures hot enough to roll would ruin the mill.The thing that might work to produce sheet is a hydraulic press like the knife make use to make Damascus billets in the first.

## Damascus: cut and stack,or fold? BladeForums
2016329&ensp&#0183&enspHi everyone,I just started making knives with the goal of making damascus knives.I just completed my 1st damascus blade and after making the billet I'm wondering if theres a better way or if it will always take way more steel than you'd think.Designing a Rolling Mill&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;After playing around with the idea of getting a power hammer or press,Ive decided that a far more sensible idea would be to make a rolling mill,as it would be quieter and smaller than the alternatives,and would actually do what I need it to better.Ill mainly be drawing out and tapering knives.
