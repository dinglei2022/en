## Wisconsin Geological &amp Natural History Survey &#187 Galena
GREEN COUNTY: Galena was mined at the old lead diggings near Clarno (Heyl and West,1959).— Galena was found associated with cerussite at large old mine sites such as the Newkirk Mine (N 1 2 SW Sec.24 T.3N R.6E) near Blue Mounds (Heyl et al.1959).Lead Carbonate (Cerussite) Beneficiation by GravityTreatment of oxidized lead ores (Cerussite) has long been recognized as a difficult process often resulting in low grade concentrates and low recoveries.Surface oxidation on galena ores has resulted in high tailings losses.The difficulty in treating oxidized lead ores by gravity methods is due to the softness of the oxidized lead minerals.
