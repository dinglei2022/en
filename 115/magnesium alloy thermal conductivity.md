## AZ91D Properties Magnesium Alloy AZ91D Dynacast
Alloy AZ91D is the most widely used magnesium die cast alloy and has an excellent combination of mechanical properties,corrosion resistance,and castability.Corrosion resistance is achieved by enforcing very strict limits on three metallic impurities—iron,copper and nickel.Welding of Magnesiumbase Alloys Total MateriaWelding of Magnesiumbase Alloys Abstract: Magnesium has high thermal heat conductivity and a high coefficient of thermal expansion.The thermal conductivity is not as high as aluminum but the coefficient of thermal expansion is very nearly the same.The absence of color change is not too important with respect to the arc welding processes.
