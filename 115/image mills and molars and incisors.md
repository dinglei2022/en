## How to Tell the Age of a Puppy using their Teeth Embark
Jul 10,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Teeth are a reliable measure of age whether your pup is a rescue or not.In fact,studying your dog's teeth may be the most accurate resource when investigating how to tell the age of a puppy.Teeth are a particularly reliable way to determine a puppy's age because your dog will lose all baby teeth before he she is about 6 months old.Illustration Picture of Teeth Teeth Structure and FunctionThe periodontal ligaments are tough connective tissues that anchor the teeth into the jawbone.By the age of 18 to 21,adults have 32 permanent teeth.These include 8 incisors,4 canines,8 premolars,8 molars,and 4 wisdom teeth.Many young adults have their wisdom teeth removed to prevent crowding of the teeth.

## Human Teeth and Evolution ThoughtCo
Incisors are the four front teeth on the top jaw (the maxilla) and the four teeth directly below them on the lower jaw (the mandible).These teeth are thin and relatively flat compared to the other teeth.They are also sharp and strong.The purpose of the incisors is to tear flesh from animals.Equine Dentistry Photos MW Veterinary ServicesA horse with slanted incisors is unable to achieve this grinding stroke because the incisors do not separate through the chewing cycle,so the cheek teeth do not fully engage.Over time the cheek teeth will begin to wear unevenly,further decreasing the ability of the horse to chew.The photo below is the same horse after correction.
