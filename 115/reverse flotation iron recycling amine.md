Typically,for a primary amine,the ionization starts to foil off in the range of pH 10 or greater,thus defining the window of potential use as a collector to be less than pH 10.The major practical use of amine collectors is in the flotation of silica (quartz) gangue particles away from other materials,a process denoted as reverse flotation.The nature of hematite depression with corn starch in theAug 15,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32The function of corn starch and the significance of the order of addition of corn starch and mono ether amine in the reverse flotation of iron ore has been investigated.Understanding hematite depression with starch and the corresponding hydrophilic state involves consideration of adsorption with amine as well as flocculation of fine hematite.
