## How canal and lock is made material,history,used
A canal is a manmade waterway.Canals are built for a variety of uses including irrigation,land drainage,urban water supply,hydroelectric power generation,and transportation of cargo and people.Navigation canals may be shallow facilities designed for barge traffic,or they may be deep enoughSuction excavator WikipediaHydro excavation lessens the risk of damaging utilities,which may often be inaccurately mapped and loed and marked on the surface.A suction excavator is useful in bulk excavation in confined areas,where its suction hose can reach in over or through barriers,e.g.digging a swimming pool in a courtyard.

onstruction cost estimating is demanding work,no matter what type of construction is involved.But I think estimating earthwork is the hardest of all.Why? For two reasons: First,excavation has more variables and unknowns — you don't know what's down there until you start digging second,you have to rely on information from manyTrenching and Excavation SafetyExcavation and trenching are among the most hazardous construction operations.OSHA defines an excavation as any manmade cut,cavity,trench,or depression in the earth's surface formed by earth removal.A trench is defined as a narrow underground excavation that is deeper than it is wide,and is no wider than 15 feet (4.5 meters).
