## Gallium Arsenide Powder Highly Pure At Lowest Price
Gallium Arsenide Powder is a semiconductor used for a variety of optoelectronic appliions due to its high absorption coefficient and carrier mobilit.Gallium arsenide based solar cells have demonstrated efficiencies as high as 29%.A critical loss mechanism in these devices is the reflection at the air Gallium arsenide interface.Whatever happened to GalliumArsenide? Why did the needThis is a great question,thanks.GaAs didn't go away.It just didn't go into mainstream cheapo electronics,it stuck with the niches that silicon just can't function in.And those niches are quite plentiful even in consumer devices.Ultimatel
