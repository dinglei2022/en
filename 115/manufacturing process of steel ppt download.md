## Energy Use in US Steel Manufacturing Robert B Laughlin
From the data in Table 1 and Fig 3 it is apparent that the production of hot metal or pig iron is the most energy intensive process for steel production at roughly 135 × 10 9 joules per ton (1000 Kg) of pig iron produced The basic oxygen furnace is the second most energy intensive process at 11 × 10 9 joules per ton or steel produced The Electric arc furnace has significantly less energy.CMOS Manufacturing ProcessDigital Integrated Circuits Manufacturing Process EE141 Circuit Under Design This two inverter circuit (of Figure 325 in the text) will be manufactured in a twin well process V DD V DD V in V out M1 M2 M3 M4 V 2
