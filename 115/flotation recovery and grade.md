## Flotation Circuit: Concentrate Grade and Recovery
Jun 19,2013&nbsp&#0183&#32The texture of particles within a flotation cell play a pivotal role in both mineral recovery,and the grade,in the flotation concentrate.Theoretical curves can be generated based on particle mineralogy and texture to indie the maximum graderecovery possible for a given feed ore.PyriteGold Recovery in Copper Rougher Flotation Tailingson its flotation was studied in a typical copper ore.A twostage (Cu and pyrite) rougher flotation indied that maximum Au recovery (95%) can only be achieved with pyrite flotation (recovery,93%).A decrease in grind size of the flotation feed from 70 &#181m to 38 &#181m and without pyrite flotation stage

## Reagent Optimization across a UG2 Plant IAENG
Reagent optimization is an important consideration for large PGMs processing operations because the correct improvement opportunities to flotation recovery and grade [5,6] Also,the cost of reagents typically runs into tens of millions of dollars per annum for a large PGMs operation,and therefore reagent optimization presents a,Timed Flotation Test &amp Cumulative Grade Recovery CurveThis illustration of a rougher feed flotation rate test for a slow floating nickel ore shows why a minimum of four data points are required.Three concentrate collection times are two,ten and twenty two minutes are shown as yellow circles on the two graphs of recovery versus time and recovery versus concentrate grade.
