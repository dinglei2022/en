## Coal preparation plant Wikipedia
A coal preparation plant (CPP also known as a coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP),coal handling plant,prep plant,tipple or wash plant) is a facility that washes coal of soil and rock,crushes it into graded sized chunks (sorting),stockpiles grades preparing it for transport to market,and more often than not,also loads coal into rail cars,barges,or ships.Power Plant Instrumentation and Control Handbook ElsevierHe has a number of national and international technical papers to his credit.With Elsevier BV had already authored books entitled "Power Plant instrumentation and control Handbook","Plant Hazard Analysis and Safety Instrumentation Systems" and "Plant Flow Metering and control handbook".
