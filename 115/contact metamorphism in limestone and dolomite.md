subordinate marly layers,a pure dolomite oolite and a marllimestone interbedded sequence of the Cencenighe Member.Contact metamorphism In the dolomite oolite contact metamorphism is evident from the successive formation of tremolite and forsterite and the disappearance of dolomite towards the intrusive contact.Metasomatism WikipediaBecause metamorphism usually requires water in order to facilitate metamorphic reactions,metamorphism nearly always occurs with metasomatism.Further,because metasomatism is a mass transfer process,it is not restricted to the rocks which are changed by addition of chemical elements and minerals or hydrous compounds.

Feb 24,2009&nbsp&#0183&#32Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3).It may contain considerable amounts of magnesium carbonate (dolomite) as well.Marble is a metamorphic rock resulting from regional or rarely contact metamorphism of sedimentary carbonate rocks,or metamorphism of older marble.Contact Metamorphism an overview ScienceDirect TopicsThe rocks of contact metamorphism are hornfels created from clay and pelite sediments and or tuffs.The skarn rocks are created from marl and clay limestone and dolomite (Table 6.1).The contact metamorphic marbles occur at the contact of the magma or lava with limestones and dolomites.

## Contact Metamorphism Tulane University
As discussed previously,contact metamorphism occurs as a result of a high geothermal gradient produced locally around intruding magma.Contact metamorphism is usually restricted to relatively shallow depths (low pressure) in the Earth because it is only at shallow depths where there will be a large contrast in temperature between the intruding magma and the surrounding country rock.Metamorphism and metamorphic rocks ppt SlideShareDec 12,2013&nbsp&#0183&#32Metamorphism and metamorphic rocks ppt 1.Metamorphism and metamorphic rocks • Rocks created by heat,pressure and or chemically reactive fluids • Metamorphic rocks are produced from • Igneous rocks • Sedimentary rocks • Other metamorphic rocks 2.
