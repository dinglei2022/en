## How Much Does Pyrite Cost? HowMuchIsIt
Aug 15,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32&#173Pyrite,the most common sulfide material,comes from a Greek word meaning "a stone which strikes fire." Its metallic luster and brassyellow color has earned it the moniker you have probably heard before,"fool's gold.Being used as an ore of iron for centuries,pyrite can be found in some jewelry or as a novelty collector's item.Wisconsin Geological &amp; Natural History Survey &#187; PyriteRUSK COUNTY: Pyrite is a major mineral in the massive sulfide,disseminated and stringer ore bodies in the Flambeau deposit,near Ladysmith (May,1977).Most of the pyirite is massive,but small cubes do occur in vuggy regions.The pyrite is often partially replaced by chalcocite and other copper sulfides in the mined supergene zone.
