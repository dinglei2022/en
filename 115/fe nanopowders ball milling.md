## Abstract Harvard University
Abstract The magnetoresistance (MR) in coldpressed magnetite nanopowders has been studied using pulsed magnetic field up to 42 T and steady field up to 12 T.Ball milling in air produces pure and stoichiometric Fe 3 O 4 grains of nanometric size coated by a thin layer of Fe 2 O 3,which electrically isolates the magnetite and acts as a tunnel barrier.Therefore,the intergrainFe&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Abstract.TiO 2 nanopowders,doped with Fe 3+ and Eu 3+ were obtained by high energy ball milling and their physical properties were investigated as a function of the doping content and ball milling time.A noticeable red shift and high photoactivity in the degradation and catalytic oxidation reactions of styrene and phenol were found for all doped specimens.
