## Heat pumps technology and environmental impact
The use of the ground as heat source for heat pumps enables the use of renewable energy stored in the soil or bedrock.The ground serves as seasonal storage of solar energy.At a depth of 0.91.5 m the amplitude of temperature change due to changes of outdoor HEAT PUMPS TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT July 2005: Part 1Condensate pump KSBA condensate pump is a centrifugal pump which is named after the type of fluid handled.It is used in condensers to pump out the condensed steam as water (condensate) in a technical vacuum (near vapour pressure).

pump is a machine used to transfer or move a volume of water (or fluid) a given distance.This volume is measured over a period of time expressed in gallons per minute (gpm) or gallons per hour (gph).This volume is also referred to as capacity or flow.Introduction to Pump Curves The pump develops energy called discharge pressureModule 23410 THE TURBINE LUBRICATING OIL SYSTEMAPPROVAL ISSUE Course 234 Turbine and Auxiliaries Module 10 stressed that these consequences.as much as they are unwelcome,are far more preferable than the very likely damage topoorly lubried bearing(s).The major concern caused by too high pressure oflubriing orjack&#173 ing oil is that it,increases the risk of system overpressure failure if the reliefvalve(s) failed to operate.
