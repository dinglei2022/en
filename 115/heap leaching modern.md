## A Brief Note on the Heap Leaching Technologies for the
Heap leaching is a lowcost technology used in industrial mining to recover precious metals such as gold and uranium,along with several other highly sought after metals like copper,from their primary resources (ores and minerals).For many decades,there has been a growing demand for heap leaching due to its environmental benefits.Heap leaching provides mining operators with a benignHeap leach conference comes home MINING.COMJul 29,2015&nbsp&#0183&#32Jeff Parshley: Nevada is a great place to do it because the modern heap leach operation developed for gold was developed in the State of Nevada in the 1980s.Nevada has been heap leaching
