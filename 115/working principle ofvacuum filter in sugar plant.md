Abstract: Rotary drum vacuum filters have been widely used in sugar and a variety of other industries for many years.They are well suited to appliions where both dewatering and washing are required and appear to be the best of the available equipment for the treatment of cane sugar muds.Vacuum FiltrationVacuum filtration usually involves the use of a vacuum filter flask,a filter trap,a water pump,and either a Buchner funnel or sintered glass crucible.The liquid mixture is poured into the filter (Buchner or sintered glass),the liquid is sucked down into the filter flask by the action of the water pump,and any excess liquid that overflows out of the filter flask is caught in the filter trap.

## Belt Filter
The gravity belt filter is a relatively simple device that is similar in general form to the horizontal belt filter (see Section 1.4.1.3) except separation is induced wholly by gravitational forces.Referring to Figure 1.55,the normally flocculated and dilute feed is introduced at one end of a continuously moving,semi permeable,belt.During translation with the belt,the ‘free water’ in.Vacuum Sugar Infiltration Principle vacuum Sugar,02 08 2021&#0183;&#32;Vacuum sugar infiltration: the use of vacuum sugar infiltration method can greatly shorten the entire immersion time (for example,it takes 3 to 20 days to pickle preserved fruit with traditional sugar,while vacuum sugar infiltration only takes 30 to 180 minutes)
