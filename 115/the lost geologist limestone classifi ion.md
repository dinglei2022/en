## Limestone Facts Softschools
Limestone is a sedimentary rock that contains at least 50% calcium carbonate (CaCO3).Because sedimentary rocks are made of various types of sediments,the other 50% of a limestone rock could be virtually any other mineral.Limestone originates in wet areas which mean it could also be composed of shells and waste matter from organisms.Classification of British limestones What is limestone,'Massive limestones' are those that are made of thick layers (called 'beds') of rock In England,these limestones are the older and harder types,such as the Carboniferous limestone The massive Carboniferous limestones originally accumulated in a warm shallow sea when Britain lay much closer to the equator than it does now

Limestone may be informally described by the type of carbonate it contains,such as calcite,aragonite and dolomite Again,geologists use more complicated classifications to describe limestone based on texture,formation and compositionCarbonate Classification SEPM StrataMost limestones are classified by Folk allochemical Rocks if they contain over l0% allochems (transported carbonate grains) Based on the percentage of interstitial material,the Rocks may be further subdivided into two groups: sparry allochemical limestones (containing a sparry calcite cement of clear coarsely crystalline mosaic calcite crystals) and microcrystalline allochemical limestone.
