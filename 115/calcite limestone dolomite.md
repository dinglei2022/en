Ya,applying dolomite lime will probably just make things worse.It may raise the pH temporarily,but raising the pH is not as important as avoiding the raising of the magnesium.You need to find calcitic lime (aka calcium carbonate,highcal lime,marking lime).It should be available somewhere,probably at a farm supply store.Dolomite sandatlasDolomite is a common rockforming mineral.It is the primary constituent of dolomite rock and dolomarble.It is similar to the most common carbonate mineral calcite.These two share some similarities in structure and are very closely related chemically.
