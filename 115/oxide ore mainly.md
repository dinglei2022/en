## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview IntechOpen
The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years,owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries.However,the content of iron in ore deposits has deteriorated and lowgrade iron ore has been processed.The fines resulting from the concentration process must be agglomerated for use in iron and steelmaking.This chapter shows the status of the pelletizing processGCSE Chemistry Metals PageThere are quite a lot of impurities present in the ore,mainly sand (silicon dioxide,SiO 2).This is removed by the limestone.When the limestone is heated in the furnace it decomposes to lime (calcium oxide) and oxygen.This calcium oxide reacts with the sand to produce a slag,calcium silie,CaSiO 3.CaCO 3(s) → CaO (s) + CO 2(g)
