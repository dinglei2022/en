## CarbonSense Sensor System Outotec
Outotec® CarbonSense is an in situ measurement system that helps to minimize gold solution losses in carbon in pulp (CIP) and carbon in leach (CIL) circuits by enabling reliable and repeatable online monitoring of carbon concentration.As the instrument is directly immersed in the slurry,no sample transfer is needed,and the measurement is always available for optimal carbon management.Gold Mining Process Development Denver Mineral Engineersleach solutions are frequently high in solids due to fine particle washing from heaps Down flow carbon columns are rarely used for gold recovery,because they act like sand filters and are subsequently subject to frequent plugging 2 Carbon In Pulp (CIP): Carbon in pulp operation is a variation of the conventional cyanidation process

## [PDF] Dynamic simulation of the carbon in pulp and carbon,
Carbon in leach and carbon in pulp are continuous processes that use activated carbon in a cascade of large agitated tanks,which have been widely used to recover or concentrate precious metals in gold extraction plants In the carbon in pulp process adsorption occurs after the leaching cascade section of the plant,and in the carbon in leach process leaching and adsorption occur simultaneouslyGold Leaching Carbon in Leach JXSC MachineGold Leaching( carbon in leach) was developed from CIP( Carbon In Pulp),is characterized by less process flow,timesaver in the leaching process,thus reducing the production expenditure Besides,advanced extraction technology improving the efficiency of gold extraction The CIL production line is wider use than CIP in the mineral industry
