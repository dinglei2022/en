## Separation process Wikipedia
A separation process is a method that converts a mixture or solution of chemical substances into two or more distinct product mixtures.At least one of results of the separation is enriched in one or more of the source mixture's constituents.In some cases,a separation mayFlotation Machines Mineral Processing &amp MetallurgyMetallurgical ContentAir Lift Flotation MachinesSouthwestern AirLift MachineMatless Flotation MachineCallowMaclntosh Machine Industrial flotation machines can be divided into four classes: mechanical pneumatic froth separation column airlift matless As pneumatic and froth separation devices are not commonly used in industry today,no further discussion about them will be given in

## Flotation: DAF,IAF,SAF Veolia Water
Flotation: DAF,IAF,SAF By Dave Christophersen,Vice President Technical Manager Flotation is a method of separating solids or liquids from water by introducing fine gas bubbles.The bubbles attach to the particulate matter,and the buoyant force of the combined particle and gas bubbles is great enough to cause the particle to rise to the surface.FLOTATION ThermopediaFlotation is a process in LiquidSolid Separation technology whereby solids in suspension are recovered by their attachment to gas (usually air) bubbles,usually with objective of removing the solids from the liquid.The particles most effectively removed are in the size range from 10 to 200 μm.The particlebubble aggregates that are formed have a density less than the suspension itself

For more than a century now,flotation has been at the heart of the mineral processing industry.In this month's SPOTLIGHT FEATURE ARTICLE,direct from the November issue of INTERNATIONAL MINING magazine,John Chadwick examines new technologies and appliions from some of the key players in mineral flotation,a technique that is so important to the global industry.Froth Flotation Process Mineral Processing &amp MetallurgyFROTH FLOTATION "So many variables influence flotation that it will be long before every one of them can be investigated and its influence on the process determined." The froth flotation process was patented by E.L.Sulman,H.F.K.Pickard,and John Ballot in 1906,19 years after the first cyanide process patents of MacArthur and the Forests.
