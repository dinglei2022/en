## Corrosion of Embedded Materials cement
Corrosion of embedded metals in concrete can be greatly reduced by placing crackfree concrete with low permeability and sufficient concrete cover.Lowpermeability concrete can be attained by decreasing the water to cementitious materials ratio of the concrete and the use of pozzolans and slag.Concrete degradation WikipediaConcrete degradation may have various causes.Concrete can be damaged by fire,aggregate expansion,sea water effects,bacterial corrosion,calcium leaching,physical damage and chemical damage (from carbonatation,chlorides,sulfates and nondistilled water).This process adversely affects concrete exposed to these damaging stimuli.

## TIP 13 Chloride Limits in Concrete
corrosion in the high pH (alkaline) environment when embedded in concrete.When chloride ions are present near reinforcing steel they override this passivation causing the initiation of the corrosion process.This is the more common cause of corrosion.Sources of chlorides can be external,such as from deicing chemicals andStrength appraisal of artificial sand as fine aggregate insand concrete (SFRNSC) and steel fiber reinforced artificial sand concrete (SFRASC) have been compared with the test data from the present study.The promotional use of artificial sand will conserve the natural resources for the sustainable development of the concrete in construction industry.

## Types and Causes of Concrete Deterioration cement
concrete,the passive corrosion rate is typically 0.1 &#181m per year.Without the passive film,the steel would corrode at rates at least 1,000 times higher (ACI 222 2001).Because of concrete's inherent protection,reinforcing steel does not corrode in the majority of concrete elements and structures.Corrosion Resistance of Stainless Steels in Soils and,Corrosion Resistance of Stainless Steels in Soils and,long term performance is a concern,is susceptible to corrosion and thus spalling of the concrete,Backfilling pipe ditches with sand offers quite good,long term protection in corrosive plastic clay soils
