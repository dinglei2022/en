## Improved mill control at Lihir Gold Mine in Papua New.
At the Lihir Gold Mine,the plant was utilizing mill’s bearing pressure to calculate load measurement for the SAG mill in HGO1.The use of SAG mill weight for process control is additionally complicated at Lihir by compromised and suddenly drifting load cell and bearing pressure measurements on two of the process plant’s three SAG mills.F Example Calculations FEMAgovF Example Calculations,=1,000 psf ; ultimate bearing pressure q u = 2,000 psf) Use ASCE 7 to calculate loads Foundation loads selected for this example of a manufactured home in an SFHA differ from,Hydrostatic Pressure (P h) P h = γH Specific Weight of Fresh Water.
