## Outfitting a Suction Dredging Project
All rocks that are larger than the intakesize of the dredge's suction nozzle must be moved out of the way by hand.When dredging in an average hardpacked streambed,at the point where an experienced operator gets down through 5feet of material using a 5inch dredge,he has so many rocks to get out of the dredge hole that he is lucky to2019 HPA Suction Dredge Rule Making Regulatory AnalysisClarifies that a suction dredge nozzle and hose are not allowed to be attached to combination equipment or stored on site when power sluice suction dredge combinations are being used as power sluices only.This prevents conversion to suction dredge mode when operating combination equipment under this section.
