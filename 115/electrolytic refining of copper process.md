## Electrolytic Copper Refining 2010 World Tankhouse survey
Electrolytic Copper Refining 2010 World Tankhouse survey.Isa Process and Kidd Process are now supplied by one source Xstrata technologies (XT)copper extraction and purification chemguideElectrolytic refining.The purification uses an electrolyte of copper(II) sulphate solution,impure copper anodes,and strips of high purity copper for the cathodes.The diagram shows a very simplified view of a cell.At the cathode,copper(II) ions are deposited as copper.At the anode,copper goes into solution as copper…
