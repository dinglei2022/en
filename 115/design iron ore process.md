## Iron Ore Mining Techniques,Metal Extraction,Types of
Iron ores are rocks and mineral deposits from which clanging iron can be reasonably extracted.Iron ore mining is classified into two egories manual mining and mechanized mining methods.Haematite and magnetite are the most commonly found iron ore minerals.Deposits of iron ore such as haematite containing iron oxide are found in sedimentary rocks from which the oxygen is removed from theIron Ore HowStuffWorksThe majority of Earth's iron,however,exists in iron ore.Mined right out of the ground,raw ore is mix of ore proper and loose earth called gangue.The ore proper can usually be separated by crushing the raw ore and simply washing away the lighter soil.

## What Is Iron Ore Beneficiation? (with pictures) wisegeek
Jun 30,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Iron ore beneficiation is a multistage process that raw iron ore undergoes to purify it prior to the process of smelting,which involves melting the ore to remove the metal content.The process of iron ore beneficiation has two complementary goals andsponge iron processJul 29,2010&nbsp&#0183&#32The Fe total content in sponge iron purely depends on Fe con tent in iron ore and the degree of reduction achieved in the process.Fe total content of 90%min is required for steel making requirement.Fe metallic: Fe metallic content in sponge iron depends on the effective control of process
