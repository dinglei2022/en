## Benefits Of Pelletized Lime
This substance is significantly more alkaline than any other form of limestone,including pelletized lime.It is produced by heating limestone in a special kiln,which burns carbon dioxide off of the limestone.This then converts the limestone with a molecular structure of CaCO3 to calcium oxide with a molecular structure of CaO.Cal 40x140 is used to stiffen molten glass in the glass manufacturing process.pulverized limestone.pulverized limestone mineral,ground calcium carbonate.

## Differences between Hydrated lime and quicklime Sodimate
The main differences between hydrated lime and quicklime are their reactivity & their chemical composition Hydrated lime and quicklime are both calcium compounds In its hydrated state,calcium is called calcium hydroxide,and in its pure state it is called calcium oxide,or quicklime Calcium oxide has a heavy density (65lb ft³) and is more reactive than hydrated limeLiming Acidified Lakes and Ponds VCE Publications.“Liming,” as the word suggests,is the addition of limestone (calcite),primarily calcium carbonate (CaCO3),to neutralize acid waters and soils and buffer them from rapid fluctuations in pH.Limestone typically is applied to lawns,gardens,pastures,and croplands to supply calcium,an essential plant nutrient,and to decrease soil acidity.
