## Calculate Ball Mill Grinding Capacity
4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The sizing of ball mills and ball milling circuits from laboratory grinding tests is largely a question of applying empirical equations or factors based on accumulated experience.Different manufacturers use different methods,and it is difficult to check the validity of the sizing estimates when estimates from different sources are widely divergent.It is especially difficult to teach mill.throughput cnkiAt an unchanged mill throughput,DY 1 # and DY 2 # grinding aids can raise the weight percent of 200 mesh fraction of the products by 7.8% for the primary ore and 4.6% for the mixed ore respectively.

## Iron Ore Crushing &amp; Grinding Controls
Grinding control circuitry is still based upon cyclone feed density controlling rod mill feed tonnage.This scheme permits the selective grinding of the low grade coarse fraction.This results in the advantage of obtaining either a coarser overall grind with the same grade and an increase in throughput,or a better grade at the same grind and throughput.Model Predictive Control for SAG Milling in MineralsThe solution automatically controls ore master feed rate and water addition to increase throughput,while keeping mill load within high and low constraints with a high hard limit AND while controlling slurry specific gravity.This promotes the correct ore bed and grinding conditions for the mill and for effective hydrocyclone classifiion.
