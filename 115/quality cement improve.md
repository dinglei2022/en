## The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete
The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete Concrete is a mixture of cementious material,aggregate,and water.Aggregate is commonly considered inert filler,which accounts for 60 to 80 percent of the volume and 70 to 85 percent of the weight of concrete.Properties of Concrete Workability,Setting,BleedingFresh concrete is that stage of concrete in which concrete can be moulded and it is in plastic state.This is also called &quotGreen Concrete&quot.Another term used to describe the state of fresh concrete is consistence,which is the ease with which concrete will flow.The transition process of changing of concrete from plastic state to hardened state.
