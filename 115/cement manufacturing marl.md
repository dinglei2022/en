## Process of Manufacturing of Cement Learning Technology
Jun 23,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Process of Manufacturing of Cement The cement is manufactured by integrating the calcareous component and argillaceous component in ratio of 3 : 1.The calcareous component can be limestone,chalk,marine shells,marl whereas argillaceous components can be shale,clay,blast furnace slag,slate.Cement Plants: Chalk Raw MaterialsThe softness of chalk made it a natural choice of raw material for the early cement industry,when cement manufacturing technology was primarily limited by lack of effective grinding techniques.The fine grinding of hard materials was initially at best expensive,and at worst impossible.

## RAW MATERIALS IN CEMENT PRODUCTION
Marl is a limestone with admixtures of silex and clay substances,as well as iron oxide.It is a transitional stage to clay.The hardness of marl is lower than the hardness of limestone The more clay substances,the lower its hardness.This is an excellent raw material for cement production.Each of these materials has different grinding.Environmental assessment of different cement manufacturingSep 01,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32Furthermore,from the table,it can be seen that the biggest contributor (∼44%) to the input Emergy of the overall cement manufacturing process comes from the high and low grade marl.This is due to their large input mass several orders of magnitude higher than of other input materials and relatively large unit emergy values.
