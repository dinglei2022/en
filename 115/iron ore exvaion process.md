## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview IntechOpen
The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years,owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries.However,the content of iron in ore deposits has deteriorated and lowgrade iron ore has been processed.The fines resulting from the concentration process must be agglomerated for use in iron and steelmaking.This chapter shows the status of the pelletizing processSteps in the Modern Steelmaking ProcessMay 16,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Methods for manufacturing steel have evolved significantly since industrial production began in the late 19th century.Modern methods,however,are still based on the same premise as the original Bessemer Process,which uses oxygen to lower the carbon content in iron.
