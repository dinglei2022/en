The three main feldspar minerals are potassium feldspar,(a.k.a.Kfeldspar or Kspar) and two types of plagioclase feldspar: albite (sodium only) and anorthite (calcium only).As is the case for iron and magnesium in olivine,there is a continuous range of compositions (solid solution series) between albite and anorthite in plagioclase.Myrmekite WikipediaMyrmekite describes a vermicular,or wormy,intergrowth of quartz in plagioclase.The intergrowths are microscopic in scale,typically with maximum dimensions less than 1 millimeter.The plagioclase is sodiumrich,usually albite or oligoclase.These quartzplagioclase intergrowths are associated with and commonly in contact with potassium feldspar.

## Orthoclase: Mineral information,data and localities.
Although petrologists had used twinning as a method of distinguishing orthoclase from microcline,Wright and Stewart (1958) used the difference in certain d values to calculate a degree of disorder of a sample and thus have a quantitative method to identify the structural state of a potassium feldspar.
