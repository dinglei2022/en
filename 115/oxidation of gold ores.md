## Pressure Oxidation Caldera Engineering
Pressure Oxidation (POX) is a process used to extract gold,copper,zinc,molybdenum,and uranium from refractory ore bodies.The POX process utilizesEffect of Pretreatment of Sulfide Refractory Concentrate.The majority of the refractory gold and silver occurs in occlusion in sulphides,then precious metal dissolution is possible by first oxidizing auriferous sulfide concentrate using sodium hypochlorite sodium hydroxide solution followed of pressure cyanidation of the oxidized concentrate,for the extraction of precious metals.
