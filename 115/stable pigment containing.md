## Biological pigment Wikipedia
Biological pigments,also known simply as pigments or biochromes,are substances produced by living organisms that have a color resulting from selective color absorption.Biological pigments include plant pigments and flower pigments.Many biological structures,such as skin,eyes,feathers,fur and hair contain pigments such as melanin in specialized cells called chromatophores.Pigments Present in Vegetables Your Article LibraryCarotene pigment is fat soluble and leaches out into the fat used to cook the item.This is why red grease floats to the surface of stews and meat soups which contain tomatoes or carrots.Pigment # 5.Betalains: The pigments in the root tissue of red beets are not chemically similar to anthocyanins they contain nitrogen and are called betalains.
