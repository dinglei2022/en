## molybdenum concentrate impurities
Flotation separates the metallic minerals from the gangue this way and in the case of copper molybdenum ores separates molybdenite from copper sulphide.The resulting MoS 2 concentrate contains between 85% and 92% MoS 2.Further treatment by acid leaching can be used to dissolve impurities like copper and lead if necessary.Read MorePreconcentration of Molybdenum from a Lowgrade PrimaryStudies on preconcentration of molybdenum values from a primary molybdenum ore deposit loed in Harur of Dharmapuri district,Tamilnadu were carried out by physical beneficiation techniques.Inspite of being a primary deposit,the Mo content in the ore is very low,being 0.06% only.Mo is present as molybdenite (MoS 2 ) and the other sulfide minerals in the ore are pyrite,galena and traces

## Using plants to clean contaminated soil Resilience
Aug 11,2014&nbsp&#0183&#32New article soon at In the last couple of centuries humans have done a strange thing: we've dug the biggest pits,the deepest holes,and the longest tunnels the world has ever seen,all to find the most insidious and subtle poisons known to our mammalian bodies,remove them from deep inside rocks where they had lain sequestered for eons,and concentrate them in the placesMolybdenum: mining and processingMetalpediaLarge rotary rakes move the molybdenite concentrate to promote the chemical reaction.Desulfurisation systems such as sulfuric acid plants or lime scrubbers remove sulfur dioxide from the effluent roaster gases.The resulting technical mo oxide typically contains a minimum of 57% molybdenum,and less than 0.1% sulfur.Upgrading

## PROCESS FOR THE REMOVAL OF LEAD FROM MOLYBDENITE
Dec 17,1974&nbsp&#0183&#32I claim 1.The process for reducing the lead content of molybdenite concentrate which comprises heating the concentrate at a temperature between about 150&#176450&#176 C for a period of about 1 2 to 3 hours with from about.530 percent by weight of ammonium chloride,and leaching the treated concentrate with hydrochloric or nitric acid to convert lead in the concentrate to a soluble lead
