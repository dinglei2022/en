## Lead smelting Wikipedia
Plants for the production of lead are generally referred to as lead smeltersPrimary lead production begins with sinteringConcentrated lead ore is fed into a sintering machine with iron,silica,limestone fluxes,coke,soda ash,pyrite,zinc,caustics or pollution control particulat Smelting uses suitable reducing substances that will combine with those oxidizing elements to free the metalHow Does Lead Affect Our Environment? The Green OptimisticJul 07,2020&#0183;&#32;Lead in the soil inhibits seed germination and seedling development It can interfere with root and plant growth,leading to stunted plants It tends to concentrate in the roots,but it will affect every aspect of the plant For example,lead absorption by a plant interferes with its ability to absorb magnesium and iron
