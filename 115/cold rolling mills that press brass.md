Cold rolling reduction is an important factor that affects drawability of IF steel.It has been observed that increasing cold rolling reduction increases the r m value,at least up to 90% [34].This effect has been shown in Fig.5.14.Perhaps the most important parameters in the production of a strong {111} recrystallization texture are the annealing temperature and the time of holding [35].Size Effect on Mechanical Properties and Texture of Pure Copper.16 May 2017.Keywords: size effect,ultimate strength,pure copper,cold rolling,surface grains.This meant that the size effect existed with a smaller T D.Uniaxial tensile was performed on the brass sheet with thickness in the range of 50 200 μm with.Illustration of (a) 3M asymmetric mill and (b) the control system.

## Difference Between Hot and Cold Rolled Steel Metal
Cold Rolled Steel.Cold rolled steel is essentially hot rolled steel that has had further processing.The steel is processed further in cold reduction mills,where the material is cooled (at room temperature) followed by annealing and or tempers rolling.Effect of Cold Rolling on Bending and Tensile Behavior ofThe present study reports the effect of cold working on bending and tensile behavior of 7075 Al alloy.A series of experiments involving cold rolling (58% cold work) have been conducted for the 7075O aluminum alloy.It has been shown that cold rolling has a significant effect on increasing the yield strength and decreasing ductility of alloy.
