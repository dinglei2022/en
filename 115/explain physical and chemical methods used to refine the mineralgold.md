## Refined coal Wikipedia
Refined coal is the product of the appliion of a coalupgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lowerrank coals such as subbituminous and lignite (brown) coals and raising their calorific values.Coal refining or upgrading technologies are typically precombustion treatments and or processes that alter the characteristics of a coal before it is burned.About Platinum Gold and silver minesIrrespective of the chemical separation processes used,the platinum metals are recovered in a finely divided metallic powder form.They can be converted to massive metal form by electronbeam melting.The lowermeltingpoint metals palladium and platinum can be fused by induction melting techniques.

## Chemical risks in mining industry prevor
The production of minerals involves a series of physical and chemical processes.These may occur at any time from excavation of the ore that contains the metal in mineral form through production of the metal in marketable form.Methods for physically separating the ore from surrounding material also include complex processes,such as leaching mixing the ore with chemical solutions or otherChemistry Elements,Compounds,and Mixtures QuizletDuring the refining process,the components of crude oil are separated.The main method used for separation is distillation,but some other methods are also used.After the components have been separated,they are tested for purity and then used in a variety of industries.Based on the information provided here,crude oil is:
