## Precious Metal Refining Process The Perth Mint
The electrolytic silver refining process is similar to gold,except that the silver anodes are dissolved in a bath of nitric acid.The resulting hodes are 99.9% pure silver.As with small gold bar production,these hodes are melted,granulated and cast into retail sized bars (most common being 100oz or kilo).Wohlwill process WikipediaThe Wohlwill process is an industrialscale chemical procedure used to refine gold to the highest degree of purity (99.999%).The process was invented in 1874 by Emil Wohlwill.This electrochemical process involves using a cast gold ingot,often called a Dor&#233 bar,of 95%+ gold to serve as an anode.

## Purifiion of Gold by Electrolysis
The Moebius Process of Purifiion of Gold by Electrolysis is now in successful operation and is said to be specially suitable for refining copper bullion containing large proportions of silver and gold with small quantities of lead,platinum,and other metals,but is chiefly used in parting dore silver containing not more than 20 per 1,000 of base metals.
