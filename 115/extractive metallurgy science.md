## Nonferrous extractive metallurgy Wikipedia
Nonferrous extractive metallurgy is one of the two branches of extractive metallurgy which pertains to the processes of reducing valuable,noniron metals from ores or raw material.Metals like zinc,copper,lead,aluminium as well as rare and noble metals are of particular interest in this field,while the more common metal,iron,is considered a major impurity.Graduate Diploma in Extractive Metallurgy OpenGraduate Diploma in Extractive Metallurgy.Hands on experience in the lab and in the field.An indepth study of mineral processing,pyrometallurgy,hydrometallurgy and process mineralogy,alongside engineering and plant design aspects.Find work as a metallurgist
