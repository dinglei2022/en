1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The growth of heap leaching is heavily tied to the massive scale on which mines are being built,with some sites requiring huge investments.Heap leach stacks can near 200m as operations look to more quickly prove and sustain site yield.Heap leaching accomplishes this—but only with the containment support of geosynthetics.Heap Leaching: Extending Appliions E &amp MJHowever,it is also important to remember that just 30 years ago,gold heap leaching was very much still at an early development stage: the 1985 edition of the SME's mineral processing handbook barely mentions it,with little more coverage given to heapleaching copper either.

## Heap Leaching
Heap leaching was initially applied to acid leaching of copper oxide ores and later extended to secondary sulfides and mixed oxide sulfide copper ores.By introducing bacterial activity and forced aeration to the heaps,an oxidative environment suitable for sulfide oxidation can be achieved.
