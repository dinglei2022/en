## Mining Facts for Kids
Fun Facts about Mining for Kids.One of the simplest types of mining is gold panning.Gold is heavier than river sand and sinks to the bottom if you rinse it with water.Shaft mining is very dangerous.Men dig a mine shaft vertically into the earth until they meet a seam a place rich in mineral deposits.Gold cyanidation WikipediaGold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthurForrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from lowgrade ore by converting the gold to a watersoluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction.

## The Mining Process Waihi Gold
A slurry of ground ore,water and a weak cyanide solution is fed into large steel leach tanks where the gold and silver are dissolved.Following this leaching process the slurry passes through six adsorption tanks containing carbon granules which adsorb the gold and silver.This process removes 93% of the gold and 70% of the silver.Major Mines &amp Projects Ahafo MineThe Ahafo mine is composed of three orogenic gold deposits that have oxide and primary mineralization.The gold is hosted in brittle shear zones cutting granitic intrusives that have kilometerscale vertical and lateral extent.Gold occurs primarily in pyrite and secondarily as native gold in quartz veins.
