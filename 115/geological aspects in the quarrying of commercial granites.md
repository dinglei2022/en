Quarrying is an important activity,providing both dressed building stones and aggregates for concrete.However,quarrying,which is an accelerated form of artificial erosion,dramatically changes the appearance of the landscape,both by producing ‘erosion scars’ (quarries),and by redistributing and ‘depositing’ vast quantities of,largely granitic,material.Granite WikipediaGranite has been extensively used as a dimension stone and as flooring tiles in public and commercial buildings and monuments Aberdeen in Scotland,which is constructed principally from local granite,is known as "The Granite City"
