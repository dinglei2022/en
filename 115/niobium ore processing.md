## Niobium Mining,Techniques,Mines,Occurence,Processing
MINING AND PROCESSING : The niobium ore is generally mined by the open pit method,where it is divided into blocks and processed by ripping,bulldozing,loading,and transporting.This openpit mining method is followed in Brazilian areas whereas in other niobium ore containing parts,the underground methods are followed.Process for recovering niobium and or tantalum compounds@article{osti 6455849,title = {Process for recovering niobium and or tantalum compounds from such ores further containing complexes of uranium,thorium,titanium and or rare earth metals},author = {Krismer,B.and Hoppe,A.},abstractNote = {A process for recovering one or more nonradioactive transition metal compounds from an ore containing

## Extraction of Niobium
The method of extraction of niobium and tantalum compounds from their natural ores does not differ from the process followed in the quantitative examination of the ores,and consists,briefly,in fusing the material with an alkali or alkali salt,extracting the fused mixture of niobates and tantalates with water,and hydrolysing the solution byHow Tantalum Is Mined SciencingApr 24,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32Most tantalum mines are open pit some are underground.The process of mining tantalum involves blasting,crushing and transporting the resulting ore to begin the process of freeing the tantalum.The ore is then concentrated at or near the mine site,to increase the percentage (by weight) of tantalum oxide and niobium.
