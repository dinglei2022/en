## NRC: Uranium Enrichment
The gaseous diffusion process uses molecular diffusion to separate a gas from a two gas mixture The isotopic separation is accomplished by diffusing uranium [which has been combined with fluorine to form uranium hexafluoride (UF 6) gas] through a porous membrane (barrier),and using the different molecular velocities of the two isotopes to achieve separationComplex Fluids Open Access Articles Digital …Open access academic research from top universities on the subject of Complex Fluids.to separate waste.and the waste that enables the separation.
