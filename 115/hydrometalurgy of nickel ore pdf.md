## Hydrometallurgy an overview ScienceDirect Topics
In hydrometallurgy,two types of oxides are important: binary oxides which contain only one metal,and complex oxides,containing several metals.Both types have mostly an ion structure and the metal atoms are characterised by high coordination numbers,often 6 or 8.The most important structures of the binary oxides,considered in hydrometallurgy,are presented in Table 2.1.Pressure Acid Leaching of Nickel Laterites: A Review,Pressure Acid Leaching of Nickel Laterites: A Review,PDF Citations,Atmospheric acid leaching mechanisms and kinetics and rheological studies of a low grade saprolitic nickel laterite ore Hydrometallurgy 160,pages 26 37 Crossref Nevill Matson Rice (2016) A hydrochloric acid process for nickeliferous laterit

## Nickel mining in New Caledonia Wikipedia
Nickel mining in New Caledonia is a major sector of the New Caledonian economy.The islands contain about 7,100,000 tonnes of nickel which is about 10% of the world's nickel reserves [citation needed].With the annual production of about 107,000 tonnes in 2009,New Caledonia was the world's fifth largest producer after Russia (266,000),Indonesia (189,000),Canada (181,000) and Australia (167,000).Hydrometallurgical process for the separation and,Hydrometallurgical process for the separation and recovery of nickel from sulphate heap leach liquor of nickeliferrous laterite or,D,2001 Method for obtaining nickel and cobalt from oxidised nickel and cobalt ore by extraction in heaps using dilute sulphuric acid prepared by using sea water,at ambient temperature,Hydrometallurgy.
