## Granulation techniques and technologies: recent progresses
Feb 18,2015&nbsp&#0183&#32Granulation,the process of particle enlargement by agglomeration technique,is one of the most significant unit operations in the production of pharmaceutical dosage forms,mostly tablets and capsules.Granulation process transforms fine powders into freeflowing,dustfree granules that are easy to compress.A GUIDEBOOK TO PARTICLE SIZE ANALYSIS HoribaMany techniques make the general assumption that every particle is a sphere and report the value of some equivalent diameter.Microscopy or automated image analysis are the only techniques that can describe particle size using multiple values for particles with larger aspect ratios.2

## Particlesize distribution Wikipedia
The particlesize distribution (PSD) of a powder,or granular material,or particles dispersed in fluid,is a list of values or a mathematical function that defines the relative amount,typically by mass,of particles present according to size.Significant energy is usually required to disintegrate soil,etc.particles into the PSD that is then called a grain size distribution.Drug Solubility: Importance and Enhancement TechniquesJul 05,2012&nbsp&#0183&#322.Importance of Solubility.Oral ingestion is the most convenient and commonly employed route of drug delivery due to its ease of administration,high patient compliance,costeffectiveness,least sterility constraints,and flexibility in the design of dosage form.
