## What is the difference between continuous and uniformly
Continuity at a particular point [math]P[ math] is like a game: someone challenges you to stay within a given target precision,you respond by finding a small region around [math]P[ math] within which the function doesn't wiggle outside that precigotoif.org Inquiry Facilitators Enhancing …updated: 7 26 2017 IF is proud to announce our partnership with SIPI’s TCU ATMS Summer Institute 2017.If,Inc.staff,Thomas Grzybowski and Miguel Maestas,will be.
