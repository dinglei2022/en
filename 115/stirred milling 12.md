## US20090084874A1 Method of producing nanoparticles and
The field of invention is related to a method of producing nanoparticles of less than 100 nm using a stirred media mill and a novel stirred media mill for producing the nanoparticles.The dead zones present in the stirred media mill,are the main cause of long time grinding and wide size distribution of product and is rectified in our design by optimum design of stirrer which will transfer theScaleup and operations of a vertical stirred mill UBCThis thesis addresses both of these issues and therefore supports commercial appliions of this vertical stirred mill.Stirred media mills are influenced by a great number of operating variables.A study was conducted to understand the influence of mill speed,feed particle size and,slurry density and rheology on the VXPmill performance.
