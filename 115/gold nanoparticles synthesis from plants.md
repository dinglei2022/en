## RESEARCH Open Access Optimization and stabilization of
Stabilization of gold nanoparticles using phytosynthesis and microwave heating techniques is an emerging area in the field of advanced nanoparticles synthesis.Several plants and plant products have been successfully used for efficient and rapid extracellular synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles.Leaf extracts of Coleus aromaticusGreen Synthesis and Characterization of Gold NanoparticlesIn the present research program,cost effective and environment friendly gold nanoparticless were synthesized using the onion (Allium cepa) extract as the reducing agent.The nanoparticless were characterized using UVvisble,XRD,and SEM,TEM methods.The absorption peak at 540 nm was found to be broaden with increase in time indiing the polydispersity nature of the nanoparticles.
