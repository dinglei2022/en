## Determination of the true density of pulverized coal samples
A method using the gascomparison pycnometer with helium gas as the penetrating medium measures precisely the true volume of a pulverized coal sample.The true density of a solid is calculated as the true unit volume of the solid exclusive of its pore space which is divided into the weight of the sample.The method is similar to that used to determine the density of refractory materials butRepresentative Sample Preparation for XRF AnalysisJul 03,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32RETSCH offers a wide range of instruments for sample preparation during the complete production process.Typically,a sample preparation process will involve preliminary size reduction,sample division,fine size reduction and,depending on the subsequent analysis,pellet pressing.To produce a homogeneous and representative pulverized
