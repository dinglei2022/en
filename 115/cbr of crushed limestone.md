CBR is not a fundamental material property and thus is unsuitable for direct use in mechanistic and mechanistic empirical design procedures.However,it is a relatively easy and inexpensive test to perform,it has a long history in pavement design,and it is reasonably well correlated with more fundamental properties like resilient modulus.Evaluation of the Base Subgrade Soil under Repeated2010813&ensp&#0183&enspEvaluation of the Base Subgrade Soil under Repeated Loading: Phase 1 Laboratory Testing and Numerical Geogrid reinforcement,Crushed limestone,Base coarse layer,Triaxial test,Resilient modulus,Permanent deformation,Finite element analysis,Statistical analysis.geogrid modulus,and subgrade CBR value.The findings

## Can the CBR value of soil be 100%? Quora
Yes,CBR can be greater than 100% for stabilized soil (soilcement mixes) and as well as for extremely well graded aggregates.This is because CBR is a strength index,not a strength value What is the relation between the CBR and the SBC of soilFLEXIBLE BASE 247.1.247.2.A.Aggregate.Table 1 Material …c.Type C.Crushed gravel with a minimum of 60% of the particles retained on a No.4 sieve with 2 or more crushed faces as determined by Tex A,Part I.Blending of 2 or more sources is allowed.d.Type D.Type A material or crushed concrete.Crushed
