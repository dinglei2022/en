## Separation energy Wikipedia
Electron separation energy or electron binding energy,the energy required to remove one electron from a neutral atom or molecule (or ion) is called ionization energy.The reaction leads to photoionization,photodissociation,the photoelectric effect,photovoltaics,etc.Photoelectric effect WikipediaThe photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons or other free carriers when light hits a material.Electrons emitted in this manner can be called photoelectrons.This phenomenon is commonly studied in electronic physics,as well as in fields of chemistry,such as quantum chemistry and electrochemistry.During the years 18861902,Wilhelm Hallwachs and Philipp Lenard investigated the
