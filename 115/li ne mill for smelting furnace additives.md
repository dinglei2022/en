## Types of Metal Melting Furnaces Bizfluent
These furnaces are often used in steel mills as well as foundries.Metal and additives are poured into the furnace.The additives help to separate the impurities present in the metal.The furnace melts the metal through the use of granite or carbon electrodes which create an electric arc.Gas Metal Gold Smelting &amp Melting Furnaces 911MetallurgistGas Metal Gold Smelting &amp Melting Furnaces The first product was a microwave kiln that was quickly followed with the creation of the KK4 which is called the Kwik Kiln.The KK4 kit comes complete,minus propane and something to smelt,of course.

## Iron Ore Smelting Process Brighthub Engineering
Iron Ore Smelting Process Using Modern Blast Furnaces.Although the basic ingredients of an iron ore blast furnace has changed little over the last hundred years or so,the furnaces themselves have been modernized to improve efficiency and the purity of the iron and steel.What material is used to hold molten iron in a furnace?What material is used to hold molten iron in a furnace? Ask Question 15.1 In iron smelting (from ore) these furnaces would normally be tapped straight into sand ingot moulds producing 'pig iron' which would either be remelted into cast iron components or further processed to produce wrought iron or steel.
