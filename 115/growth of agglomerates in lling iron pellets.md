## Iron Ore Agglomeration Processes and their Historical
Dec 28,2015&nbsp&#0183&#32Pelletizing of iron ore is a method of Swedish origin,patented in 1912 by AG Andersson (Yamaguchi et al.2010).The process was developed in the USA in the 1940s,and the first commercial plant started operation in Babbitt,Minnesota in 1952.The first iron ore pellet plant of the gratekiln type was established at Humboldt Mine,Michigan in(PDF) Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overviewis a fundamental factor in the formation and growth of pellets,which creates a surface tension not considered to belong to the population of agglomerates The binder mainly used for iron
