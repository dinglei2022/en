## Richter magnitude scale Wikipedia
Minor earthquakes occur every day and hour.On the other hand,great earthquakes occur once a year,on average.The largest recorded earthquake was the Great Chilean earthquake of May 22,1960,which had a magnitude of 9.5 on the moment magnitude scale.The larger the magnitude,the less frequently the earthquake happens.Earthquake Magnitude TNT Equivalent TableThe 'kiloton (of TNT)' is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 terajoules.The 'megaton (of TNT)' is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 petajoules.As given in the above Earthquake Magnitude TNT Equivalent Table,1 Richter scale is equal to 0.005 tons of TNT explosion and 10 richter scale is equal to 15.0802424589 x 10^9 tons of TNT explosion.

When an earthquake occurs there is a sudden release of energy in the form of waves,called seismic waves.There are two main types of seismic waves: body waves,which can travel through the inner layers of the earth,and surface waves,which can only travel on the surface.Body waves are the fastest and have the highest frequency.The first type of body wave is called the primary or Pwave.Shaking table test on earthquakedamagedThe earthquake investigation shows that masonry buildings are prone to severe damage or even collapse due to their seismic vulnerability.BFRP has excellent physical and mechanical properties as well as the advantage of low cost,but it has not yet been widely
