## Water adsorption on carbon A review ScienceDirect
A common feature of water adsorption on carbonaceous solids,whether they are porous or not,is the existence of a hysteresis loop.Pierce and Smith proposed that water first adsorbs on strong sites on the carbon surface,followed by formation,growth and coalescence of clusters due to the strong hydrogen bonding between water molecules and the OFGs.Adsorption Introduction of activated carbon KurarayAdsorption.Adsorption is a surface phenomenon.Molecules in a fluid (gas or liquid) are adsorbed by the attractive force (Van der Waals force) of the surface of the solid body (activated carbon) to cause adsorption.
