## Aluminium alloy Wikipedia
Aluminium alloys (or aluminum alloys see spelling differences) are alloys in which aluminium (Al) is the predominant metal.The typical alloying elements are copper,magnesium,manganese,silicon,tin and zinc.There are two principal classifiions,namely casting alloys and wrought alloys,both of which are further subdivided into the egories heattreatable and nonheattreatable.Aluminum Alloy Frame My Time at Portia Wiki FANDOMAluminum Alloy Frame is an assembled item used a mission and some commissions.Aluminum Alloy Frame can be crafted using the Assembly Station after obtaining the diagram in a letter from Dana during her mining company mission.

## Precipitation Hardening of Aluminum Alloys :: Total
Many aluminum based alloys,coppertin,certain steels,nickel based superalloys and titanium alloys can be strengthened by age hardening processes.In order for an alloy system to be able to be precipitationstrengthened,there must be a terminal solid solution that has a decreasing solid solubility as the temperature decreases.Aluminium WikipediaPure aluminum is quite soft and lacking in strength.In most appliions various aluminium alloys are used instead because of their higher strength and hardness.The yield strength of pure aluminium is 7 11 MPa,while aluminium alloys have yield strengths ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa.
