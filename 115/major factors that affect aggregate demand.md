## Aggregate Supply (AS) Curve CliffsNotes Study Guides
Like changes in aggregate demand,changes in aggregate supply are not caused by changes in the price level.Instead,they are primarily caused by changes in two other factors.The first of these is a change in input prices.For example,the price of oil,an input good,increased dramatically in the 1970s due to efforts by oil‐exportingAggregate demand WikipediaThe aggregate demand curve illustrates the relationship between two factors: the quantity of output that is demanded and the aggregate price level.Aggregate demand is expressed contingent upon a fixed level of the nominal money supply.There are many factors that can shift the AD curve.
