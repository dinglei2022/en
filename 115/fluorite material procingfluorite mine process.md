## Fluorite Wikipedia
Fluorite is a widely occurring mineral that occurs globally with significant deposits in over 9,000 areas.It may occur as a vein deposit,especially with metallic minerals,where it often forms a part of the gangue (the surrounding &quothostrock&quot in which valuable minerals occur) and may be associated with galena,sphalerite,barite,quartz,and calcite.Fluorspar (Calcium Fluoride) Powder (CaF2) ReadeFluorite or Fluorspar is a mineral composed of calcium fluoride (CaF2),the principal fluorinebearing mineral.It occurs as cubic,isometric crystals and cleavable masses.When pure,it is colorless and transparent,or translucent with a glassy luster.Impurities cause color in the stone,and several varieties exhibit fluorescence.
