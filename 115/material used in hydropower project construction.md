## Dams Civil Engineering Dams Construction,Types and
Civil Engineering Dams A dam is a barrier that impounds water or underground streams.Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation,human consumption,industrial use,aquaculture,and navigability.Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity.Construction Bulletins Site CBC Hydro is collecting your name and email address in order to send you email updates about the project and or construction bulletins on the Site C Project.This personal information will be used only for the purpose of sending you news and information about the project and or construction activities.
