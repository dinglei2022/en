## Project Azorian Wikipedia
Project Azorian (erroneously called &quotJennifer&quot by the press after its Top Secret Security Compartment) was a U.S.Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) project to recover the sunken Soviet submarine K129 from the Pacific Ocean floor in 1974,using the purposebuilt ship Hughes Glomar Explorer.equiptment used in mining manganese oreFor the manganese nodule areas this means that contractors apply to the ISA can only use half of their licence area,or a maximum of 75,000 square kilometres.The mining techniques to be used in the future to harvest nodules have still not time periods because repairs on deepsea equipment are extremely costly,

## Manganese Nodules an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Deep sea polymetallic manganese nodules contain a high proportion of manganese oxide which are a generally strong oxidation agent.Therefore,in addition to other appliions,investigations were also carried out to determine the use of these nodules as a possible oxidation agent in leaching of sulphides [122,123] in a solution of HCl with different concentrations at different temperatures.HSES 1eTE C14.qxd 5 16 04 1:00 PM Page 410 Section 14.4 14Manganese NodulesAs described earlier,manganese nodules are hard lumps of manganese and other metals that precipitate around a smaller object.Figure 15 shows manganese nodules on the deepocean ï¬‚oor.They contain high concentrations of manganese,iron,and smaller concentrations of copper,Evaporative Salts 4.

In the CCZ,polymetallic nodules cover 9 million km 2 with typical concentrations of 15 kg m2.The nodules contain nickel,copper,and cobalt (around 2 3% of the nodule weight) as well as traces of other metals such as molybdenum,Rare Earth Elements andLeaching of Manganese from Marine Nodules at RoomIn order to extract manganese and other metals from marine nodules,the use of a reducing agent is necessary [].Acid leaching of marine nodules,with the use of iron as a reducing agent,has shown good results [8,9,10].In a previous study carried out by Toro et al.[],several parameters were evaluated for dissolving Mn from marine nodules using slag at room temperature in an acid medium.
