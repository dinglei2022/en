## Lithium recovery from lepidolite roasted with potassium,
Abstract Three different potassium compounds,namely K2SO4,KOH,and K2SO4 + KOH,were used as additives to extract lithium from lepidolite by roasting and water leaching The effect of the additive ore mass ratio on the extraction of Li,K,Si,and Al was compared among the different additiv Efficient extraction of Li and K was obtained by roasting lepidolite with the K2SO4 and K2SO4 + KOH.
