## Production of brown and black pigments by using flotation,
One of the major problems in copper producing countries is the treatment of the large amount of copper slag or copper flotation waste generated from copper slag which contains significant amounts of heavy metals such as Cu,Zn,Pb and Co Dumping or disposal of such large quantities of flotation waste from copper slag causes environmental and space problemsWales The birthplace of Flotation Maelgwyn Mineral,The flotation process was invented by Frank Elmore who worked on the development with his brother,Stanley The Glasdir copper mine was bought in 1896 by the Elmore brothers in conjunction with their father,William Elmore

## Empirical Evaluation of Factors Affecting Froth Stability
The experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that in porphyry copper flotation the grinding environment influences surfaces oxidation,pyrite activation and the extent of hydrophobic particles reporting to the froth phase.This has an indirect effect on the resulting froth stability,which is however small if compared to the other factors.Estimated Water Requirements for the Conventional,produced by flotation (International Copper Study Group,2012) In 2011,about 60 percent of primary copper produced in the United States originated from flotation (Daniel E Edelstein,Copper Commodity Specialist,US Geological Survey,written commun,March 20,2012)
