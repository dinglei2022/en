## Copper Ore Hydrometallurgy and Pressure LeachingCopper
Copper hydrometallurgy is a branch of metallurgy method to extract copper directly from those difficulttoconcentrate copper oxide ore.Traditional copper hydrometallurgy process typically consists of atmospheric leaching,solvent extraction (SX) and electrowinning (EW).HEAP LEACHING TECHNIQUE in MINING EurominesHeap leaching is BAT for suitable ores because it allows the economical processing of ore that would otherwise be uneconomic under con ditions that can technically achieve regulatory acceptable levels of environmental risk mitigation.All of the materials used in heap leaching process and industry specifiions of materials are

A method of leaching copper from copper sulphidecontaining concentrates,such as chalcopyrite,includes using pyrite as a alyst for ferric reduction in order to eliminate passivation of the chalcopyrite surface,the process being carried out under conditions whereby the pyrite is not materially oxidized,for example by maintaining the operating solution potential at a suitable level.Evaluation of copper leaching in thermally modifiedBut in fact,the copper leaching process is not the same as copper ions diffusion.Copper ions could be chemically reacted with wood or physically attached to wood by ionion or dipoledipole interactions (Craciun et al.2009).These circumstances suggest limited ability of the copper
