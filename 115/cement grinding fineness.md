29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Grinding aids for high performance cements Grinding aids are organic compounds that are added to the mill during cement grinding.Their main purpose is to reduce the energy required to grind the clinker into a given fineness.In addition,some products (usually referred to as performance enhancers) provide positive effect on cement hydration.Prediction of raw meal fineness in the grinding process of …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Raw meal fineness is the percentage content of 80 &#181;m sieving residue after the cement raw material is ground.The accurate prediction of raw meal fineness in the vertical mill system is very helpful for the operator to control the vertical mill.

## FINENESS OF CEMENT BY DRY SIEVING (IS: Part …
Fineness of cement increases the rate of evolution of heat.Finer cement offers a great surface area for hydration and hence faster the development of strength.Increase in fineness of cement also increases the drying shrinkage of concrete and hence creates cracks in structures.Excessive fineness requirement increases cost of grinding.Fineness of CementThe required fineness of good cement is achieved through grinding the clinker in the last step of cement production process.As hydration rate of cement is directly related to the cement particle size,fineness of cement is very important.Importance of Cement Fineness The fineness of cement affects hydration rate,and in turn,the strength.
