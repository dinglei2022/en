## STRONTIANITE (Strontium Carbonate)
Strontianite is a rare carbonate mineral and one of only a few strontium minerals.Crystals are rarer than the massive forms,and so are usually sold as specimens.Typical specimens have spiky,minute crystals in radiating aggregates or tufts.However,it also forms pseudohexagonal twins similar to aragonite's famous twin.It was mined for aStrontium: Uses,Side Effects,Interactions,Dosage,andOverview Information Strontium is a silvery metal found naturally as a nonradioactive element.About 99% of the strontium in the human body is concentrated in the bones.
