THE STIBNITE GOLD PROJECT The Stibnite Gold Project is unlike any other mining project.Midas Gold loed a worldclass deposit of gold and antimony in an area in need of serious environmental repair.We have the opportunity to take an area damaged by 100 years of mining activity and improve the environment including water quality,wildlife habitat,fisheriesNatural stibnite ore (Sb2S3) embedded in sulfurdopedTo incorporate green chemistry,natural stibnite ore (Sb 2 S 3) after modifiion via carbon sheets was applied as a firsthand material in SIBs through a facile and efficient strategy.The unique composites exhibited an outstanding electrochemical performance with a higher reversible capacity,a better rate capability,as well as an excellent

## Antimony Leaching from Stibnite and Complex Ores International.
Abstract.To shed light on the leaching of Sb from mine wastes containing stibnite,two series of experiments were conducted.In one experiment,polished slabs of a museum grade stibnite and a mixed sulfide ore sample containing 28% Sb were subjected to accelerated weathering at 100% humidity and 31 35oC for 37 44&nbsp;.Stibnite WikipediaStibnite,sometimes called antimonite,is a sulfide mineral with the formula Sb2S3.This soft grey material crystallizes in an orthorhombic space group.It is the most important source for the metalloid antimony.The name is from the Greek στίβι stibi through the Latin stibium as the old name for the mineral and the element&nbsp;.
