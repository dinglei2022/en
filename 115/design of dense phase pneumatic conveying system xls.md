## Considerations When Designing a Pneumatic Transfer System,
21 11 2017&#0183;&#32;Dilute Phase Conveying or Dense Phase Conveying A third major consideration in pneumatic conveying is the choice of whether to design for a dilute phase system or a dense phase system Pneumatic conveying is about moving dry bulk materials with air You can move a lot of things with air velocity and powerDense Phase Conveying Pneumatic ConveyorsIn particular,dense phase conveying deals with the transportation of abrasive,friable or heavy materials such as sands,soils,minerals,food,paper scraps,and rocks.Dense phase conveyors push materials through at a fairly low velocity with a low airtomaterial ratio.

## DILUTE vs DENSE PHASE Magnum Systems Inc
Pneumatic conveying has two distinct methods,Dilute Phase and Dense Phase.Knowing when to apply each method typically involves product testing and a wellexperienced individual.Not all materials are alike and not all materials move the same way when transferred through piping.What is dilute phase and dense phase conveyingDense Phase Pneumatic Conveying System & Design Nol TecDense phase pneumatic conveying is a method for moving difficult,abrasive,mixed batch,or friable materials at a low product velocity Gentler Way To Convey Our system incorporates low gas volume at high pressure,conveying materials through an enclosed pipe in slug form at a,
