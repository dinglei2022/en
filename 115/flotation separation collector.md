## A Flotation Collector for the Separation of Unburned
ABSTRACT A very good separation of unburned carbon from fly ash was achieved with a laboratory flotation machine by employing a mixture of 4dodecylphenol (DDP) and hexadecane (HXD) as a collector.No other reagent was required.Good results were obtained by recleaning either the concentrate or the tailings in twostage flotation tests.Flotation separation of scheelite from calcite using mixedThe results show that sodium oleate has collecting ability to both scheelite and calcite and the flotation separation of scheelite from calcite cannot be realized if collector is used only.
