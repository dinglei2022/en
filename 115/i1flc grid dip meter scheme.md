OF COURSE the grid dip meter is a valuable tool I wouldn't be without one There is a certain technique involved and a bit of knowledge 1 The dip is sharpest and deepest if the circuit is unloaded by any resistive components In this sense,a low Q ferrite can act as a parallel resistor and may completely obscure the dip 2 Tune slowly 3The Magazine Rack archiveorg73 Magazine January 1992 (#376) The Dual Combo Field Strength and Source Dip Meter Versatile test instruments for all your RF projects,WB0ESV 8 Safety Power Breaker for the Test Bench Avoid a shocking experience.

We integrated an instrument into DipIt which was an absolutely “MUST HAVE” for long times but has been nearly forgotten the last years: the Direct Conversion Frequency Meter or Zero beat Frequency Meter because it extreme useful to have it when building Amateur Radio Kits without access to other frequency selective metering devices like.New Circuits Page 168 :: Next.grNew Circuits Page 168 Page 168 Adjustable Regulator by TL431.fitting a circuit scheme to a simpler mode.Grid DIP Meter.This circuit was developed by Luigi Falcone,I1FLC.He uses seven plug in coils covering 3.0 to 30Mhz in a Colpitts oscillator circuit.The coaxial socket J2 permits connection to a frequency meter when required.
