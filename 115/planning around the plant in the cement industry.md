Demand for cement in the construction industry drives production,and thus it is an important determinant of cement subsector energy consumption and CO 2 emissions.Initial estimates suggest that cement production returned to 4.1 gigatonnes (Gt) globally in 2018,a 1% increase following annual declines of 1% during 2014‑17.Environmental Impact Assessment and Management Planthe legacy of the old cement plant at Otjiwarongo,which had a poor record of environmental management especially in relation to air quality and dust emitted from the plant.This influenced many people's perceptions who did not have experience of a modern cement plant.The Scoping Report was compiled in response to a number of inputs:

Cement production accounts for around 7% of total global industrial energyuse and about 7% of global emissions.Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of a chemical conversion process used in the production of clinker,a component of cement,in which limestone (CaCO 3) is converted to lime (CaO).Sources of greenhouse gas emissions in a typical cementENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF CEMENT PRODUCTIONcement industry has been using large quantities of waste fuels or biomass fuels,for more than 15 years.The production of cement involves the consumption of large quantities of raw materials,energy,and heat.Cement production also results in the release of a significant amount of solid waste materials and gaseous emissions.
