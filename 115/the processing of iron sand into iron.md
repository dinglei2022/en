## Ironsand Wikipedia
Ironsand also known as ironsand and iron sand is a type of sand with heavy concentrations of iron.It is typically dark grey or blackish in colour.It is composed mainly of magnetite,Fe 3 O 4,and also contains small amounts of titanium,silica,manganese,calcium and vanadium.Ironsand has a tendency to heat up in direct sunlight,causing temperatures high enough to cause minor burns.Steps in the Modern Steelmaking ProcessMay 16,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Methods for manufacturing steel have evolved significantly since industrial production began in the late 19th century.Modern methods,however,are still based on the same premise as the original Bessemer Process,which uses oxygen to lower the carbon content in iron.
