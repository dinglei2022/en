## Rubidium82 Wikipedia
Rubidium82 (82 Rb) is a radioactive isotope of rubidium.82 Rb is widely used in myocardial perfusion imaging.This isotope undergoes rapid uptake by myocardiocytes,which makes it a valuable tool for identifying myocardial ischemia in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging.82 Rb is used in the pharmaceutical industry and is marketed under the trade names RUBYFILL Rubidium Rb82Rubidium (Rb) AMERICAN ELEMENTSNatural rubidium is composed of one stable isotope (85 Rb) and one radioactive isotope (87 Rb) in a 72.2 to 27.8 ratio because 87 Rb decays to 87 Sr with a halflife of 49 billion years (close to 3 times the estimated age of the universe),the mechanism serves as the basis for a rock and mineral dating method.
