Some limestones form from the cementation of sand and or mud by calcite ( clastic limestone),and these often have the appearance of sandstone or mudstone.As calcite is the principle mineral component of limestone,it will fizz in dilute hydrochloric acid.Dolomite (Mineral) an overview ScienceDirect TopicsDolomite (also called magnesian limestone) is named after the mineral dolomite CaMg(CO 3) 2 that it contains.It is formed from limestone by chemical reactions during diagenesis.Dolomitic rocks are classified according to their percentage content of the dolomite mineral as follows: • 0 10% dolomite = limestone.• 10 50% dolomite

## The composition of limestone What is limestone
Limestone is a sedimentary rock,most of which originally formed by the accumulation of sediments on the sea floor (although some formed in fresh water).These sediments,which were afterwards turned to limestone rock,are composed of over 50 per cent carbonate minerals.There are three main components in limestone: calcite and aragonite dolomiteDolomite Ohio History CentralDolomite differs from calcite,the main component of limestone,because it contains the element magnesium (Mg) as well as calcium (Ca).The chemical industry uses the mineral dolomite in making magnesium salts including magnesia,which is used in medicine.Builders use the rock dolomite as both structural and ornamental stone.
