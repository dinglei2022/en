## Coke Production For Blast Furnace Ironmaking steel
A world class blast furnace operation demands the highest quality of raw materials,operation,and operators.Coke is the most important raw material fed into the blast furnace in terms of its effect on blast furnace operation and hot metal quality.A high quality coke should be able to support aBlast furnace WikipediaThe blast furnaces used in the Imperial Smelting Process ("ISP") were developed from the standard lead blast furnace,but are fully sealed This is because the zinc produced by these furnaces is recovered as metal from the vapor phase,and the presence of oxygen in the off gas would result in the formation of zinc oxide
