## Comminution Wikipedia
Comminution is the reduction of solid materials from one average particle size to a smaller average particle size,by crushing,grinding,cutting,vibrating,or other processes.In geology,it occurs naturally during faulting in the upper part of the Earth's crust.Investigating of the effect of ore work index and particleInvestigating of the effect of ore work index and particle size on the grinding modeling of some copper sulphide ores P80,sieve opening at which 80% of the product passes (μm) F80,sieve opening at which 80% of the feed passes (μm).The calculated Bond work indexes of samples were 12,13.7 and 15.4 obtained from Bond grindability test
