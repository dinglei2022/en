## Estimation of Cement,Sand,and Gravel in Construction
In the estimation of cement,sand,and gravel volumes for concrete proportioning,we use the Fuller's Formula.This is an easy way to get a rough estimate in case you are in the field.FULLER'S FORMULA.Let: C = number of bags of cement per cubic meter of concrete work (bag m 3) S = volume of sand per cubic meter of concrete work (m 3 of sand1 cubic meter of cement is equal to how many bags?Cement comes in bags that weigh 94 lbs.The volume of the bag is approximately 1 cubic foot.If you want to mix concrete which is a mixture of a coarse aggregate (gravel) and a fine aggregate
