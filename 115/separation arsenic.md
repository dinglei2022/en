## Treatment Technologies For Arsenic Removal EPA
Treatment Technologies for Arsenic Removal On January 18,2001,the United States Environmental Protection Aagency (EPA) finalized the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for arsenic at 0.01 mg L.Separation and recovery of arsenic from arsenicbearingThe arsenicbearing dust is one of the most important secondary resources,which contains a large amount of valuable metals,such as lead,antimony and indium.Therefore,separating arsenic from arsenicbearing dust to reclaim valuable metals is of great environmental and economic meanings.

## Arsenic Speciation in Human Organs following Fatal Arsenic
The aim of this investigation was to study the distribution of arsenic species in human organs following fatal acute intoxiion by arsenic trioxide.The collected autopsy samples of most organs were ground and dried,and the total arsenic was measured by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS).The arsenic species—inorganic arsenic,in the form of arsenite [As(III)] andExtraction of arsenate and arsenite species from soils andThe primary objective of this study was to develop a simple method that can be used to extract the more readily mobilizable and bioavailable arsenic species from soil and sediment while at the same time minimizing the transformation between (As III) and (As V),the two most commonly found arsenic species in the environment.Several extraction strategies were evaluated using phosphate as

## Arsenic Toxicity Case Study: Where is Arsenic Found
Oct 01,2009&nbsp&#0183&#32Arsenic occurs naturally in the earth's crust,and much of its dispersion in the environment stems from mining and commercial uses.In industry,arsenic is a byproduct of the smelting process (separation of metal from rock) for many metal ores such as.cobalt,gold,lead,nickel,and zinc.Field separationbased speciation analysis of inorganicIn order to prevent interconversion of arsenic species in the samples,a simple field separation method was applied by using solid phase extraction anion exchange cartridges prior to the inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometric analyses.
