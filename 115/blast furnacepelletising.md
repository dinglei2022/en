A blast furnace (BF) is a type of metallurgical furnace used to produce industrial metals,generally,pig iron (aka hot metal),an intermediate product in conventional,coal based steelmaking A blast furnace (BF) is used to smelt iron from iron ore Blast furnaces produce pig iron (aka hot metal) by reducing carbon (coke from coking coal) in the presence of a fluxing agent like limestonesintering vs pelletizing iron ore parkhurstprimaryiron ore pellets versus sinter in blast furnace.Iron ore pelletizing Iron ore fines are agglomerated into pellets and then indurated using a furnace to create iron ore pellets These are iron ore sinter vs pellets.Chat Online iron ore sinter vs pellets Grinding Mill China.iron ore sinter vs pellets

Iron ores are coalesced into pellets or sinter for the blast furnace.Pelletizing involves iron ore fines being formed into balls using binders and fired in a shaft or rotary kiln.In strand sintering plants,the fines are agglomerated into irregular ore nodules using binders and flux.The Iron Pelletizing Process: Part One :: Total Materia,The pelletizing process is a process which contains numerous sub processes,or process segments On the way from the mine to a final product,the iron ore goes through the following main process segments: 1) The iron ore is crushed and the waste rock is removed About 85 % of the particles should be less than 44 μm (in length,width,or height)
