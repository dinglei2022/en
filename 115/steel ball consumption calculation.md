## Predicting Steel Media Consumption Grinding
A big majority of people is still using the old Bond equations without asking themselves: do 950 g t or 1,100 g t of steel consumption in the ball mills make sense? When we apply our experience from the last 20 years we see right away that steel consumption in the range of 1,000 g t in a ball mill is not correct,and that is a fact.Calculate material consumption Finance &amp OperationsStep consumption.Step consumption is used to calculate constant consumption in quantity intervals.If you select Step consumption in the Formula field on the Setup tab,you can add information about the steps on the Step consumption tab.The fixed consumed quantity can be set up in intervals of the produced quantity.
