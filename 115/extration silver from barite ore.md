## Missouri Barite DNR
Mining: Barite mining in Missouri began around 1850; however,early lead mining operations began as early as 1725 in the same area,but barite was cast aside as a waste product at that time Barite production data has been recorded from 1872 to present The Washington County deposit is the major source of Missouri’s barite productionHow to Extract Silver SaplingNov 22,2016&#0183;&#32;Extract Silver Step Buy or build an electrolysis machine This machine will help you to extract silver from your waste chemicals You can find electrolysis machines in science supply stores,or you can make your own using a 12 volt charger and a rubber tub
