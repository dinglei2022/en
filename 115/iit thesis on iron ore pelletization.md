## Studies on Highly Fluxed Iron Ore Pellets Hardened at 1100
Jan 24,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32The behaviors of highly fluxed (basicity 2,4,6,and 8) iron ore pellets heat hardened in the temperature range 1100 &#176C to 1200 &#176C were examined and are reported here.The highly fluxed (basicity 8) pellets exhibited 103 kg pellet crushing strength and&quotSustainable Iron Making Processes&quot by Urvashi SrivastavaIn other two different studies presented in this thesis proved that low grade iron ores can be used to directly produce metallic iron.Higher amount of iron was recovered when low grade ore was used to produce iron compared to upgraded ore.Another important area,iron ore pelletization
