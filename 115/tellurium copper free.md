## C14500 Alloy,C145 Tellurium Copper Concast
C14500,or tellurium copper,has similar mechanical properties to unalloyed,pure copper but with a higher machinability.Thus,the cutting properties of C14500 are enhanced significantly by creating a copper alloy with the addition of tellurium.Tellurium copper is also known for its high electrical conductivity characteristic.COPPER C109 Columbia MetalsC109.C109 is a freemachining grade of oxygenfree copper with an addition of around 0.5% tellurium.The tellurium content raises the machinability rating to 90% (free machining brass = 100%) with minimal effect on conductivity values and ductility.
