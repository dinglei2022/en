## How is carbonyl iron powder manufactured? BASF
How is carbonyl iron powder manufactured? The production process of carbonyl iron powder (CIP) was discovered by BASF in 1925.CIP is produced by thermal decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO) 5),which is previously distilled to high purity.The result is a wide selection of hard and soft,coated and uncoated varieties of carbonyl iron powder,which may be used in inductive componentsSpherical Ferromagnetic Iron Powder AMERICAN ELEMENTS2019115&ensp&#0183&enspSpherical Ferromagnetic Iron Powder is composed of highpurity iron microsphere particles with unique electromagnetic properties for use in electronics,power injection molding,sensors,and radiation shielding.
