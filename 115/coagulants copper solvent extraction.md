Solvent extraction,the process of extracting a specific metal valve from a solution to concentrate and purify that metal is a multistage process involving liquid ion exchange.In the first stage the metal value,in this example copper,exists in the aqueous leachate as an copper ion.The aqueous leachate is mixed with a organic solution containing a ion specific extractant.Solvent extraction: the coordination chemistry behindThis phenomenon is well documented and has been referred to as the Hofmeister bias because it is related to the Hofmeister Series that was established in 1888 to rank the efficacy of inorganic anions in the coagulation of proteins.31.Solvent extraction processes to separate metalate anions on the basis of their charge are easier to implement
