## Copper Smelting Process
We shall begin by looking at the mining and processing of the copper bearing ore,followed by an examination of an established and a modern copper smelting process.Mining for Copper Bearing Ore There are two categories of copper ore; sulphide ore which is processed to enrich it before smelting,and oxide ore that is subjected to acid treatment.Copper,Lead and Zinc Smelting and RefiningCopper,Lead and Zinc Smelting and Refining.During this process the copper matte is poured into a horizontal cylindrical vessel (approximately 10ґ4 m) fitted with a row of pipes.a process normally performed at the mining site.The zinc concentrate is then reduced to zinc metal in one of two ways: either pyrometallurgically by.
