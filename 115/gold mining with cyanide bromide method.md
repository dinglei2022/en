Mar 07,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32After several highprofile leaks and spills,the use of cyanide in mining operations is facing increasing public opposition with some countries banning it completely.The toxic chemical is still widely used for the processing of certain ores,most notably gold,but should cyanide be phased out ofGold cyanidation WikipediaGold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthurForrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from lowgrade ore by converting the gold to a watersoluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction.
