## Fly ash Wikipedia
Fly ash or flue ash,also known as pulverised fuel ash in the United Kingdom,is a coal combustion product that is composed of the particulates (fine particles of burned fuel) that are driven out of coalfired boilers together with the flue gases.Ash that falls to the bottom of the boiler's combustion chamber (commonly called a firebox) is called bottom ash.MP618&#174 Ash Beneficiation Technology Solves IndustryWideMP618 MultiProcess ash beneficiation technology provides utilities with immediate beneficiation of both wet and dry fly ash for current production and legacy ash stored in ponds or landfills.
