## The Phosphate Fertilizer Industry: An Environmental Overview
According to Robert Vanderslice,head of Phosphate Management for Florida's Department of Environmental Protection,the gypsum is a "good material to replace lime rock in roads.Lime rock will run out at some time,and we're still building a lot of roads.Building roads with phosphogypsum would consume quite a bit of gypsum."Natural radioactivity assessment of a phosphate fertilizer plant area.Rock phosphate ore processing and disposal of phosphogypsum contribute.Only 15% of world phosphogypsum production is recycled as building materials.
