## Mine to mill optimisation: effect of feed size on mill.
Over the past 15 years,mine to mill studies have focused attention on the impact blast fragmentation has on concentrator throughput.Blasting provides the first opportunity for comminution or size reduction.It is also a cheaper and more efficient process,compared to both crushing and grinding.Mineral processingThese separators are commonly used for separating mineral sands,an example of one of these mineral processing plants is the CRL processing plant at Pinkenba in Brisbane Queensland.In this plant,zircon,rutile and ilmenite are separated from the silica gangue.In this plant,the separation is performed in a number of stages with roughers.
