## The 7 Most Useful Manganese Ore Beneficiation Methods,
Most manganese today is obtained from ores found in Russia,Brazil,Australia,South Africa,Gabon,and India Pyrolusite and rhodochrosite are among the most common manganese minerals The metal is obtained by reduction of the oxide with sodium,magnesium,aluminum,or by electrolysis Los Alamos National Laboratory,US Department of EnergyList Metals used in Making Steel Alloys20191014&ensp&#0183&enspLess common ores are braunite containing about 70% manganese,manganite (Mn2O3.H2O) with 62%,and rhodochrosite (MnCO3) with 48%.Rhodonite,(MnSiO3),is sometimes found mixed with other manganese ores.Bog manganese (also called wad) is of variable composition.It is like bog iron,but is darker,often quite black.

## Manganese Simple English Wikipedia,the free encyclopedia
Manganese is a silvery gray metal and is part of the group known as the transition metalsIt is similar to iron It is hard to melt,but easy to oxidizeManganese forms chemical compounds in several oxidation states: +2,+4,and +7 are the most commonManganese compounds can be black,brown,pink,red,green,blue,and purpleMANGANESE ORES: FORMATION AND DISTRIBUTION20131127&ensp&#0183&enspManganese is used also for making other alloys,for making dry batteries,disinfectants,glass,colored brick,paints,chemicals,etc.It is used for flux in melting silver and gold ores.Manganese ores carrying less than 35 percent,of manganese normally do not command high prices.
