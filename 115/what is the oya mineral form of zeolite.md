What is it? First formed more than 300 million years ago,zeolite is a mineral mostly made up of silica (the third most abundant trace element in the human body) and alumina tetrahedra.There are many natural variations,each one unique to its environment.Some formed when volcanic rocks and ash reacted with seawater others are freshwater variations.The Differences Between Bentonite &amp; Zeolite LEAFtvBentonite and zeolite are two materials that are used in alternative medicine.Although both bentonite and zeolite are used to cleanse the body,the two purported healing agents come from different sources.Bentonite is a clay whereas zeolite is a crystallized mineral created by lava and water.
