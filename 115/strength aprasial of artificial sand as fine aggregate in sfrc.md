## Behaviour of Concrete on Replacement of Sand with Quaries
2.The strength achieved in concrete made with sand as fine aggregate achieved high strengths when compared with Quarry stone dust concrete.However,in both the cases strengths were falling at a super plasticiser dosage of 1.3% by weight of cement.Similar behaviour was also observed inAdoption of artificial lightweight aggregate in precastThe variation in the compressive strength obtained was less significant (3 5%),following 24 h of curing,than at 28 d (15%).A similar trend was observed across the range of densities and in the tensile and flexural strength tests,with a slightly increased workability also observed in the lightweight mixes.
