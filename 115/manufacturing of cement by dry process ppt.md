## How Cement Is Made
Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains.The cement is now ready for transport to readymix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects.Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement,some kilns in the United States use a wet process.Cement kiln WikipediaCement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of Portland and other types of hydraulic cement,in which calcium carbonate reacts with silicabearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silies.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year,and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity usually defines the capacity of the cement plant.
