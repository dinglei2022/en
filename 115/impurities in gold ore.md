## Ore processing Waihi Gold
Ore processing is a 24 hour operation.Ore is stockpiled (1) at the processing plant,and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader.The ore is conveyed,and lime is added (2) to raise the pH of the ore.Processing,smelting and refining gold World Gold CouncilThe two gold refining methods most commonly employed to derive pure gold are: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process.The Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified gold.
