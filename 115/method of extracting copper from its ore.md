## Copper extraction Wikipedia
Extraction and purification of copper.Copper is less reactive than carbon,so it can be extracted from its ores by heating it with carbon.For example,copper is formed if copper oxide is heated strongly with charcoal which is mostly carbon:Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores.On the other hand,while copper sulfide ores are less abundant,they contain higher amounts of copper.Although the processing costs are higher,ultimately more copper can be extracted.Since each mine site is unique in its mineral composition,concentration,and quantities,the most economical and profitable processing of ore must be.
