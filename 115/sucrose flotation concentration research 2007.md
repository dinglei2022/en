## Comparison of current methods used to detect
Flotation methods use a liquid suspending medium that is denser than the oocysts being concentrated.This can be used for the purpose of both concentration and purifiion.The most commonly used solution or media are: sheather sucrose flotation (SSF),zinc sulphate flotation (ZSF) and saturated sodium chloride salt flotation (SSSF).Sucrose Crystallization in Vibrated Bed Process,UnusualThrough yield and Sauter mean diameter,the sucrose crystallization was studied in vibrated bed equipment,in which,supersaturation degree,dimensionless vibration number and crystallization time were independent variables.A central composite design with seventeen trials was performed in order to ascertain the influence of each variable in both responses,the crystallization temperature and
