## The Effects and Economic Impact of Corrosion
The Effects and Economic Impact of Corrosion CORROSION is a natural process.Just like water flows to the lowest level,all natural processes tend toward the lowest possible energy states.Thus,for example,iron and steel have a natural tendency to combine with other chemical elements to return to their lowest energy states.Zinc toxicology following particulate inhalationZinc compounds can produce irritation and corrosion of the gut,acute renal tubular necrosis and interstitial nephritis.Inhalation would presumably contribute partially to pathological effects on the kidneys.Zinc toxicity can be treated with calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate,a chelator.

## What is Copper Corrosion? Definition from Corrosionpedia
Copper corrosion is the corrosion of materials made of copper or copper alloys.When exposed to the atmosphere,copper oxidizes,causing bright copper surfaces to tarnish.After a few years,this tarnish gradually changes to dark brown or black,and finally to green.effect of pH level on corrosion rate SlideShareJan 12,2013&nbsp&#0183&#32effect of pH level on corrosion rate 1.AKINPELUMI K.F 100401013To investigate the effect of pH level on corrosion rate A Short Laboratory Report Presented To The Department of Chemical Engineering BY AKINPELUMI,K.F.(Group B) Mat No.100401013 In Partial Fulfillment Of the Requirements for the Course Chemical Engineering Laboratory II University of Lagos,Lagos June 28,
