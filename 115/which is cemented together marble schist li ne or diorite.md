## Breccia: Sedimentary Rock Pictures,Definition,Formation
What is Breccia? Breccia is a term most often used for clastic sedimentary rocks that are composed of large angular fragments (over two millimeters in diameter).The spaces between the large angular fragments are filled with a matrix of smaller particles and a mineral cement that binds the rock together.Sedimentary Rocks Earth Science Google SitesIn the case of the ancient sand dunes,wind was the environmental force that caused sand particles to accumulate over such long periods.All sedimentary rocks are made of materials called sediments deposited by a particular force or process.Those sediment deposits then become cemented or compacted together over time,forming a solid rock.
