## Removing a shrink fit pinion from a shaft : engineering
I work for a heavy fab and machining company that is constantly using torches or liquid Nitrogen to expand or shrink interference fits.I'm not really sure the scale of equipment you have,and everything I work with weighs multiple tons,but here is a process for you: The trick here is to heat the pinion evenly from the outside in while avoiding putting too much heat directly next to the shaft.Industrial Shrink Fit Industrial,LaboratoryPress fit or Shrink fit bushing design and installation is a common method of retaining bearings by use of interference between the bushing and the bushing hole.Bushings are available in standard sizes with both inside and outside diameter surfaces finished,and are commonly available in many sizes.

## PSL Shrink fitting with liquid nitrogen (LN2)
Shrink fitting is a method of fitting components that use an interference fit,it does this using thermal contraction i.e.a component such as a bushing can be cooled using liquid nitrogen (LN2) which causes it to become smaller and easily fit into it's housing until it becomes warm again and returns to it's original size.This method is better than fitting the components using force orNitrogen Services Technical Appliion of Liquid NitrogenAn immediate resolution is required.By using liquid nitrogen,expensive press equipment is freed quickly,and most importantly,without damage to the component parts.After enclosing the effected area with a foil bag,liquid nitrogen is fed into the temporary reservoir causing the jammed metal to cool shrink.Benefits of this method include:
