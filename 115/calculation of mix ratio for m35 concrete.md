## Concrete Grades And Mix Ratio Mix Design Of Concrete
The grades of concrete stand for the ratio with which the components of concrete i.e.cement,fine aggregate (Sand) and coarse aggregate is blended.IS 4562000 has designated the concrete mixes into a number of grades as M10,M15,M20,M25,M30,M35 and M40.Concrete Calculator Estimate Cement,Sand,GravelExample calculation Estimate the quantity of cement,sand and stone aggregate required for 1 cubic meter of 1:2:4 concrete mix.Ans.Materials required are 7 nos.of 50 kg bag of cement,0.42 m 3 of sand and 0.83 m 3 of stone aggregate.

## Calculate WaterCement Ratio in Design of Concrete Mix
Because of improper calculation of watercement ratio gives an adverse effect like segregation,bleeding,decrease in strength of concrete,decrease in durability of concrete etc.These steps will help you to calculate watercement ratio in the design of the concrete mix so that you can control the quality of concrete.Also Read:CONCRETE MIXING RATIOS Everything About ConcreteThe less water you use to mix the concrete (somewhat dry but workable) the stronger the concrete mix.Accurate concrete mixing ratios can be achieved by measuring the dry materials using buckets or some other kind of measuring device.By measuring the mixing ratios you will have a consistent concrete mix throughout your entire project.
