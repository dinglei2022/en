## Characterization of Chemical Composition and
The study aimed at investigating the chemical composition and microstructure of raw iron ore from the deposits in Muko area (southwestern Uganda).The quality of this iron ore was evaluated to establish its suitability to serve as a raw material for iron production.Samples were taken from the six hills of Muko ore deposits and tests carried out to establish their composition and properties.Limonite: an iron oxide used as pigment and iron ore GeologyLimonite has been used as a lowquality iron ore for thousands of years.Commercial mining of limonite as a source of iron is no longer done in areas where reasonable deposits of hematite and magnetite are present or readily imported.Limonite deposits are usually too

## Hematite Article about hematite by The Free Dictionary
Hematite ores are ferrous ores of great importance,being used for smelting cast iron and steel.Iron content in solid hematite ores fluctuates from 50 percent to 65 percent.The largest deposits are connected with the oldest Precambrian ferriferous quartzites (jaspilites).ILMENITE (Iron Titanium Oxide) Amethyst GalleriesIlmenite by itself is not a profitable iron ore as the titanium inhibits the smelting process.Ilmenite,hematite and corundum all have similar structures and belong to a more or less informal group called the Hematite Group with a general formula of A 2 O 3.The structure is composed of alternating layers of ions and oxygens.

## Bandediron formations (BIFs) Evidence of Oxygen in
Summary: Bandediron formations (BIFs) are sedimentary mineral deposits consisting of alternating beds of ironrich minerals (mostly hematite) and silicarich layers (chert or quartz) formed about 3.0 to 1.8 billion years ago.Theory suggests BIFs are associated with the capture of oxygen released by photosynthetic processes by iron dissolved in ancient ocean water.Types Of Iron Ore In Pakistan roicompanyMining in Pakistan Wikipedia.There are four main types of ironore deposits worked currently,depending on the mineralogy and geology of the ore deposits.These are magnetite,titanomagnetite,massive hematite and pisolitic ironstone deposits.Banded iron formations.
