## CALCULATING CAPACITY TRENDS IN ROTARY DRYERS
Abstract This paper provides a methodology developed for the calculation of the feed rate and of the exit air conditions in an adiabatic rotary dryer,which operates with granular,nonporous solids having only unbound surface moisture.Some aspects related to the algorithm are also discussed inMODELLING OF FERTILIZER DRYING IN A ROTARYMODELLING OF FERTILIZER DRYING IN A ROTARY DRYER: The drying rate is evaluated in each infinitesimal Modelling of Fertilizer Drying in a Rotary Dryer:
