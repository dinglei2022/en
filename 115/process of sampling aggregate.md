41 This practice is intended for use in determining the sample size required to estimate,with specified precision,a measure of quality of a lot or process The practice applies when quality is expressed as either the lot average for a given property,or as the lot fraction not conforming to prescribed standardsConstruction aggregate WikipediaConstruction aggregate,or simply "aggregate",is a broad category of coarse to medium grained particulate material used in construction,including sand,gravel,crushed stone,slag,recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregat Aggregates are the most mined materials in the world

Nov 17,2019&#0183;&#32;Platelet aggregation is a crucial step in the process of clot formation,which stops bleeding A platelet aggregation test can be performed to determine how well platelets are sticking together The test measures this by using a platelet antagonist to initiate clumping in the patient's blood sampleASTM D75 D75MNote 3: The preliminary investigation and sampling of potential aggregate sources and types occupies a very important place in determining the availability and suitability of the largest single constituent entering into the construction.It influences the type of construction from the standpoint of economics and governs the necessary material control to ensure durability of the resulting.
