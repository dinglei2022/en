## US3988420A Processes for the manufacture of feedgrade
The invention relates to a combined process for the manufacture of feed grade dicalcium phosphate and pure phosphoric acid.The process comprises the reaction of an excess of phosphate rock with aqueous solutions of a mineral acid selected from hydrochloric acid,phosphoric acid and nitric acid,characterized by the fact that the free acidity of the dissolution liquor does not exceed 60% andDicalcium Phosphate KEMAPCO Arab Fertilizers andDicalcium phosphate is a crystalline feed grade Dicalcium phosphate containing 19.0% Minimum phosphorous and 28.0% Maximum calcium.The selected raw material of nonanimal origin and the production process ensures an end product with good phosphorous digestibility and a content of undesirable elements well below that stipulated by EU feed legislation.

## Dicalcium phosphate Wikipedia
Dicalcium phosphate is the calcium phosphate with the formula CaHPO 4 and its dihydrate.The &quotdi&quot prefix in the common name arises because the formation of the HPO 4 2 anion involves the removal of two protons from phosphoric acid,H 3 PO 4.It is also known as dibasic calcium phosphate or calcium monohydrogen phosphate.US1235025A Process of making dicalcium phosphateIn a method of making dicalcium phosphate,the steps which consist in treating phosphate rock with hydrochloric acid under heat,cooling the mixture to abut 30 C.treating the liquid product with calcium hydroxid to secure amorphous dicalcium phosphate,soluble in ammonium citrate filtering 01f the precipitate and then drying the remaining
