## Alternative Fuels Data Center: Ethanol Production
Most ethanol in the United States is produced from starchbased crops by dry or wetmill processing.Nearly 90% of ethanol plants are dry mills due to lower capital costs.Drymilling is a process that grinds corn into flour and ferments it into ethanol with coproducts of distillers grains and carbon dioxide.Dry and HighMoisture Corn as Affected by Processing anddry and highmoisture corn in dry matter consumed,rate of gain and feed efficiency.Feeding twice daily brought about slight improvements in gain and feed efficiency with the advantage over once daily being slightly greater for the highmoisture corn.Comparisons of the diets with and without roughage and dry corn are shown in table 4.
