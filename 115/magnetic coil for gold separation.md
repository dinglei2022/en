## Electromagnetic coil Wikipedia
An electromagnetic coil is an electrical conductor such as a wire in the shape of a coil,spiral or helix Electromagnetic coils are used in electrical engineering,in applications where electric currents interact with magnetic fields,in devices such as electric motors,generators,inductors,electromagnets,transformers,and sensor coilsMetal Detector Basics — Packwood Prospecting & Mining Supplies.Non magnetic metals include aluminum,gold,silver,bronze,platinum,and brass.Coil Size and Shape: Ground penetration is generally a little deeper than the diameter of.and a pouch or apron will help to keep trash separate from treasure.

## Superconducting Magnetic Separators
The phenomena of magnetism is well known.The way in which materials respond to a magnetic field can be predicted and the design of magnet systems is now regularly modelled on computer.The real step forward has been in the use of superconducting wire wound magnets that enable much higher fields to be generated.Conventional and familiar is the generation of a magneticmagnetic separation black sand dry miningmagnetic separation black sand dry mining; magnetic separator for gold mining espace running plusbe Black Sand Gold Mining is usually associated with beaches,some NZ beaches A magnet passed over the sands will lift them off the non magnetic gold in gold mining equipment that enable the separation of gold from black sand without
