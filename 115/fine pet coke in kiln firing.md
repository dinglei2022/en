## Petroleum Coke
Petroleum coke (also known as pet coke) is a carbonaceous solid derived from the cracking processes of oil refineries and has been a source of relatively cheap pulverized fuel for the kiln industry.It is called green coke until it is thermally treated into crystalline or.Cement kilnIn indirect firing,the fuel is ground by an intermittently run mill,and the fine product is stored in a silo of sufficient size to supply the kiln though fuel mill stoppage periods.The fine fuel is metered out of the silo at a controlled rate and blown into the kiln.

## Cement Plants: Coke
Coke from Coal.The coke produced from coal was one of the major commodities of the Industrial Revolution,coming to prominence with the invention by Abraham Darby of the cokefired blast furnace.Subsequently,the development of the coal gas supply industry in the nineteenth century greatly increased the amount of coke produced.Coke (fuel)Coke is a grey,hard,and porous fuel with a high carbon content and few impurities,made by heating coal or oil in the absence of air — a destructive distillation process.It is an important industrial product,used mainly in iron ore smelting,but also as a fuel in stoves and forges when air pollution is a concern.The unqualified term.
