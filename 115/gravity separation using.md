## Gravity separation Wikipedia
Gravity separation is an industrial method of separating two components,either a suspension,or dry granular mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical: i.e.the components of the mixture have different specific weight.All of the gravitational methods are common in the sense that they all use gravity as the dominant force.Gravity separation of coarse particles using the RefluxThe article makes an effort in consolidating the developments in the field of advanced gravity separation techniques for processing fine particles over the last few decades.

## How Gravity Separators Work Density Separation
Gravity alone,with equal intensity on all bodies regardless of size or weight,would be of no use unless there were some other resisting force,sensitive to size and weight,to balance it.And taken further to understand how a gravity separator works,the stratifiion upon which the separation largely depends,is made according to theGravity separation of coarse particles using the Reflux.Callen,S.Spear Keywords: Coal preparation Gravity concentration Separation Fluidization Particle Sedimentation Inclined sedimentation Coal Elutriati.
