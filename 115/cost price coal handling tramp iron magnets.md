## About Eriez
In 1941,Orange Fowler Merwin,or &quotO.F.&quot as he was known,sold equipment to grain millers.The most common complaints heard from his customers were about &quottramp iron&quot stray pieces of metal such as bits of wire,nails and bolts,even horseshoes and hammers,that somehow found their way into the grain the farmers brought to the mills for grinding.Eriez Suspended Permanent MagnetsModel CP 20 80L Permanent Magnets.The CP 20 80L are ideal for general tramp iron removal from a range of materials.CP magnets utilize a permanent magnet circuit to provide a continuous and uniform magnetic field across the feed belt to optimize separation efficiency of damaging tramp iron.
