## Froth flotation Wikipedia
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing,paper recycling and wastewater treatment industries.Historically this was first used in the mining industry,where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.Optimization of Flotation Reagents' SpecificOptimization of Flotation Reagents' Specific Consumption by Modeling During Mineral Enrichment.Introduction Flotation is a process of separating precious minerals from the gangue,based on the differences in the surface properties of the particles,using reagents added in the presence of air bubbles.
