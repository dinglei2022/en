## Construction aggregate Wikipedia
Construction aggregate,or simply &quotaggregate" is a broad egory of coarse to medium grained particulate material used in construction,including sand,gravel,crushed stone,slag,recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates.Aggregates are the most mined materials in the world.Home Recycled Aggregate ProductsUsing recycled materials preserves our virgin deposits.Our material requires less energy to process.We recycle all of our onsite concrete &amp asphalt material.No virgin land is disturbed.We are competitively priced to comparable virgin material products.Lower traffic,less waste and a commitment to conservation of our raw materials.
