## Meat Processing Wastewater Treatment DAF Systems
Meat processing facilities produce wastewater with heavy loads of fats,oils,grease and solids.Before sending that water down the sewer drain,pretreatment is required to remove as much of these solids and oils as possible.Dissolved Air Floatation (DAF) SA WaterFor existing sites where SA Water has determined that discharge quality significantly exceeds one or more acceptance limits,and DAF or similar pretreatment is a practical solution.For proposed new trade waste discharges,if DAF is proven in comparable situations to be a Dissolved Air Floatation (DAF) SA Water
