Nov 13,2017&#0183;&#32;The Kroll Process is the ideal way of producing titanium for commercial use It has replaced the Hunter Process of reducing titanium tetrachloride with sodium to produce pure titanium (1) This is due to the fact that the Kroll Process is more economical,because the use of magnesium,as a reductant,is cheaper than using sodiumTitanium SlideShareTitanium,1 Extraction of Titanium 2 Introduction Of Titanium It is a transition metal Member of group four in periodic table it’s atomic number is 22 It’s mass number is 4787 It has 5 stable isotopes with mas number 46 50 respectively It also has 4 unstable isotopes with,

## History Production of Titanium krollprocess.weebly
The Kroll process replaced the Hunter process for all commercial titanium productions and it became the essential basis of modern titanium production.William J.Kroll is now recognized as the father of the titanium industry.(1)Potential Dangers Production of TitaniumTiCl4 is irritating to the eyes,skin,mucous membrane and the lungs if large amounts are inhaled Although it is highly unlikely to be exposed to TiCl4 under normal conditions,because it breaks down when in contact with water,occupational exposure to TiCl4 is common,such as in the production of titanium
