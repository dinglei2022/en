Rubidium was discovered in 1861 but had extremely limited industrial use until the 1920s.Small quantities of rubidiumcontaining minerals were mined in the United States prior to the mid1960s,but rubidium is no longer mined domestically.Historically,the most important use for rubidium has been in research and development,primarily inMetals: Mines,Alkali,Alkaline Earth,Transition,PostThe mining of metal can be dated back to early century and it has been passing on meritoriously over the past years so that we meet our day to day needs of the desired material usage starting from equipments we use to ornaments we wear.Metal mining offers the miners a wonderful mining experience.
