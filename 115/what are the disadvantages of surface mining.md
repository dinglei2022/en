## Underground v.s.Surface Coal Mines: Is Deep Drilling
Although there are opponents and proponents of underground mining,the disadvantages include destruction of land,surface subsidence,abandoned shafts,extensive surface spoil heaps,mine explosions,collapses and flooding.That doesn't incorporate the costly price tag that comes with underground mining.What Are The Advantages Of Surface Mining Of CoalAuger mining is a surface mining technique used to recover additional coal from a seam loed behind a highwall produced either by stripping or openpit mining.Auger mining is especially employed when contour strip mining has been exhausted and the removal of overburden to access additional coal no longer becomes economically feasible.
