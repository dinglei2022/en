## Primary Crushing Best Maintenance Practices and Application
JAW DIE WEAR !!! Note: Trying to over utilize jaw dies imposes unnecessary and excessive loads on the crusher! This creates an event called compaction.The loads can be multiplied 5 times the normal crushing forces as a result of worn dies.Damage to the crusher can and eventually will result.Caved in die Retains material Excessively Worn Jaw Die
