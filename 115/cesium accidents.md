## ATSDR Public Health Statement: Cesium
2015121&ensp&#0183&enspCesium is a naturally occurring element found in rocks,soil,and dust at low concentrations.Granites contain an average cesium concentration of about 1 part of cesium in a million parts of granite (ppm) and sedimentary rocks contain about 4 ppm.Natural cesium is present in the environment in only one stable form (isotope),133 Cs.The Isotopes of the Fukushima Disaster Ricochet ScienceDec 01,2014&nbsp&#0183&#32Cesium134 and Cesium137.Perhaps the biggest concern following the Fukushima disaster was the release of radioactive cesium.Naturally,cesium (Cs) is a metal with an atomic number of 55 and an atomic mass of approximately 132.9.However,within a nuclear reactor two isotopes of cesium (Cs134 and Cs137) are formed.
