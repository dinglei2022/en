## Void Ratio for Common Gravel &amp Sand Sciencing
Gravel typically has a void ratio about 0.4,regardless of whether it is well or poorly graded,although the void ratio can be affected by the presence of impurities,such as clay or silt.Gravel with clay has a void ratio of about 0.25,while gravel with silt can have a void ratio of 0.2 or less.Concrete Aggregates Function,PropertiesConcrete is contains 70% aggregates by volume.So understanding properties and function of aggregates plays an important role in determining the strength of concrete.Here is a detail on various properties,functions,characteristics and significance of Aggregates used in Concrete
