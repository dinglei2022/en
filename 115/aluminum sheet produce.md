## How aluminum is made material,manufacture,making,used
It takes about 4 lb (2 kg) of bauxite to produce 1 lb (0.5 kg) of aluminum metal.Caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) is used to dissolve the aluminum compounds found in the bauxite,separating them from the impurities.Depending on the composition of the bauxite ore,relatively small amounts of other chemicals may be used in the extractionWhat is Alclad? Definition from CorrosionpediaAlclad is a duplex metal product made by cladding an aluminum alloy core with surface layers of pure aluminum or aluminum alloy,resulting in increased resistance to corrosion.It is a sandwich of highstrength aluminum alloy between two sheets of commercially pure metal for a combination of strength and corrosion resistance produced by rolling.
