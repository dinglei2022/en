## Soul Searchin: Turkey Foot Falls and Mize Mill in the.
Turkey Foot Falls and Mize Mill in the Sipsey Wilderness Story goes as far as I know this old 1936 Ford wrecked off what was the old run that ran near what we know as Cranal Road now.I don't believe anyone died but I could be wrong.I can't believe this thing is still here.Kenadi tells me this is one of her favorite spots in the forest.Flickr: Discussing Mize Mills Falls in Bankhead &amp SipseyMay 14,2007&nbsp&#0183&#32If instead you go straight down to Mize Mills,it is very steep.If,however,you go down to the river junction,it is not quite as steep.You will cross the river right near Turkey Foot Falls.Then,go back upstream on the west side to get to Mize Mills.The trails are in a fairly narrow canyon.
