Cyanide has been used for gold mining for more then 100 years.If not used properly it can be deathly.When ingested or inhaled can cause death within 60 min.There are no other alternatives for cyanide.cyanide can be bad for the environment.There arebalanced chemical equation for mining goldbalanced chemical equation for mining gold 3.6: Quantitative Information from Balanced Equations.Check the chemical equation to make sure it is balanced as written; balance if necessary.Then calculate the number of moles of [Au(CN) 2] − present by.

And Balanced equation.Acid Mine Drainage: Chemistry COTFAcid Mine Drainage: Chemistry Acid mine drainage impacts stream and river ecosystems through acidity,ferric ion (Fe 3+) precipitation,oxygen depletion,and release of heavy metals associated with coal and metal mining,such as aluminum (Al 3+),zinc (Zn 2+),and manganese (Mn 2+).When mineral deposits that contain sulfides are mined,they have the potential to produce acid mine drainage.
