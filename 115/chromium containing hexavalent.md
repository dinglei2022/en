## Criteria for a Recommended Standard Occupational Exposure
Hexavalent Chromium [NIOSH 1975a,2005a].Cr(VI) compounds include a large group of chemicals with varying chemical properties,uses,and workplace exposures.Their properties include corrosionresistance,durability,and hardness.Sodium dichromate is the most common chromium chemical from which other Cr(VI) compounds may be produced.Photochemical reduction of hexavalent chromium in …Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] in the form of potassium dichromate was photochemically reduced to trivalent chromium [Cr(III)] in aqueous solutions containing glycerol.This reaction occurred rapidly during irradiation with either unfiltered sunlight or a UVA emitting.
