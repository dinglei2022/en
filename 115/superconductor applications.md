## What are some applications of superconductors? Quora
 · The main uses of superconductors are due to: 1.Meissner's effect,ie.when they are placed in a magnetic field,a superconductor has zero magnetic field inside it.Hence,the material is repelled by permanent magnets strongly and "perfectly" by virtue of which it finds applications in all places wherever magnetic levitation is required.Explainer: what is a superconductor? The ConversationSuperconductors have already found applications outside the laboratory in technologies such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).MRI machines use superconductors to …
