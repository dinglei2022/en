Jun 08,2019&#0183;&#32;A power plant can be of several types depending mainly on the type of fuel used Since for the purpose of bulk power generation,only thermal,nuclear and hydro power comes handy,therefore a power generating station can be broadly classified in the 3 above mentioned typ Let us have a look in these types of power stations in details Thermal Power StationBasic Layout and Working of a Nuclear Power PlantRest parts of a nuclear power plant are very similar to conventional thermal power plants.It is found that fission of only 1 Kg of Uranium produces as much heat energy as that can be produced by 4,500 tons of high grade coal.This considerably reduces the transportation cost of fuel,which is a major advantage of nuclear power plants.Also

## Natural gas power plant Energy Education
Natural gas power plants generate electricity by burning natural gas as their fuelThere are many types of natural gas power plants which all generate electricity,but serve different purpos All natural gas plants use a gas turbine; natural gas is added,along with a stream of air,which combusts and expands through this turbine causing a generator to spin a magnet,making electricityPresentation on thermal power plant&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Pulverizing Plant • In modern thermal power plant,coal is pulverized • ground to dust like size and carried to the furnace in a stream of hot air.• Pulverizing is a means of exposing a large surface area to the action of oxygen and consequently helping combustion.
