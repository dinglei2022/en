## Heap leaching Wikipedia
Heap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals,copper,uranium,and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and reseparate them after their division from other earth materials.Similar to in situ mining,heap leach mining differs in that it places ore on a liner,then adds the chemicals via drip systems to theToiyabeSaddle Deposit (MRDS #10310330) AUThe Toiyabe mine was a small gold mining and heap leaching operation from 19871991 owned by Inland Gold &amp Silver Corporation.The Toiyabe mine has been abandoned and reclaimed it lies on a claim block adjacent to and south of the Toiyabe Property.
