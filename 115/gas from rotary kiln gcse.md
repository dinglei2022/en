## IBUtec The Rotary Kiln Experts for Trials and Production
Rotary kilns (sometimes called calciners or rotary furnaces) are used for thermal treatment processes such as calcination,sintering,pyrolysis and firing,as well as for oxidation and reduction.These treatments can be applied to powders,granulates,suspensions and green bodies.A rotary kiln consists of a cylindrical,rotating body mounted between stationary material feed and outlet housings.Rotary Kilns fikccin the Freeboard of a Rotary Kiln 196 7.13 Radiative Exchange from the Freeboard Gas to Exposed Bed and Wall Surfaces 198 7.14 Radiative Heat Transfer among Exposed Freeboard Surfaces 199 8 Heat Transfer Processes in the Rotary Kiln Bed 205 8.1 Heat Transfer Between the Covered Wall and the Bed 207 8.2 Modified Penetration Model for Rotary Kiln

## 2.3 Medical Waste Incineration
2.3.1.3 Rotary Kiln Incinerators Rotary kiln incinerators,like the other types,are designed with a primary chamber,where waste is heated and volatilized,and a secondary chamber,where combustion of the volatile fraction is completed.The primary chamber consists of a slightly inclined,rotating kiln in which waste materialsRotary Kilns HarbisonWalker InternationalHarbisonWalker International offers THERMAX &#174 and Rib Back brick.Both have hollowedout cold faces that help provide insulation,thereby giving our customers cooler shell temperatures.Tumblers are precast or cast in place and are installed in lime rotary kilns to "agitate" the load.This provides improved heat transfer and lime quality.
