When we use this type of concrete we achieve large volume by less amount of concrete.The manufacturing process of this type of concrete does not involve any high cost techniques.Manufacturing process of CLC is similar to normal concrete and in this additionally foam generating machine is used.Fly Ash Based Cellular Lightweight ConcreteEco Friendly Alternatives To Traditional Concrete,18 07 2019&#0183;&#32;Fly Ash is mixed with lime and water to make it strong and durable,similar to conventional cement Use of fly ash in Ashcrete makes it an environment friendly alternative,since it can replace cement which in turn leads to reduced CO2 emissions Moreover,25% of cement can be replaced using high volume fly ash concrete

## Fly ash brick Wikipedia
Fly ash brick (FAB) is a building material,specifically masonry units,containing class C or class F fly ash and water.Compressed at 28 MPa (272 atm) and cured for 24 hours in a 66 &#176C steam bath,then toughened with an air entrainment agent,the bricks last for more than 100 freezethaw cycles.Owing to the high concentration of calcium oxide in class C fly ash,the brick is described asCellular Lightweight Concrete Seminar Report,PPT,PDFContent of air in concrete approx.= 43%.Content of FlyAsh = 33% • In this process,first the wet mix slurry consists of fly ash,cement,sand and water is either poured or pumped into assembled moulds of blocks or formwork of reinforced structural elements or poured onto flat
