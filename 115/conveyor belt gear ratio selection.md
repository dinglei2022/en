## How to Size and Select a Gearbox: A Motion Engineer's Guide
Aug 24,2012&nbsp&#0183&#32This information comes from charts from gearbox manufacturers that list classes of service.To use these charts,the design engineer must know input horsepower,appliion type and target ratio.For instance,suppose that an appliion needs a 2hp motor with a 15:1 ratio.To use the chart,find the point where 2 hp and 15:1 ratio intersect.what is a good gear ratio for slow speed conveyor belt,They said I have a gear motor with a 120:1 ratio and a belt,I'd like to slow the conveyor to about half the speed,and bottom to git some good,
