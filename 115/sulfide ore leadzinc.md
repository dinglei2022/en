## EXTRACTING METALS FROM SULFIDE ORES Electrochemical
Thus,for example,the three metals in copper lead zinc ores can be floated into three concentrates,each containing one of the metals.The process of flotation is sometimes also used in electrochemical waste treatment.Extractive metallurgy Metal sulfide flotation concentrates can be treated in a number of ways.Pyrite Activation in the LeadZinc Tailings Recovery XinhaiMost nonferrous metals are metal sulfides ores,such as leadzinc ore,copper sulfide,which often coexist with a large number of pyrites.Pyrite is the main raw material for industrial sulfuric acid,but China is a leading manufacturer and consumer of sulfuric acid,so the comprehensive utilization of pyrite plays an important role in leadzinc tailings recovery.

## FROTH FLOTATION : RECENT TRENDS Flotation of Sulphide
History of Sulphide ore flotation dates back to beginning of 20th century.Sulphide ores are major sources of base metals like Copper,Lead,Zinc,Nickel,Cobalt etc.Beneficiation of these base metal sulphide minerals is predominating through froth flotation technique.This technology has acclaimed importance as a versatile process forSulfide Ore an overview ScienceDirect TopicsThe beneficial effect of pyrite addition in the dissolution of sphalerite from a complex copper lead zinc sulfide ore is illustrated in Fig.9.10.After 30 days of leaching,more than 90% zinc could be dissolved in the added presence of pyrite and bacteria.

## Introduction to Mineral Processing Chevron Phillips Chemical
In ore beneficiation,flotation is a process in which valuable minerals are separated from worthless material or other valuable minerals by inducing them to gather in and on the surface of a froth layer.Sulfide and nonsulfide minerals as well as native metals are recovered by froth flotation.Zinc ore and mines Minerals and mines Foundations ofLocally it was known as 'dry bone' ore,having a cellular to spongy appearance reminiscent of dry bone.Calamine is actually a secondary mineral,found principally in the oxidized zone of the zincbearing ore deposits.It is derived from the alteration of the primary zinc sulphide (ZnS) mineral sphalerite.
