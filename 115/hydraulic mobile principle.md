## What Is the Definition of Hydraulic Lift? Sciencing
A hydraulic lift is a type of machine that uses a hydraulic apparatus to lift or move objects using the force created when pressure is exerted on liquid in a piston.Force then produces &quotlift&quot and &quotwork.&quot Function Hydraulic lift technology has a multitude of industrial appliions,like constructionHydraulics Basic Level Textbook Yazd• and mobile hydraulics Mobile hydraulic systems move on wheels or tracks,for example,unlike stationary hydraulic systems which remain firmly fixed in one position.A characteristic feature of mobile hydraulics is that the valves are frequently manually operated.In the case of stationary hydraulics,however,mainly solenoid valves are used.
