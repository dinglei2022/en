Generally the assemblage of ore minerals is chalcopyrite,pyrite,enargite,covellite,bornite,and molybdenum.Gangue minerals vary depending on the type of alteration related to mineralization.For example in the potassic alteration zone,chalcopyrite is the ore mineral found with gangue minerals of biotite and kfeldspar (Roberts,1973)(RuskGeochemistry of hydrothermal gold deposits: A reviewMineral assemblages formed during hydrothermal alteration reflect the geochemical composition of oreforming fluids.Gold is mainly transported in solution as Au Cl and Au S complexes.The change of physicochemical conditions such as temperature,pressure,oxygen fugacity,and sulfur fugacity are effective mechanisms for gold precipitation.
