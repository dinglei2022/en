## FLOTATION
Flotation is a process in Liquid Solid Separation technology whereby solids in suspension are recovered by their attachment to gas (usually air) bubbles,usually with objective of removing the solids from the liquid.The particles most effectively removed are in the size range from 10 to 200 μm.The particle bubble aggregates that are formed have a density less than the suspension itself.Method to enhance the concentration of valuable minerals in froth.Dec 4,2017.Enhancing Selectivity and Recovery in the Fractional Flotation of Flotation Column.of valuable minerals in froth flotation process used in mining.Previously used methods of separation may produce a high amount of.
