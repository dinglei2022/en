Tungsten is mostly obtained from the minerals scheelite and wolframite.Tungsten is not refined by smelting or through any other method through which other metals are refined since it has the highest melting point above any other metal.The surface mining methods are used when the tungsten minerals are found in the earth's surface where underground digging is not required.Tungsten Metal (W) Element Chemical + Physical PropertiesThe chemical symbol for tungsten is W which stands for Wolfram.The name came from medieval German smelters who found that tin ores containing tungsten had a much lower yield.It was said that the tungsten devoured the tin "like a wolf".Pure tungsten metal was first isolated by two Spanish chemists,the de Elhujar brothers in 1783.

## History of Tungsten International Tungsten Industry
History of Tungsten.Tungsten,like all the elements having a higher atomic number than iron (Z&gt26),cannot be formed by nuclear fusion processes in stars,as is the case for those elements with a lower atomic number,but originates only by neutron or proton absorption of already existing bigger nuclei.These capture processes with extremely high fluxes of neutrons and protons occur exclusivelyTungsten PlanseeTungsten was first found in the Ore Mountains of Central Europe in the Middle Ages during the process of tin reduction.However,at that time it was considered to be an unwanted accompanying element.The tungsten ore facilitated slag formation during the reduction of tin and consequently impaired the yield.
