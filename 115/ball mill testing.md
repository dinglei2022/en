Oct 15,2015&nbsp&#0183&#32Hardgrove testing machines use compression breakage modes similar to those in a vertical spindle mill,whereas planetary ball mills use high impact breakage modes.The HGI test was developed for coal fired power plants,and the target 75 μm size is based on what is required for combustion in pulverised fuel coal burners.However biomass hasGraphite Processing,Extraction,Crushing&Grinding Plant,It is necessary to undertake the lab test or even pilot test for determining primary flake size and liberation size,improving the TGC grade as high as possible,meanwhile to find the suitable grinding flotation way to reserve the big flake size graphite,The ball mill is,

## Improved characterisation of ball milling energy
Jan 15,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Because of its wide acceptability in the industry,the Bond ball mill test is the most pragmatic choice for investigating the ball milling requirements of HPGR products,but it may not be the most accurate.This study aims to separate the preweakening (or microcracking) effect of HPGR from the fines production in the Bond ball mill test results.
