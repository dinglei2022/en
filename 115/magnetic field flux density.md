## Magnetic flux density by material property Magnetic.
This magnetic flux,due to Lenz's law tends to act to oppose ch anges in the flux by generating a voltage (a back EMF) that counters or tends to reduce the rate of change in the current.where Φ denotes the magnetic flux through the area spanned by the loop,and N is the number of wire turns.Magnetism: quantities,units and relationships22 Jul 2014.Magnetic field strength cannot be measured in the same way because there is no &#39;magnetic monopole&#39; equivalent to a test charge.Do not confuse magnetic field strength with flux density,B.This is closely related to field strength but depends also on the material within the field.The strict definition of H is.

## Magnetic Fields due to currents Mini Physics Learn.
The magnetic flux density at a distance d from the current carrying wire is given by: $B = \frac{\mu {o} I }{2 \pi d}$,where $I$ is the current through theDifference Between Magnetic Field and Magnetic FluxThe magnetic field strength (the magnetic flux density) can be defined using the force felt by a particle of charge travelling through it at a velocity :.If the magnetic field is perpendicular to the direction of particle’s motion,then we have,If the term “magnetic field” is used to refer to a quantity rather than a region,it is most likely referring to the magnetic field strength.
