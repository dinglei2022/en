## (PDF) Vanadium Share and discover research
Vanadium (chemical symbol,V) is a dblock transition metal,silver in color,appearing in the first long period of the periodic table between titanium and chromium.Richmond VMo JV Project Intermin Resources LtdCompanies including CSR,CRA,ESSO and Fimiston Mining also identified significant vanadium and molybdenum mineralisation in the upper oxide zone from surface where the oil shale had been leached of the oil and enriched by vanadium,molybdenum,copper,nickel and other metals.

Nickel deposits are generally found in two forms,either as sulfide or laterite.Sulfide type nickel deposits are formed in essentially the same manner as platinum deposits.Nickel is a chalcophile element which prefers sulfides,so an ultramafic or mafic rock which has a sulfide phase in the magma may form nickelFactors controlling the proportionality of vanadium toEhpH diagrams offer an explanation of the factors controlling their proportionality and its relationship with S contents.Three EhpH regimes are proposed for the natural system.Regime I represents conditions under which Ni +2 is available for bonding and vanadium is unavailable because of its quinquivalent state.Crude oils expelled from
