## Efflorescence Causes,Removal,and Prevention
Efflorescence is a crystaline deposit on surfaces of masonry,stucco or concrete.It is whitish in appear­ance,and is sometimes referred to as "whiskers".Ultrasonic Dispersing and Wet milling of Calcium Carbonate.For over 20 years,it has been well documented that finely ground calcite (calcium carbonate,CaCO 3) can penetrate the pores between cement particles and accelerate the hydration of minerals [2],modulate cement settling time [3] and promote the generation of strong and space filling hydrates (mono hemicarboaluminate hydrates and ettringite [4.
