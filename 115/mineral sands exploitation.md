Mineral Resources: Definition,Types,Use and Exploitation! Definition: Minerals provide the material used to make most of the things of industrial based society roads,cars,computers,fertilizers,etc.Demand for minerals is increasing world wide as the population increases and the consumption demands of individual people increase.Mineral resources South African Governmentheavy mineral sands contain ilmenite,rutile and zircon.The potential of shale gas exploration and exploitation provides an opportunity for South Africa to begin exploring the production of its own fuel and marks the beginning of the reindustrialisation of the economy.

## MINERAL EXPLORATION AND MINE DEVELOPMENT
Mineral exploration and development are informationgathering activities.In this sense,mineral exploration and development represent a variety of activities that collect information necessary to identify mineral deposits and then evaluate whether they should developed into mines.Eramet Activities Explore &amp Produce: from extaction toMineral sands: in Senegal,we're exploiting a mineral sands deposit by continuous dredging.The world's largest mining dredge operates in an artificial basin in the country,vacuuming the sand 24 hours a day.Lithium: by 2021 we will be exploiting a vast deposit of this metal of the future near Salta,Argentina.
