## Case Study Flowsheets: Copper Gold Concentrate Treatment
The conventional treatment of copper concentrates by this method works well and recovers copper and precious metals as highvalue products.The conventional treatment of copper gold concentrates does have some compelling reasons to seek an alternative hydrometallurgical process for recovery of concentrate values.These include the following: 1.Dynamic Simulation of Processing High Arsenic,DYNAMIC SIMULATION OF PROCESSING HIGH ARSENIC COPPER CONCENTRATES IN A FLUIDIZED BED ROASTER,Block diagram of copper concentrate roasting plant,Dynamic Simulation of Processing High Arsenic Copper Concentrates in a Fluidized Bed Roaster.
