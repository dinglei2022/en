## Coal preparation plant Wikipedia
A coal preparation plant (CPP also known as a coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP),coal handling plant,prep plant,tipple or wash plant) is a facility that washes coal of soil and rock,crushes it into graded sized chunks (sorting),stockpiles grades preparing it for transport to market,and more often than not,also loads coal into rail cars,barges,or ships.Volume change behaviour of mixtures of coarse coal rejectAbstractCodisposal of finegrained wastes or tailings and coarsegrained wastes or coarse reject generated on the processing of the runofmine coal,offers potential economic,geotechnical and environmental advantages over conventional separate disposal practices.To evaluate the compressibility behaviour and performance of coarse reject,tailings and mixtures of coarse reject and tailings
