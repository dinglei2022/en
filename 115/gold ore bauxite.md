## Bauxite Wikipedia
Australia is the largest producer of bauxite,followed by China.In 2017,China was the top producer of aluminium with almost half of the world's production,followed by Russia,Canada,and India.Although aluminium demand is rapidly increasing,known reserves of its bauxite ore are sufficient to meet the worldwide demands for aluminium for many centuries.Alcoa BauxiteAlcoa has ownership in seven active bauxite mines globally and operates four of them,making us among the largest bauxite producers in the world.We have access to large bauxite deposits with mining rights that extend in most cases more than 20 years.Our global network is strategically loed near key Atlantic and Pacific markets.
