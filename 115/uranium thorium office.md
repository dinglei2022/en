## Thoriumbased nuclear power Wikipedia
2019911&ensp&#0183&enspThoriumbased nuclear power generation is fueled primarily by the nuclear fission of the isotope uranium233 produced from the fertile element thorium.According to proponents,a thorium fuel cycle offers several potential advantages over a uranium fuel cycle—including much greater abundance of thorium on Earth,superior physical and nuclear fuel properties,and reduced nuclear waste production.The delusion of thorium Beyond Nuclear InternationalThe DOE Office of Environmental Management now considers the disposal of this uranium233 to be 'an unfunded mandate'.Thorium reactors also produce uranium232,which decays to an extremely potent highenergy gamma emitter that can penetrate through one metre of concrete,making the handling of this spent nuclear fuel extraordinarily
