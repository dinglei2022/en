## Soil Improvement Techniques Online International Journal
OIL REPLACEMENT.Soil replacement is one of the oldest and simplest methods which improve the bearing soil conditions.The foundation condition can be improved by replacing poor soil (eg.organic soils and medium or soft clay) with more competent materials such as sand,gravel or crushed stone as well,nearly any soil can be used in fills.
