## Cyclone Separators Selection Guide Engineering360
Cyclone separators utilize gravity and a vortex to remove particulates from gaseous streams.Industrial cyclones are used in pollution control appliions most commonly as a first stage,lower cost method for removing larger particulate matter (PM) from effluent gas streams.How to Improve Cyclone SeparationGood cyclone separation depends upon control of pressure drop,pulp density and apex size.The 'pressure drop' may vary but should not change rapidly,and is held at safe levels by keeping an adequate sump level.A falling sump level causes cavitation in the pump and reduction in feed rate pressure drop in the cyclone falls and solids report increasingly to the overflow until the drop

## Particle Adhesion in Cyclone Particle Separators IntechOpen
1.Introduction.Cyclone particle separators (in short for cyclone) are widely used in the particle processing technology.A typical cyclone consists of a tangential inlet,a cone shape body,and a vortex finder at the top centre,as shown in Figure 1.The particleladen flow enters the cyclone through the rectangular tangential inlet,forming a swirling flow.Separation processes processdesignSeparation processes are based on the theory of vaporliquid equilibrium.This theory states that streams leaving a stage in a separation process are in equilibrium with one another.The idea of equilibrium revolves around the idea that when there is vapor and liquid in contact with one another they are in constantly vaporizing and condensing.
