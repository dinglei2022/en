## Jetti Resources A technology driven natural resources
The Jetti technology is especially advantaged for extracting copper from lowgrade primary sulfides,the world's most abundant copper resource.The alytic technology seamlessly integrates with existing heap leaching methods and downstream processing operations.Bioleaching WikipediaBioleaching is the extraction of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms.This is much cleaner than the traditional heap leaching using cyanide.Bioleaching is one of several appliions within biohydrometallurgy and several methods are used to recover copper,zinc,lead,arsenic,antimony,nickel,molybdenum,gold,silver,and cobalt.
