## THE OPTIMAL BALL DIAMETER IN A MILL
and with the decreased grain size,the necessary ball size also decreases (Olejnik,2010; 2011).For each grain size there is an optimal ball size (Trumic et.al.2007).The bigger ball in relation to the optimal one will have an excess energy,and consequently,the smaller ball mill has less energy necessary for grinding.In bothBall End Mills MSCDirectBall end mills,also known as ball nose end mills,are used for milling contoured surfaces,slotting and pocketing.A ball end mill is constructed of a round cutting

## Ball Mill
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore.The balls are initially 5 10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds.The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol. % ore and 25% steel.The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle size measurement device and size control cyclones.Size Reduction Eriez Lab Equipment30 Innes Road (cnr Graniet Rd),Jet Park Ext.66 Boksburg,Gauteng South Africa
