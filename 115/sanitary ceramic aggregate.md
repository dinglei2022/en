## Characterization of Concrete made with Recycled Aggregate
Characterization of Concrete made with Recycled Aggregate from Ceramic Sanitary Ware This study examined the possibility of reusing the ceramic wastes of sanitary ware as coarse aggregate,in partial substitution (15,20 y 25 %) of natural coarse aggregates.Nanotol Nanotechnology simplifies your lifeNanotol is No.1 NanoSealant Much more than a beading effect.Sealed surfaces stay clean and protected for a long time.Sustainable nano care instead of cleaning.
