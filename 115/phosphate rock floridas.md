## Phosphate and How Florida Was Formed
A "hard rock" phosphate reserve in North Central Florida was discovered next.Thus began Florida's phosphate mining industry.Florida's phosphate mining today accounts for about 80% of the phosphate used in the United States,as well as about 25% of the phosphate used around the world.Mosaic Florida Phosphate Operations: Hillsborough,PolkFlorida is home to our phosphate operations headquarters and many of our phosphate production facilities.From our mines to our offices,we are committed to being a great place to work,a responsible corporate citizen,a committed environmental steward,and a respected community partner.

## Mineral Resource of the Month: Phosphate Rock EARTH
Mining first began in the United States in 1867 in South Carolina.Phosphate rock was discovered in central Florida in the 1880s,and because of the extensive,highquality deposits and lower mining cost,it quickly became the leading phosphateproducing state.Currently,phosphate rock is mined in Florida,Idaho,North Carolina and Utah.Mining The Phosphate RiskIn Florida,the phosphate rock is extracted by a process referred to as stripmining.Unlike mining in other states,phosphate deposits are found closer to the surface,about 3040 feet below ground.Sandy topsoil,also known as overburden,is removed by large digging machines called draglines.

Florida also has a considerable mining industry thanks to phosphate,natural gas and petroleum resources.Phosphates from the state are ground up and used as fertilizer.In the 1990s,mining of natural gas,petroleum and phosphates provided $1.5 billion to Florida's overall economy.Phosphate Rock Minerals Eduion CoalitionPhosphate Rock.The term phosphate rock (or phosphorite) is used to denote any rock with high phosphorus content.The largest and least expensive source of phosphorus is obtained by mining and concentrating phosphate rock from the numerous phosphate deposits of the world.
