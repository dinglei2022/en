## Size Evaluation of Gold Nanoparticles by UV−vis Spectroscopy
We present a method for the evaluation of the average size of gold nanoparticles based on the fitting of their UV−vis spectra by the Mie model for spheres.The method gives good results using a calibration of the dumping frequency of the surface plasmon resonance and accounting for the presence of nonspherical AuNP in solution by the Gans model for spheroids.WIC Thesis Course Information Department of PhysicsPH403 THESIS,The writingintensive course (WIC) for physics majors.Possible Projects for 2020 2021 are at this link.PowerPoint slides from the Senior Thesis presentation on 12 November 2019.
