Gradations and capacities are most often based on a typi&#173;cal,well graded choke feed to the crusher.Well graded feed is considered to be 90% to 100% passing the closed side feed opening,40% to 60% passing the midpoint of the crushing chamber on the closed side (average of the closed side feed opening and closed side setting),and 0 to 10%.Aggregate Handling Best PracticesStockpile gradations Bulk specific gravity Consensus aggregate properties.• What is the minimum amount cold feed bin can consistently feed?.from the RAP crusher: Milled material typically has 4 8% more fines ( 200’s) than processed (crushed) RAP.

The crushers are the determinant of the percent cubical aggregate processed.The best option is to feed crushed,cubical material to the screen,and let the screen decks size the different particles into the desired cubical gradations.The crusher needs to be the device that controls the amount of elongated product in the feed,not the screen.Make the Grade with VSI Crushing Aggregates ManagerMake the Grade with VSI Crushing.Staff Report.October 1,2013.VSI crushers feature a hopper to feed the unit and a rotor impact system inside that does the actual fracturing of the material.These crushers are ideal for appliions where a consistent cubicle product in a high quantity is a necessity,such as the production of aggregate
