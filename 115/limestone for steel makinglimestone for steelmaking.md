## Basic oxygen steelmaking Wikipedia
Basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS,BOP,BOF,or OSM),also known as Linz Donawitzsteelmaking or the oxygen converter process is a method of primary steelmaking in which carbonrich molten pig iron is made into steel.Blowing oxygen through molten pig iron lowers the carbon content of the alloy and changes it into lowcarbon steel.limestone for steelmaking dojokunvda.itSteel Production limestone for steelmaking,Today,steel production comes from both recycled as well as the tradition raw materials,iron ore,coal and limestone.Contact Supplier Decomposition behavior of limestone in early converter slag.

## The Bessemer Process and Modern Steelmaking
Steel still hadn't proved yet to be a structural metal and the production was both slow and costly.This changed in 1856 when Henry Bessemer discovered a process that had an effective way to add oxygen to molten iron that reduced the carbon content.This was also the same year that Sabel Steel was founded.Steel Openhearth steelmaking BritannicaSteel Openhearth steelmaking: Though it has been almost completely replaced by BOF and EAF steelmaking in many highly industrialized countries,the open hearth nevertheless accounts for about onesixth of all steel produced worldwide.The openhearth furnace (OHF) uses the heat of combustion of gaseous or liquid fuels to convert a charge of scrap and liquid blastfurnace iron to liquid steel.

## Advantages of Electric Arc Furnace for Steelmaking
A typical steelmaking arc furnace is the source of steel for a minimill,which may make bars or strip product.Minimills can be sited relatively near to the markets for steel products,and the transport requirements are less than for an integrated mill,which would commonly be sited near a harbour for access to shipping.Steelmaking: An investor's guide to the raw materials andKey raw materials in steelmaking.Iron ore,steel scrap,and coal are three main raw materials for steelmaking.150 kg of coal,and 43 kg of limestone to produce a ton of steel.It accounts for 60% of steel production in the U.S.As this process uses mainly steel scrap,the cost of production is affected by steel scrap prices.
