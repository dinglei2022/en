## Viscosity Index Improvers Market Global Industry
Introduction: Viscosity Index Improvers Market.Viscosity is considered to be a key factor for the measuring of quality of a lubricant.Viscosity is the quantity for expressing the magnitude of the internal friion of the fluid whereas,viscosity index determines the extent of viscosity of the hydraulic fluid which can change with the temperature as the viscosity index improves there mayViscosity Modifiers Index ImproversAbout Viscosity The viscosity of a lubricant is influenced by changes in its temperature.Oil's viscosity index provides an indiion of its potential for appliion of a wide temperature range.Viscosity index improvers (VII) are widely used in the lubricant field,although engine oils
