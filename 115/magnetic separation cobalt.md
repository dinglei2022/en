A magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic field.This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials,such as iron,and attracts or repels other magnets.A permanent magnet is an object made from a material that is magnetized and creates its own persistent magnetic field.Manufacturer for innovative magnetic separation technologyThe power of progress and technical tradition can be felt in each and every one of our STEINERT solutions for magnetic and sensorbased sorting and separation.We offer the latest in technologies available to the mining and mineral processing industries,including our multisensor ore sorting solutions.
