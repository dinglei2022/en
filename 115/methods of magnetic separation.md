## Magnetic Separation an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Magnetic separation: based on the generation of magnetic forces on the particles to be separated,which are higher than opposing forces such as gravity or centrifugal forces.This principle is used to separate ferromagnetic particles from crushed scrap mixtures.• Eddy current separation: is a particular form of magnetic separation.An(DOC) Magnetic separation Hamza Achache Academia.eduA much higher recovery and grade were obtained using a magnetic separation unit and magnetite (ferromagnetic material) compared to the results of gravity separation.Discussion: Magnetic separation is widely used in industries and is directly linked to the magnetic susceptibility of the material used.
