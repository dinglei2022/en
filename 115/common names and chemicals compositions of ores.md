## How Are Metals Extracted From Their Ores? Reference
How Are Metals Extracted From Their Ores? Metal extraction from ores occurs in many different ways involving physical,chemical and electrical means.Even ores of the same metal sometimes require different methods of separation depending on the concentration of the metal and its chemical composition within the ore.Pyrite Mineral Uses and PropertiesPyrite is a brassyellow mineral with a bright metallic luster.It has a chemical composition of iron sulfide (FeS 2) and is the most common sulfide mineral.It forms at high and low temperatures and occurs,usually in small quantities,in igneous,metamorphic,and sedimentary rocks worldwide.Pyrite is so common that many geologists would
