## Closed Circuit Grinding VS Open Circuit Grinding
Open circuit grinding consists of one or more grinding mills,either parallel or in series,that discharges a final ground product without classification equipment and no return of coarse discharge back to the mill.Some very simplistic examples of open circuit grinding are see belowProcess equipment Our equipment MillsBall mills can be designed to operate continuously (fed at one end of the system and discharged at the other),or on a batch basis for smaller,or intermittent volumes.They can also be operated either on a stand alone basis (‘open circuit grinding’) or in conjunction with a classifier which returns oversize product to the mill for further.
