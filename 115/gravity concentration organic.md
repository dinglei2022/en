## How to Convert Specific Gravity to Pounds Per Gallon
Apr 19,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Since specific gravity is a ratio of the density of a solid or liquid to the density of water,all you have to do to find the density,given the specific gravity,is to multiply the specific gravity by the density of water.If you're looking for density in pounds per gallon,you need to know the density of water at 4 degrees Celsius.Specific gravity physics BritannicaSpecific gravity: Specific gravity,ratio of the density of a substance to that of a standard substance.The usual standard of comparison for solids and liquids is water at 4 &#176C (39.2 &#176F),which has a density of 1.0 kg per litre (62.4 pounds per cubic foot).Gases are commonly compared with dry air,which has a

## Standard Test Methods for Specific Gravity of Soil Solids
Abstract.These test methods cover the determination of the specific gravity of soil solids passing a sieve by means of a water pycnometer.Soil solids for these test methods do not include solids which can be altered by these methods,contaminated with a substance that prohibits the use of these methods,or are highly organic soil solids,such as fibrous matter which floats in water.Sludge Volume Weight RelationshipsSludge Volume Weight Relationships The volume of sludge depends on two items: # water content # solids content Furthermore,the solid content is a function of fixed and volatile soils.Therefore,the specific gravity of all the solid matter is described by: where M s = mass of solids,kg S s = overall specific gravity of solids D w = density
