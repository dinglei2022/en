## Gold extraction Wikipedia
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing,resulting in direct recovery ofHOW TO GET GOLD FROM IRON PYRITE !!!

The mineral pyrite ( ˈ p aɪ r aɪ t ),or iron pyrite,also known as fool's gold,is an iron sulfide with the chemical formula FeS 2 (iron(II) disulfide).Pyrite is considered the most common of the sulfide minerals.Pyrite's metallic luster and pale brassyellow hue give it a superficial resemblance to gold,hence the wellknown nicknameMineral Extraction The Environmental Literacy CouncilA disadvantage to this method is that it can leave a large amount of mineral in place.Longwall mining allows for increased mineral extraction to occur,since it shears entire blocks of mineral onto a conveyor belt through the use of selfadvancing,hydraulic roof supports or shields.
