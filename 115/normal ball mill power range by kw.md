## Horsepower Wikipedia
Horsepower (hp) is a unit of measurement of power,or the rate at which work is done.There are many different standards and types of horsepower.Two common definitions being used today are the mechanical horsepower (or imperial horsepower),which is about 745.7 watts,and the metric horsepower,which is approximately 735.5 watts.The term was adopted in the late 18th century by ScottishCALCULATION OF THE POWER DRAW OF DRYof the Bond ball mill grindability test.For all model based methods,a reliable method to calculate mill power draw for a given mill is required for the calculation of power draw.Morrell (1996) proposed a mathematical model for autogenous,semiautogenous and ball mills which is based on the motion of grinding charge inside the mill.
