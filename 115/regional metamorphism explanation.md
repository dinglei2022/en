## Metamorphic rock Simple English Wikipedia,the free
Regional metamorphism,or dynamic metamorphism,occurs in great masses of rock.Rocks can be metamorphosed just by being at great depths below the Earth's surface.There they get high temperatures and the great weight of the rock layers above.Much of the lower continental crust is metamorphic,except for recent igneous intrusions.Regional Metamorphism an overview ScienceDirect TopicsRegional metamorphism occurs over broad areas in the lithosphere,possibly influenced by the heat supply.Regional metamorphic rock results from regional metamorphism and usually develops a flaky texture.The best explanation for the anomalously low Na K ratio in the lower part of the section is the decomposition of the primary plagioclase

Regional Metamorphism is a kind of metamorphism that depicts the texture of rocks due to deep burial and heating.It is associated with the largescale forces of plate tectonics.Generally,it occurs in large areas that do not have any relationship with igneous bodies.The process is carried under nonhydrostatic and differential stress conditions.Origin of Regional Barrovian Metamorphism in Hot BackarcsNov 20,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32I have proposed an explanation for Barrovian metamorphism,one of the Earth's most common regional metamorphic series.I argue that the high temperatures responsible for the metamorphism occur in subduction zone backarcs prior to and not as a result of continental collision orogeny or other deformation events.
