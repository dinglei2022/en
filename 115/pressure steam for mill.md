In order to assess blowing effectiveness,blow steam may be directed onto a target plate in the main steam line.This practice is most common in highpressure boilers generating superheated steam for a turbine drive.Successive blows are made until solid particle erosion isSteam turbine generator Stal,backpressure 3 bar,28 MWThe input steam pressure before Sventile : 61 kg cm2 Max Pressure Continuous : 69 kg cm2 Back pressure steam : 4 kg cm2 Steam temperature : 485&#176C.Incoming steam 61 69bar,485 o C.Back pressure 3bar Speed 3000rpm Generators 2pcs,20000kVA,cos 0,75

## Steaming Milk ChefSteps
Steaming milk may seem simple,but it’s remarkably difficult to do well.The key is to remember that there are two phases to steaming: aerating,which baristas call “stretching”; and emulsifying,which baristas call “texturing.” You need both to have a creamy,velvety batch of milk with enough body to create latte art or a great cappuccino.Measuring Paper Machine Energy PerformanceDifferential pressure (especially for early dryers) Steam valve positions for water heating Basis weight versus standard Press solids usually requires grab sampl Press section weir flows Size press starch solids Pocket ventilation temperature Temperatures through hood exhaust heat recovery systems Warm water flow from pulp mill
