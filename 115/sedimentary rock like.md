## Sedimentary Rocks: Meaning,Composition and Weathering
10.Weathering of Sedimentary Rocks: Sedimentary rocks are attacked by the same weathering agents (mechanical and chemical) that acted on igneous rocks,but with different results since the sediments themselves become the products of weathering.We know conglomerates are composed of any kind of rock or mineral.What does sedimentary rock look like answersSedimentary rocks are usually layered if you look at the side of a sedimentary rock,you should be able to see thin layers that look like lines.Sedimentary rocks are one of the best types of

Sedimentary rocks are second most common of the three types of rocks found on the planet while igneous rocks happen to be the most common rock type.On the basis of their composition,sedimentary rocks are egorized into three different types 'clastic sedimentary rocks','chemical sedimentary rocks' and 'organic sedimentary rocks'.Sedimentary Rock Formation: Yummy Sediments!These rocks don't have crystals because they don't come from molten lava.If you see bands or layering in a rock,rounded grains and it chips easily,it is likely sedimentary.Make Some Yummy Sediments! This is a great activity that reinforces the basic concepts of how sedimentary rock is formed.

ReferenceHow Are Sedimentary Rocks Formed? Sedimentary rocks are formed from preexisting rock through the combined processes of weathering,transportation,deposition,compacting and cementation.The entire series of processes is known as lithifiion,and the weathering portion of the process can be either mechanical or chemical.

## Sedimentary Rock: Types and How They Are Formed? Rocks
Rocks are generally grouped into igneous,metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.Sedimentary rocks are usually well exposed on the earth's surface and in water bodies as well.Rock materials from preexisting rocks (such as metamorphic,igneous and previously shaped sedimentary rocks) that have been eroded,weathered and compacted over time,makeSedimentary Rocks Tulane UniversitySedimentary Rocks.Rivers,oceans,winds,and rain runoff all have the ability to carry the particles washed off of eroding rocks.Such material,called detritus,consists of fragments of rocks and minerals.When the energy of the transporting current is not strong enough to carry these particles,the particles drop out in the process of sedimentation.
