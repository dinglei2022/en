## Belt Conveyor Dynamic Characteristics and Influential Factors
This paper uses the KelvinVoigt viscoelastic model to establish the continuous dynamic equations for tail hammer tension belt conveyors.The viscoelastic continuity equations are solved using the generalized coordinate method.We analyze various factors influencing longitudinal vibration of the belt conveyor by simulation and propose a control strategy to limit the vibration.Safeguard Calculated Emissions Baseline Basis of Preparationoverland conveyors,and Safeguard Calculated Emissions Baseline Basis of Preparation Environment Rev Document Number Author Approver BFO Issue Date Page 0 OPREP00445 J Dickson John Wynne 30 10 2017 10of 24 2 Purpose and Scope
