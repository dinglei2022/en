## Bauxite: The principal ore of aluminum.Geology
Bauxite is the primary ore of aluminum.Almost all of the aluminum that has ever been produced has been extracted from bauxite.The United States has a few small bauxite deposits but at least 99% of the bauxite used in the United States is imported.The UnitedMARKET RELEASE 24th UPDATE PRIMARY OREprocessing facility.CuDeco metallurgists conclude the result demonstrates that the Rocklands primary ore is amenable to high recovery and as having good metallurgical characteristics for processing through flotation treatment.The testwork revealed no issues with processing the ore
