## What happens when carbonic acid reacts with calcium carbonate?
Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3) Or,if there is more acid,two hydrogen ions will react with a carbonate to form carbonic acid H2CO3 which will decompose to form carbon dioxide CO2 which eventually bubbles off into the atmosphere,and water H2OOmyaWeb Precipitated Calcium CarbonatePrecipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) is produced by precipitating a calcium salt out of a solution under defined conditions.Normally,a filtered solution of calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 (from burnt lime) is used as the calcium source.This must not contain any colored impurities.Calcium carbonate is precipitated by the admixture of gaseous carbon dioxide or sodium carbonate Na2CO3.
