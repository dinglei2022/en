The pellet ore is divided into acid pellet ore and alkaline pellet ore.Since acid pellet ore production and operation is easily controlled,and the pellet has high grade and intensity,and blast furnace also need both acid pellet ore and high alkalinity sinter ore for smelting,so various countries mainly produce acid pelletRealizing state of the art “All Indian Pellet plant” by MECONcondition & minimizing project cost It is expected that MECON’s state of art “All Indian Pellet plant” based on Travelling grate (TG) process will meet the above demand Two major process routes ie Travelling Grate (TG) & Grate Kiln (GK) process are adopted worldwide for pellet production where in,TG process has some edge over GK process
