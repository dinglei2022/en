## The Suitability of Groundwater for Domestic and Irrigation
The average concentrations (mg L) of Ca2+ ions in groundwater loed on migmatite,granite and charnockitic terrains were 36.67,24.63 and 10.98 respectively while those for Mg2+ were 9.94,7.48 and 4.57.The order of ion abundance was Na+&gt K+ &gt Ca2+&gt Mg2+.Phyllosilies Tulane UniversityMost phyllosilies contain hydroxyl ion,OH,with the OH loed at the center of the 6 membered rings,as shown here.Thus,the group becomes Si 2 O 5 (OH)3.When other ions are bonded to the SiO 4 sheets,they share the apical oxygens and the (OH) ions which bond to the other ions in octahedral coordination.
