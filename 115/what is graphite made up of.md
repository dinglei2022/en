## Graphite: A mineral with extreme properties and many uses
Graphite From Coal Seam Metamorphism ("Amorphous" Graphite) Some graphite forms from the metamorphism of coal seams The organic material in coal is composed mainly of carbon,oxygen,hydrogen,nitrogen,and sulfur The heat of metamorphism destroys the organic molecules of coal,volatilizing the oxygen,hydrogen,nitrogen,and sulfurGraphene &amp Graphite How Do They Compare? GrapheneaIt is found naturally in three different forms: crystalline flake,amorphous and lump or vein graphite,and depending on its form,is used for a number of different appliions.As previously touched upon,graphite has a planar,layered structure each layer being made up of carbon atoms linked together in a hexagonal lattice.
