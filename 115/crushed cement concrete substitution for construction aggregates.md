INTRODUCTION.Reclaimed concrete material (RCM) can be used as coarse and or fine aggregate in Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements.However,concrete incorporating more than about 10 to 20 percent fine RCM aggregates can suffer a reduction in quality because of the high amount of water required to maintain adequate workability of the concrete mix.Aggregates cementCrushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock,boulders,cobbles,or largesize gravel.Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases,soilcement,and in new concrete.After harvesting,aggregate is processed: crushed,screened,and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.

Aggregates are the most mined material in the world.Construction aggregate is a broad egory of granular raw material of different sizes (sand,gravel,crushed stone,slag,recycled concrete etc) used in construction.Aggregate can be used in a number of ways in construction.In roads and railway ballast the aggregates are used to resist the overall (staticLimestone Vs.Crushed Concrete eHowLimestone vs.Crushed Concrete.In its pure form,limestone differs significantly from crushed concrete in that the former constitutes a naturally formed rock found in marine environments and the other a manmade construction material.Limestone may appear in crushed concrete as a material found in the cement used to mix concrete.
