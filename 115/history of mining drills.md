## THE HISTORY OF DOWNTHEHOLE DRILLING AND THE
Airflushed drilling with top hammers began in the mining industry in Sweden in 1873,while downthehole (DTH) drills,again with air flush (and activation) became operational in 1950.During that same interval,Simon Ingersoll had patented the first steampowered,top hammer rock drill to provide higher productivity in blast hole drilling.History EpirocEpiroc's history began in 1873 when the company then called Atlas was founded in Stockholm,Sweden.Epiroc and Atlas Copco share their history until June 18,2018,when Epiroc was distributed to Atlas Copco's shareholders and became a standalone listed company.

## Jackleg rock drills used in Bisbee Arizona
If the drill steel breaks at a point that is not inside the hole the drill will go out of control.In mining things are never perfect,the length of the leg will often be too long or too short to effectively drill.To defeat this problem Bisbee had Jacklegs made with shortened legs.History How To Use Jackleg DrillThe Jackleg has a long history dating back to the Industrial Revolution.The Jackleg became one of the most common machines used in most mining operations because it allowed for increases in production that were unheard of at that time.The Jackleg was much lighter,easier handling,and faster to set up and drill than any of the previous drills.
