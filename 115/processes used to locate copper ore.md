## geology How do geologists find ore deposits? Earth
Many methods used a century ago are still in use,but with the addition of refinements.So looking at how large and small deposits were found will change over time.(Simple example of that would be that Romans and their contemporaries didn't use geophysics,but they did find major copper deposits in Spain.) Deposits are getting harder to find.123 Primary Copper Smelting123 Primary Copper Smelting 1231 General1 Copper ore is produced in 13 stat In 1989,Arizona produced 60 percent of the total,Pyrometallurgical techniques use heat to separate copper from copper sulfide ore concentrat Process steps include mining,concentration,roasting,smelting,converting,and finally fire and electrolytic.
