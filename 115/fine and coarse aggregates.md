## A Detailed Guide on Grading of Aggregates.civilseek
Grading of Aggregates.Grading of aggregates is determining the average grain size of the aggregates before they are used in construction.This is applied to both coarse and fine aggregates.The aggregate sample is sieved through a set of sieves and weights retainedCoarse Aggregate Specific Gravity Pavement InteractiveThe coarse aggregate specific gravity test (Figure 1) is used to calculate the specific gravity of a coarse aggregate sample by determining the ratio of the weight of a given volume of aggregate to the weight of an equal volume of water.It is similar in nature to the fine aggregate specific gravity test.
