## (PDF) Development of Conveyor Belts Design for Reducing,
The work utilizes models to predict the motion resistance of belt conveyors that take into consideration the influence of key conveyor variables,such as,Pipe Conveyors for Infrastructure Projects Innovative …Idler spacing is to be kept lower for pipe conveyors in order to maintain the shape of the pipe.This drastically increases the number of idlers and brackets (Table 5),which in turn has significant effects on the cost of the conveyor.

## The significance of the design of conveyor idler spacing
he belt conveyor is composed of the driving pulley,bend pulley,idlers,driving device and the conveyor belt and so on,the idler is the most widely used and distributed component of belt conveyor,generally distributed throughout the whole belt conveyor,and its mass accounts for about 1 3 of the whole belt conveyor,therefore,the reasonable spacing of idlers is set can,Analytical Model between Power and Idler Spacing of Belt.Abstract: The effects of idler spacing selection on belt conveyor power consumption have been discussed.A mathematical model to analyze the relation between total life cycle cost and belt,idler sets and driver units is presented,which is a way of reducing belt conveyor investment costs.
