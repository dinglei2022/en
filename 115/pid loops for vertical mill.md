## PID controller Wikipedia
A proportional integral derivative controller (PID controller or three term controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism widely used in industrial.How Does a PID Controller Work?PID,(Proportional Integral Derivative Controller) is a control loop mechanism.It's structure and tuning is widely used in industrial control applications.Zeigler Nichols method: Zeigler Nichols proposed closed loop methods for tuning the PID controller.Those are continuous cycling method and damped oscillation method.

The roller mill is an air swept vertical ring roll with an integral classification system.A vertical shaft rotates a “spider” assembly of arms from which are suspended free swinging journal assemblies with rolls attached.As the unit turns,centrifugal force drives the rolls against the inner surface of the vertical grinding ring.Plows rotating with the assembly lift feed material from.Critical Room Control CRCCritical Room Control is the leading innovator of safe energy efficient critical environment solutions.With intuitive user interface devices,open logic controllers,and closed loop technology we verify that every CRC system is actually delivering what it supposed to.
