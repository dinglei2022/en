## Cement kiln Wikipedia
Cement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of Portland and other types of hydraulic cement,in which calcium carbonate reacts with silicabearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silies.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year,and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity usually defines the capacity of the cement plant.Cement : Manufacture,Chemical Composition,Heat of HydrationManufacture of Portland Cement The dry process : The quarried clay and limestone are crushed separately until nothing bigger than a tennis ball remains.Samples of both rocks are then sent off to the laboratory for mineral analysis.If necessary,minerals
