## Energy in Iran Wikipedia
Iran has recoverable coal reserves of nearly 1.9bn short tonnes.The country produces about 1.3m short tonnes of coal annually and consumes about 1.5m short tonnes,making it a small net importer of coal.Demographic trends and intensified industrialization have caused electric power demand to grow by 8 percent per year.NSW coalfields NSW Resources and GeoscienceNSW recoverable coal reserves total over 7 billion tonnes and include those resources where conceptual mine planning has been undertaken,in both Mining Leases and Exploration Licence areas.Coal mines in NSW produced a record 194 Mt of saleable coal in 2017 18 worth around $22 billion.

World Coal AssociationReserves that are not only considered to be recoverable but can also be recovered economically.This means they take into account what current mining technology can achieve and the economics of recovery.Proved reserves will therefore change according to the price of coal if the price of coal is low,proved reserves will decrease.
