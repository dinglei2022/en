The amount packed depends on the individual atoms' volumes these volumes,in turn,depends on their atomic radius.Atomic radius increases down a group,so the volume of the atoms also increases.Fewer sodium atoms than lithium atoms,therefore,can be packed into a given volume.However,as the atoms become larger,their masses increase.A question of timing Explore physicsThe atomic clocks on board GPS satellites use the element caesium and work by exposing the caesium atoms to microwave radiation.This causes the atoms to vibrate at their resonant frequency which is so predictable we can use it to tell the time.Watch The Great Relativity Show,a
