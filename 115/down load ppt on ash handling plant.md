## Custom designed,Efficient Ash Handling Equipment
Ash handling equipment is one of the most crucial links in the solid fuel,biomass boiler,and combustion systems chain.Located in plants around the world,ash handling systems are set up in harsh environments where they endure intense temperatures.Efficiency of a Coal Fired Boiler in a Typical Thermal.The whole world is in the grip of energy crisis and the increased pollution associated with energy use.A power plant is assembly of systems or subsystems to generate and deliver mechanical or electrical energy.The primary units of a coal fired thermal power plant (Figure 1) are fuel handling system,boiler,turbine and generator and cooling.

## How Does a Coal Power Plant Work?
Thermal based power plants can produce electricity from coal or other fuel sources.The coal fired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption.Coal fired power plants,while producing power,require a lot of water and produce a lot of pollutants like ash and CO2.STORAGE,STACKING AND HANDLING PRACTICES2017 9 29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Storage,Stacking and Handling Practices.Chapter 2.Bangladesh National Building Code 2012.7 15.During monsoon and for storage for more than 2 months,the stack shall be kept completely enclosed by a waterproofing membrane such as polyethylene sheet which shall close on top of the sack.Care should be taken

## Ash Handling Systems Nederman National Conveyors
Ash handling systems may employ different forms of pneumatic ash conveying or mechanical ash conveyors.A typical ash handling system may employ vacuum pneumatic ash collection with ash conveying from several ash pick up stations and resulting in delivery to an ash storage silo for interim holding prior to load out for disposal or reuse.
