## Rate of Strength Gain of Concrete Concrete Strength Over.
Strength can be defined as ability to resist change.One of the most valuable properties of the concrete is its strength.Strength is most important parameter that gives the picture of overall quality of concrete.Strength of concrete usually directly related to cement paste.Many factors influence the rate at which the strength of concrete increases after mixing.
