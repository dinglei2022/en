## Extraction of metals Iron Wikiversity
Iron is extracted from its ore,haematite,by reduction with carbon.This takes place in a blast furnace (named after blasts of air [20% oxygen],heated to 1000 &#176C,which are blasted into the bottom of the furnace): A mixture of crushed iron ore,coke (an almost pure form of carbon) and limestone is fed into the top of the blast furnace.EXTRACTION OF IRON IN A BLAST FURNACE reductionEXTRACTION OF IRON IN A BLAST FURNACE Iron is also below carbon in the reactivity series,so therefore carbon can be used to reduce it (note: reduction can also mean to remove the oxygen from a compound).This is done in a blast furnace.

## Ways to Separate Metal From Ore Sciencing
The process of separating a metal from its ore is known as smelting.Smelting is widely practiced today and has a long history dating back to the Bronze Age,when ancient peoples first learned the technique.Smelting methods range from the basic to the hightech,and are applied to a variety of materials,including aluminum,iron and copper.Iron Ore Mining Techniques,Metal Extraction,Types ofIron ores are rocks and mineral deposits from which clanging iron can be reasonably extracted.Iron ore mining is classified into two egories manual mining and mechanized mining methods.Haematite and magnetite are the most commonly found iron ore minerals.Deposits of iron ore such as haematite containing iron oxide are found in sedimentary rocks from which the oxygen is removed from the
