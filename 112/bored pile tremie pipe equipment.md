## Bored Cast in Situ Concrete Pile,Its Construction and,
Bored cast in situ pile is ideal as end bearing pile,exclusively when it need to be socketed into rock When high capacity pile is required,then this type of pile is an ideal choice According to IS 2911 part 01 Section 02 2010,such type of pile preferred for weights ranges from 150tonnes to 300tonnUse Of Tremie To Concrete A Pile Under Fluid Martello PilingRotary Bored Piling Specialists 01476 570781 Search Menu Home,In the event that the tremie pipe has to be removed from the pile concrete before the pile has been completed,then the tremie pipe shall be reintroduced into the concrete by firstly closing the end of the tremie pipe with a steel end plug

## Method Statement of Bored Piles QA QC Construction
Jun 24,2018&#0183;&#32;Bored piles are constructed in the ground by boring in the circular shape of designed diameters to transfer load from the superstructure into the ground through friction and end bearing,Equipment,Tools,and Materials used,The tremie pipe will be inserted at the center of the pile The top of the tremie pipe will be.Tremie WikipediaA tremie is a watertight pipe,usually of about 250mm inside diameter (150 to 300 mm),with a conical hopper at its upper end above the water level.It may have a loose plug or a valve at the bottom end.A tremie is used to pour concrete underwater in a way that avoids washout of cement from the mix due to turbulent water contact with the concrete while it is flowing.
