## Will a Can of Coke Really Clean My Drains? Clog Busters
Oct 12,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32Because so many homeowners have had to resolve a drain issue,it's natural to hope that there is a better way.One thing the internet may tell you to try for fixing clogged drains: a can of CocaCola.Does Coke Unclog Drains? Sodas like Pepsi or CocaCola can clean the grime off of pipes because of their acidity.Coke Making Industrial Efficiency Technology &amp MeasuresCoke is a material with high carbon content and porosity.It has high resistance to breakage and low reactivity with gases,particularly CO2.Coke production is an important part of the integrated iron and steel plants using BFBOF route,acting as a reducing agent,as a source of thermal energy,and providing physical support for the burden in blast furnace.
