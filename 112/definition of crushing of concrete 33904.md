## CIP 35 Testing Compressive Strength of Concrete
The compressive strength of concrete is the most common performance measure used by the engineer in designing buildings and other structures.The compressive strength is measured by breaking cylindrical concrete specimens in a compressiontesting machine.Crusher Run: The Best Uses braenstoneDespite the fact that there are many ways in which crusher run can be used,one of its main functions is as a base or subbase filler.Contractors and homeowners may choose to use the material as a base layer beneath concrete and asphalt,or as the subbase for road systems and driveways.The material is preferable to soil because it isn't

## Crushing strength geology Britannica
The crushing strength of concrete,determined by breaking a cube,and often called the cube strength,reaches values of about 3 tons per square inch,that of granite 10 tons per square inch,and that of cast iron from 25 to 60 tons per square inch.Read More In materials testing: Static tension andProperties of concrete WikipediaFor practical immediate considerations,it is incumbent to accurately test the fundamental properties of concrete in its fresh,plastic state.Concrete is typically sampled while being placed,with testing protocols requiring that test samples be cured under laboratory conditions (standard cured).

The concrete cube test result will be satisfactory but the concrete in the structure would have a much lower strength.3.8.CONCRETE COMPACTION: Concrete ingredients when mixed have considerable amount of entrapped air depending on the workability.High workable mixes have lesser entrapped air than low workable mixes.The 28Day Myth National Precast Concrete AssociationOct 28,2013&nbsp&#0183&#32Concrete usually reaches 75% of the 28day strength at seven days.If your concrete is not reaching the proper 28day strength,I would troubleshoot each step of the process to determine why.Here are example questions you can ask: Q: Is the mix design correct? A high watercement ratio will result in a concrete with reduced strength.
