## Use of a tungsten filter to improve beam uniformity
The tungsten filter had a more pronounced beam hardening effect at the beam edge than along the central ray.For example,the dose rate in air at the beam edge for a 30 x 30 cm sup 2 field was 13% higher than along the central ray without the tungsten filter.(PDF) Use of tungsten material for the ITER divertorPDF Since the ITER divertor design includes tungsten monoblocks in the vertical target where heat loads are maximal,the design to protect leading edges as well as technology R&ampD for high

## Tungsten Element information,properties and uses
It seems to me that the name tungsten,or 'heavy stone',is justified by these appliions,which exploit its strength and density.I'm glad,though,that the birth of chemistry in the activity of those ancient metallurgists and mineralogists is still celebrated by the use of the symbol W for element 74.Tungsten: Properties,Production,Appliions &amp AlloysTungsten metal can be combined with other metals to increase their strength and resistance to wear and corrosion.Steel alloys often contain tungsten for these beneficial properties.Many highspeed steels — those used in cutting and machining tools like saw blades — contain around 18 percent tungsten.
