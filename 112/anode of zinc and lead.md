## Electrochemistry Chemistry for NonMajors
1.Zinc atoms from the zinc electrode are oxidized to zinc ions.This happens because zinc is higher than copper on the activity series and so is more easily oxidized.The electrode at which oxidation occurs is called the anode.The zinc anode gradually diminishes as the cell operates due to the loss of zincLead Anode,Lead Finished ProductThe lead anode is an anode that is made with the metal,lead.Lead anodes,however,are not made of pure lead and are more commonly made of metal alloys for better conduction of electricity and proper functioning in an electronic device.These kinds of anodes may not always have the same composition
