Lead is a chemical element with symbol Pb and atomic number 82.A heavy metal with a density exceeding that of most common materials,it is malleable and has a low melting point for a metal.Chemically,it is a relatively unreactive posttransition metal.Lead was known to prehistoric people.A principal ore of lead,galena,often bears silverSEDEX: The Biggest Lead and Zinc Deposits in the WorldSEDEX (SEDimentary Exhalative) deposits are one of several types of sedimenthosted leadzinc deposits.Rich accumulations of lead,zinc and silver are found in the ore minerals sphalerite (zinc sulfide) and galena (lead sulfide) deposited between thin layers of marine sand,silt and mud in sedimentary basins.
