## Magnetite Windows to the Universe
Magnetite is a natural magnet! Part of a mineral group called the oxides,magnetite can usually be identified by its strong magnetism and dark color.Magnetite is often not very abundant,but it can be found in many different types of igneous,metamorphic,and sedimentary rocks.It can even be found in some meteorites.Magnetite Rock (Ore) Booga Booga : Roblox Wiki FANDOMMagnetite Rock is the rock appeared in Soybeen stream.It looks like a recolored Emerald Rock.(color is of course purple due to its ores being Magnetite) In the Void Dimension,it is in a cave in a Island in the corner (opposite of the Triplet Islands and not the big island with Void Ants).

## Magnetic Attraction meteorites.wustl.edu
Most terrestrial (Earth) rocks also do not attract magnets for the same reason.Some earth rocks do attract magnets,however,because they contain the mineral magnetite.A good way to test if a rock is attracted to a magnet is with a circular ceramic magnet like those often used for &quotrefrigerator magnets.&quotMagnetite Vs.Meteorite SciencingApr 24,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32Magnetite is made up of iron oxide,making it opaque and metallic,much like a meteorite could appear some other meteorites,however,can be brown or gray.Most meteorites contain an iron and nickel alloy,while terrestrial rocks like magnetite most often do not contain nickel.

## Hematite: A primary ore of iron and a pigment mineral
Hematite is the world's most important ore of iron.Although magnetite contains a higher percentage of iron and is easier to process,hematite is the leading ore because it is more abundant and present in deposits in many parts of the world.Hematite is mined in some of the largest mines in the world.Magnetite mineral BritannicaMagnetite: Magnetite,iron oxide mineral (FeFe2O4,or Fe3O4) that is the chief member of one of the series of the spinel (q.v.) group.Minerals in this series form black to brownish,metallic,moderately hard octahedrons and masses in igneous and metamorphic rocks and in granite pegmatites,stony meteorites,

Take the sample which you think is a meteorite and scratch it quite vigorously on the unglazed side of the tile.If it leaves a black gray streak (like a soft leaded pencil) the sample is likely magnetite,and if it leaves a vivid red to brown streak it is likely hematite.Is magnetite a type of rock answersMagnetite,a mineral found in basalt,the rock that makes up the sea floor,has particles in it which align themselves with the polar alignment of the earth (North and South).

## Magnetite Wikipedia
Magnetite is a rock mineral and one of the main iron ores,with the chemical formula Fe 3 O 4.It is one of the oxides of iron,and is ferrimagnetic it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself.It is the most magnetic of all the naturallyoccurring minerals on Earth.What Are the Uses of Magnetite? ReferenceFerric chloride and ferric sulphate are manufactured with magnetite as one of the starting materials.These chemicals are effective in clarifying raw water in water purifiion plants.The dark,glossy nature of magnetite ore has led to its use in landscaping as accent rocks.

## Difference Between Magnetite and Hematite l Magnetite vs
Jan 28,2012&nbsp&#0183&#32Magnetite and hematite are important oxides of iron.Though there are several differences between them,the key difference between magnetite and hematite is that the iron in magnetite is in +2 and +3 oxidation states whereas,in hematite,it is only in +3 oxidation state.Magnetite is black in colour,but hematite hasHow to Tell if the Rock You Found Might Be a Meteorite: 11Mar 29,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Hematite rocks leave a red streak,while magnetite rocks leave a dark gray streak,indiing that they are not meteorites.Keep in mind that many terrestrial rocks also do not leave streaks thus,while the streak test can rule out hematite and magnetite,it will not definitively prove your rock is a meteorite on its own.

## University of Minnesota's Mineral Pages: Hematite
Pure samples of the two can be distinguished because magnetite is magnetic,while hematite is not.Some hematite samples,however,do contain enough magnetite that they are weakly magnetic,so it is always a good idea to check a magnetic sample's streak by scratching the sample across a
