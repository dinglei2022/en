product shipments in 2016,~952kt were ilmenite and ~7kt were rutile,key feedstocks in the production of titanium dioxide white pigment,while ~65kt were zircon,a form of zirconium silie primarily used in ceramics and refractories.In 2017E,we estimate 73% of KMR's sales will come from ilmenitefrom the nonconductive material,while rutile and leucoxene are produced from the conductive material.In Australia,the MSP is called a dry mill.Ilmenite is transferred from the MSP to an upgrading site to produce a higher titaniumcontent ore.In South Africa,lower TiO 2graded ilmenite is smelted through an electric arc furnace to produce

## (PDF) Mineral Sands: An Overview of the Industry AMAN
Ilmenite is the most magnetic of the minerals in the MSP feed (occasionally magnetite is present,however generally not in economic quantities).This allows most of the ilmenite to be recovered as final product with no further processing.Not all of the ilmenite can be separated from the nonvaluable semimagnetic minerals at this stage.Radionuclides and radiation doses in heavy mineral sandsAbstract.Sites at the littoral of Mozambique with heavy mineral sands exploited for ilmenite,rutile and zircon and inland mineral deposits exploited for tantalite,uranium and bauxite were surveyed for ambient radiation doses,and samples were collected for the determination of radionuclide concentrations.
