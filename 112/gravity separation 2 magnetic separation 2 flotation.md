## barite silie separation through floatation process
The traditional beneficiation processes used including the combined gravitymagneticflotation process,dry magnetic separation,and heated flotation have been applied in the plant,resulting in terrible working conditions,elevated production costs,and a lowered beneficiation index,with a 50% average REO content in concentrate and 20% recovery.EFFECTIVE PROCESSING OF LOWGRADE IRON ORE2012515&ensp&#0183&enspin specific gravity and magnetic susceptibility between the desired iron minerals and the gangue minerals,it was suggested that gravity separation and or magnetic separation may be useful to concentrate this type of ore.These two techniques were adopted for the beneficiation of the Wadi Halfa lowgrade iron ore.
