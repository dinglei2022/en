## How are metals with different reactivities extracted,
It is more expensive and wasteful to extract a metal from a low grade ore,but most high grade ores have already been used Extraction methods The extraction method used depends on the metal,Extracting minerals and metals from the seaMagnesium is also important for the production of titanium and other metals The use of magnesium by the automotive industry is increasing,The metal is extracted from seawater and brines by.

## Reactivity series Wikipedia
In chemistry,a reactivity series (or activity series) is an empirical,calculated,and structurally analytical progression of a series of metals,arranged by their &quotreactivity&quot from highest to lowest.It is used to summarize information about the reactions of metals with acids and water,double displacement reactions and the extraction of metals from their ores.Abeka Chemistry Test 7 Study Guide Flashcards QuizletStart studying Abeka Chemistry Test 7 Study Guide Learn vocabulary,terms,and more with flashcards,games,and other study tools,A lightweight metal extracted from bauxite and widely used in aircraft,space craft,and beverage cans is?,magnesium,and iron (II) ions is called what water?

## Occurrence of Metals: Metal Ores,Methods of Extraction,
Metals are usually extracted from the earth by mining Or All ores are minerals,but not all minerals are or Ores are those minerals which contain metals The picture shown above is a gold bearing ore Different methods are used to extract different metals For instance,common metals like iron are smelted using carbon as a reducing agentMetals GCSE Chemistry Revision xtremepapers.xyz,TheOres are naturally occurring minerals from which a metal can be extracted.Most ores are metals oxide,carbonate or sulfide mixed with other impurities.The extraction of metal from ores begun long ago when people started purifying iron from its iron oxide ore by reducing it using charcoal.
