## fine mesh powder screen Solutions In Motion
Typically powder coatings are sieved in the 80120 mesh range by the manufacturer.This mesh range is dependent on the type of powder and appliion where the powder is applied.When a customer approaches me with an appliion involving powder coating reclaim,I first inquire about his appliion.Effect of Particle Size on Solder Paste (Part I) DrBear in mind that (per the ANSI IPC powder JSTD006A,the type '4' is typically between 25 and 38 microns,while the type '3' is from 25 to 45microns in diameter,so the type '4' is just a smaller range of particle diameters.
