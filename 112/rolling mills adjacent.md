Dynamic characteristic analysis of a twostand reversible cold rolling mill in the startup process was carried out.The delay algorithm of the interstand thickness was proposed.A new method combined with the accelerated secant and the tangent methods was established to solve the simultaneous equations.The thickness and interstand tension transition processes with different static tensionUS5660070ATension bridles for a cold rolling reducing mill are provided.The reducing mill reduces the thickness of a metal strip passing through the reducing mill.The tension bridles create tension on the metal strip between the bridle and the first reducing stand to receive the metal strip and between the final reducing stand and the exit bridle so that a greater reduction can be made in the.

## Failure analysis of work rolls of a thin hot strip mill.
In hot rolling mills,premature failure of rolls is a major concern as it adversely affects the mill operation as well as production.Analysis of failed roll materials and actual rolling conditions in service are therefore necessary to understand the roll failure mechanism and thereby improve the wear resistance and extend the service life of rolls.EVRAZ Portland EVRAZ North AmericaEVRAZ has the only plate mill in the Western U.S.and adjacent Canadian provinces.We also operate quench and tempering lines.Our proximity to deep water ports and rail allows us to cost effectively source domestic or foreign steel slabs.
