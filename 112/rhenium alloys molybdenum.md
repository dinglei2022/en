## Molybdenum Melting Points of Binary Eutectic Alloys
The melting point of an alloy of two (binary) or more metals depends on the relative proportions of the ingredients.an eutectic mixture is the mixture where the melting point is as low as possible Binary eutectic Molybdenum Mo alloys,with composition and melting points are indied below:Refractory metals WikipediaRefractory metals are a class of metals that are extraordinarily resistant to heat and wear.The expression is mostly used in the context of materials science,metallurgy and engineering.The definition of which elements belong to this group differs.The most common definition includes five elements: two of the fifth period (niobium and molybdenum) and three of the sixth period (tantalum
