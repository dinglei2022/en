## Blast Furnace Slag Material Description RMRC
Blast Furnace Slag Material Description ORIGIN In the production of iron,iron ore,iron scrap,and fluxes (limestone and or dolomite) are charged into a blast furnace along with coke for fuel.The coke is combusted to produce carbon monoxide,which reduces the iron ore to a molten iron product.Blast Furnace Slag National Slag AssociationBlast Furnace Slag is formed when iron ore or iron pellets,coke and a flux (either limestone or dolomite) are melted together in a blast furnace.When the metallurgical smelting process is complete,the lime in the flux has been chemically combined with the aluminates and silies of the ore and coke ash to form a nonmetallic product called blast furnace slag.
