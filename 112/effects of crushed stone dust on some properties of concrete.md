## Aggregates for Concrete Civil Engineering
Aggregates for Concrete bination of gravels or crushed stone with particles predominantly larger than 5 mm (02 in) and generally between 95 mm and 375 mm (3⁄ 8 in and 11⁄ 2 in) Some natural aggregate deposits,called pit run gravel,consist of gravel and sand that can be readily used in concrete after minimal processing Natural.Effect of Fineness of Sand on the Cost and Properties of.It is well known that aggregate plays an important role in achieving the desired properties of concrete.Though,aggregate constitute 80 to 90% of the total volume of concrete,yet very littleattention is given in controlling the grading and surface texture of aggregate to optimize the properties of concrete.Crushed Stone (Average 1155Kg.
