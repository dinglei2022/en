## Gold Recovery: 8 Steps (with Pictures) instructables
The melting point of gold is 1063 ˚C,which is a higher temperature than can be obtained by cheap torches and burners.By adding borax to the heavy mineral concentrate,the melting point temperature decreases,allowing people to melt gold out of their concentrate and salvage.By using borax,no mercury flour is produced,and gold recoveryIntroduction to Mineral Processing cpchemGold,silver,copper,lead,zinc,molybdenum,iron,potash,phosphate,and even sand for glass are often processed by froth flotation.Without froth flotation,many of the metals and minerals used every day in our modern world would be much more expensive.Solvent Extraction Solvent extraction is a hydrometallurgical process.The process entails:

## Gold extraction Wikipedia
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing,resulting in direct recovery ofNewmont's Nevada International MiningTwin Creeks has optimised its Sage mill blend to increase gold recovery by limiting chemical variation within its various stockpiles.The team evaluated the existing recovery process to determine opportunities for improvement.Improved chemical control has led to a highergrade blend through the mill an average of 7,200 oz of gold per year.
