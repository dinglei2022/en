## Gold extraction Wikipedia
Hard rock ores have formed the basis of the majority of commercial gold recovery operations since the middle of the 20th century where open pit and or subsurface mining techniques are used.Once the ore is mined it can be treated as a whole ore using a dump leaching or heap leaching processes.This is typical of lowgrade,oxide deposits.Heap Leaching: A Growing Technology in BeneficiationCompared to conventional milling,heap leaching facilities generally have far fewer serious acid rock drainage (ARD) problems.Heap leaching is less sensitive to changes in commodity pricing,making it a lower risk investment.Furthermore,since more ore (ore with a lower grade cutoff) can be processed,the mine life is often longer,the.
