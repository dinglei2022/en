## Concrete help??? Screwfix Community Forum
Jan 07,2007&nbsp&#0183&#32Each bag is roughly 800kg so 6 cement per bulk bag will do.If you hire a mixer it will probably be a orange belle mixer.In these I put 12 good shovels of ballast to 1 2bag of cement.The best way to add the cement is to use an old saw and cut the bags in half and add the 1 2bag after 6 ballast.How many bags of cement are in a yard? AnswersDriveHow many pounds of cement does it take to make a yard of concrete? An average 1:2:3 mix contains one part cement,two parts sand and three parts gravel.To make 1 cubic yard of concrete,you'd need seven 94 pound bags of cement,about 1 2 cubic yard of sand and just over 3 4 cubic yard of gravel.
