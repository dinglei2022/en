## What's the Difference Between Cement and Concrete?
Portland cement's chemistry comes to life in the presence of water.Cement and water form a paste that surrounds and binds each particle of sand and stone.Through a chemical reaction of cement and water called hydration,the paste hardens and gains strength.The character of concrete is determined by the quality of the paste.Effect of calcium chloride on the hydration and, DeepDyveRead "Effect of calcium chloride on the hydration and leaching of lead retarded cement,Cement and Concrete Research" on DeepDyve,the largest online rental service for scholarly research with thousands of academic publications available at your fingertips

## The Pozzolanic Reaction in Concrete: Defined US Grout
The science behind that amazing pozzolanic reaction is this: the particle binding glue of concrete—Calcium Silica Hydrate (CSH)—is the result of combining water and Portland cement But that same hydration reaction also produces Calcium Hydroxide (CH) by products (up to 25% of the hydrated Portland cement) that not only do nothing to.Cement hydrationCement hydration By the process of hydration (reaction with water) Portland cement mixed with sand,gravel and water produces the synthetic rock we call concrete

## CBD165.Calcium Chloride in Concrete NRCIRC
In addition to increasing the rate of cement hydration,calcium chloride also causes the hydration reaction to start sooner.Hydration of cement produces heat,and because hydration is more rapid in the presence of calcium chloride heat is produced at a faster rate,particularly in the first 10 to 12 hours.
