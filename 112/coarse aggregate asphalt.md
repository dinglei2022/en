## HOW TO EVALUATE QUALITY OF AGGREGATES FOR ASPHALT
Selecting an aggregate material for use in an asphalt concrete depends upon the availability,cost,and quality of the material,as well as the type of construction that is intended.The suitability of aggregates for use in asphalt concrete is determined by evaluating the material in terms of: (1) Size and gradingAggregate Washington Asphalt Pavement AssociationIn HMA,aggregates are combined with a asphalt binding medium to form a compound material.By weight,aggregate generally accounts for between 92 and 96 percent of HMA and makes up about 25 percent of the cost of an HMA pavement structure.Aggregate is also used by itself or with a stabilizer for base and subbase courses.Coarse aggregate

## Hot Mix Asphalt Asphalt Calculator Calculate Aggregate
Hot mix asphalt (HMA) pavement refers to the bound layers of a flexible pavement structure.Asphalt pavement material is a precisely engineered product composed of about 95 percent stone,sand,and gravel by weight,and about 5 percent asphalt cement,a petroleum product.Asphalt cement acts as the glue to hold the pavement together.
