## Conversion Factors and the Specific Gravity of Minerals
Unity factors and conversion factors are conceptually different,and we'll see that the &quotdimensional analysis&quot we develop for unit conversion problems must be used with care in the case of functions.Specific Gravity (SG) is determined by attaching the sample to aSpecific Gravity Of Oil Calculator Convert API toSpecific Gravity Of Oil Calculator.Specific gravity (sp gr) measures the ratio of density of the substance to the density of water in a given temperature,(i.e.4 o C).It is a dimensionless unit.Oil gravity differs for each liquid.Use the online API to Specific gravity converter to find the Sp gr of an oil by providing the API gravity.
