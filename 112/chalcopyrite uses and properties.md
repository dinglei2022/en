## Chalcopyrite an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Chalcopyrite is essentially unleached under the mild oxidizing conditions of heap leaching (very slow leach kinetics).It can,however,be leached under oxidizing conditions at elevated temperatures or by microbial leaching under lowpotential conditions (Gericke,Govender,&amp Pinches,2010).This has led to extensive study into leaching of chalcopyrite concentrates as an alternative to smelting.Characterising chalcopyrite liberation and flotatio.A series of summary properties were calculated based on this extracted data.was used to calculated free surface liberation with respect to chalcopyrite.
