## Motor Repair Best Practices Part 1 Motor Rotor Balancing
The degree to which a motor is out of balance is referred to as imbalance.Rotor imbalance creates force on the bearing assembly,resulting in vibration and heat.Old style pagers,for example,used small motors that were very imbalanced to create a vibration in your pocket.Like a vibrating pager,extreme imbalances are east to identify.Vibration in Electric Motors xyobalancerWhen analyzing vibration data for motors,it is typical to observe a vibration component at twice the line frequency (at 100 120Hz).The line frequency (50 60Hz) is the frequency at which AC power is supplied to the motor this causes changes in magnetic attraction between the rotor and stator at twice the line frequency.
