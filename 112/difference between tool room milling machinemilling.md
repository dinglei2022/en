## What is the difference between a lathe and a milling machine?
A milling machine holds a piece of material still and uses rotary tools to shape it,while a lathe rotates a piece of material and uses non rotary tools to shape it.These processes are called “milling” and “turning”,and both of them are considered “machining”.Lathes are best suited.LATHES TYPES OF LATHES irem senSlight differences in the various engine lathes make it easy such as turning,boring,drilling,reaming,producing screw to group them into three categories: lightweight bench engine threads,taper turning,knurling,and radius forming,and can lathes,precision tool room lathes,and gap lathes,which are be adapted for special milling.
