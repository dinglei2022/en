## Characterization of humic acids extracted from a lignite
resolution MS.Statistical analysis of the mass spectra revealed the composition of humic acids at the molecular level.2 Experimental 2.1 Samples and reagents Shengli lignite was obtained from Xilinhaote loed in Inner Mongolia,China,and pulverized to pass through a 150mesh sieve followed by drying at 85 C for 8 h in vacuum.Table 1Chapter 1: The Geography of Mississippiof lignite coal are all types of mineral resources in Mississippi.PTS: 5 DIF: Hard 30.ANS: 1.Mississippi 2.Arkansas 3.Louisiana 4.Tennessee 5.Missouri PTS: 5 DIF: Easy 31.ANS: The Delta Basin Region is on the border of the Mississippi River and is the most fertile soil in our state.It is a region which grows a great deal of row crops.
