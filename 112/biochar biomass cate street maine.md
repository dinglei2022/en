## Review of the stability of biochar in soils
Apr 10,2014&nbsp&#0183&#32Biochar is not a structured homogeneous material rather it possesses a range of chemical structures and a heterogeneous elemental composition.This variability is based on the conditions of pyrolysis and the biomass parent material,with biochar spanning the range of various forms of black carbon.Thereby,this variability induces a broad spectrum in the observed rates ofEffects of Amendment of Biochar Produced from WoodyThe yield of TI was increased over the control under biochar treatment.Effects of biomass yield were different for two kinds of beans due to the different dependence on fertilizers of the crop,which was partially proved by significant increase of soil fertility of TI and inconsistent nutrients change of BL.842 West Taylor Street,Chicago

## Biochar can I just buy charcoal and grind it up
From what I understand,biochar is the same substance as charcoal,just put to a different use.Can I just buy a bag of charcoal at the market,grind it up and spread it on my field? Most of the websites seem to be focused on how to make it,but charcoal is cheap and easily available where I am,so why not just buy it?Cate Street changes 'whole nature' of Millinocket pelletMar 06,2014&nbsp&#0183&#32Cate Street changes 'whole nature' of Millinocket pellet plant proposal.with technology from Zilkha Biomass Energy Cate Street is assembling private financing to complement
