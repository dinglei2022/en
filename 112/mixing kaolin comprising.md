## Innovative titanium dioxide‐kaolin mixed pigments
Purpose Kaolin is a soft,white mineral mainly composed of coarse‐ to fine‐grained,plate‐like aluminum silie particles.As kaolin assists with desired rheological properties that help maintain proper dispersion and provide bulk to the product,it is used as an important extender in paint manufacture.It can be used to reduce the amount of expensive pigments,such as titanium dioxide.How brick is made material,production processNatural clay minerals,including kaolin and shale,make up the main body of brick.Small amounts of manganese,barium,and other additives are blended with the clay to produce different shades,and barium carbonate is used to improve brick's chemical resistance to the elements.

## How porcelain is made material,making,used,processing
The term porcelain refers to a wide range of ceramic products that have been baked at high temperatures to achieve vitreous,or glassy,qualities such as translucence and low porosity.Among the most familiar porcelain goods are table and decorative china,chemical ware,dental crowns,and electrical insulators.Soil Improvement by Mixing: Techniques and Performances40 and 50% kaolin clay,the rest of the volume being occupied by the Fontainebleau sand (Table 1).The mixing process consisted in dry mixing the powder compounds (kaolin clay,cement,sand) in the first stage,then adding the dry mixture into the corresponding water quantity,followed by mixing all the ingredients in a mortar mixer for 10 minutes.
