## Developments in HPGR technology Mining Magazine
The operating cost savings of HPGRs are frequently made up not only by a reduction in the power consumption,but by a reduction in wear costs This is an often overlooked fact and stresses the importance of the wear protection system and its optimisationEvaluation of dry grinding using HPGR in closed circuit,Circuits closed with air classification have enabled the use of HPGR in the cement industry for reliable pre mill grind or final product grind,reducing power and steel usage cost,and increasing capacity,while operating to make high quality product as fine as 25 μm (Van,
