## The Life Cycle of Water Used in Flotation: a Review.
Since human daily demands for fresh water have been increased significantly,the supply of fresh water for the mining industry,especially froth flotation,should be considerably reduced.In addition,stricter environmental standards have been implemented in many countries to reduce the risks due to the disposal of wastewater,many flotation operators have to seek more efficient ways to.Minerals Special Issue : Flotation ReagentsThe use of mixtures of thiol collectors is reportedly beneficial in sulfide flotation.This is becoming standard practice for many concentrators,but process water recirculation and re use in flotation circuits may compromise the behaviour of such mixtures owing to changes in physicochemical interactions occurring in the pulp phase as a result of water quality variations.
