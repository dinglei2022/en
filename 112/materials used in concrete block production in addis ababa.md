Concrete is one of the versatile and widely used building material in the world construction industry.Fine and coarse aggregates make about 70% by volume of concrete production.It goes without saying that the quality of concrete is thus strongly influenced by aggregate's physical and mechanical properties as well as chemical composition of the parent aggregate making material.Tesfaalem Kahsay.pdf Addis Ababa University InstitutionalWe can classify building materials used for different components of building as factory and non factory products,depending on their production such as,concrete and hollow concrete blocks are nonfactory products which are mostly produced on site from three basic ingredients namely,cement,aggregate and water&nbsp
