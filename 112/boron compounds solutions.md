Boron compounds are also used in organic synthesis,a particular type of glass manufacture and as a wood preservative.Borax was earlier used to make perborate,which is the bleaching agent widely used in some detergents.Other Uses for Boron Etimine USACorrosion Inhibitors The alkalinity and strong buffering action of boron compounds makes it useful as part of solutions for preventing corrosion of ferrous metals.The principal use of borates in this field is probably in antifreeze formulations.The value of borax in this appliion is enhanced by its high solubility in ethylene&nbsp
