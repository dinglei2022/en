## Validation of an Association Rule MiningBased Method to
Association rule mining,then,is a technique for efficiently identifying association rules with good predictive power from a dataset.Any pairwise combination of items (or sets of items) could,theoretically,form an association rule,so we employee several statistical measures of "interestingness" to differentiate rules which are likelyMining Fuzzy Association Rules Using Mutual Informationintervals.To dominant this problem,Mining fuzzy association rules for quantitative values has been considered by a number of researches [8][13],most of which have based their methods on the important APriori algorithm.Chan and Au introduced FAPACS for mining fuzzy association rules [14].Instead of using intervals,FAPACS employs linguistic
