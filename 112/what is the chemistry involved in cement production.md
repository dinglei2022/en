## chemical industry Overview,Importance,&amp History
Chemical industry: Chemical industry,complex of processes,operations,and organizations engaged in the manufacture of chemicals and their derivatives.Raw materials include fossil fuels and inorganic chemicals.An average chemical product is passed from factory to factory several times before it emerges into the market.Chemical Processing,Unit Operation &amp Unit ProcessThe growth with restrains,green challenge to chemical industry and the modern separations process involved in the indian chemical industry seen today.We define Chemical Engineering as a synthesis of chemistry and engineering.A Chemical Engineering therefore carries out on a large scale reactions developed in the laboratory by the chemist.

## Well Construction & Groundwater Protection FracFocus,
The production casing is typically set into place with cement using the same method as the one used for surface and intermediate casing In drill holes that deviate from vertical,casing centralizers like the one shown above are placed on the outside of the casing to center it in the holeHealth hazards of cement dust.Cement industry is involved in the development of structure of this advanced and modern world but generates dust during its production.Cement dust causes lung function impairment,chronic obstructive lung disease,restrictive lung disease,pneumoconiosis and carcinoma of the lungs,stomach and colon.
