## Climate friendly kilns could reduce Bangladesh's emissions,
The new technology is based on the German ‘Hoffman kiln’ developed in the mid 19th century to bake clay In 1999,China improvised the German technology into the more environment friendly 'hybrid Hoffman kiln' (HHK),in which coal and clay are injected into a chamber and mixed to form raw,wet bricks,which are later driedFotoDevelopment: Green Bricks of Bangladesh by KhaledA new UNDP project,supported by the Global Environment Facility,uses Hybrid Hoffman Kiln (HHK) technology imported from Germany to make green bricks.A single new kiln can produce 15 million bricks annually (instead of 100,000) and carbon emissions from each kiln
