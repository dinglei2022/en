Types of iron ore.The major rock types mined for the production of metallic iron are massive hematite,pisolitic goethite limonite,which provide a 'highgrade' ore,and banded metasedimentary ironstone,magnetiterich metasomatite,to a much lesser degree,rocks rich in siderite,rocks rich in chamosite which provide a 'lowgrade' ore.Wisconsin Geological & Natural History Survey » Mining: IronTypes of iron ore Iron ore is present in a number of places and geologic settings within Wisconsin Iron ore can be defined on the basis of its iron content into low grade ore (taconite),which commonly contains 25 to 35% iron,and high grade ore,which contains 50 to 70% iron
