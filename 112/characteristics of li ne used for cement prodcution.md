## Polymer Concrete Topic
Polymer concrete is a composite material in which the aggregate is bound together in a matrix with a polymer binder.The composites do not contain a hydrated cement phase,although portland cement can be used as an aggregate or filler.Polymer concrete composites possess a unique combination of properties dependent on the formulation.Coal &amp cement World Coal AssociationClinker is mixed with gypsum and ground to a fine powder to make cement.Coal is used as an energy source in cement production.Large amounts of energy are required to produce cement.It takes about 200 kg of coal to produce one tonne of cement and about 300400 kg of cement is needed to produce one cubic metre of concrete.

## Cement Wikipedia
The use of concrete in construction grew rapidly from 1850 onward,and was soon the dominant use for cements.Thus Portland cement began its predominant role.Isaac Charles Johnson further refined the production of mesoPortland cement (middle stage of development) and claimed he was the real father of Portland cement.Composition of cement engr.psu.eduPortland cement gets its strength from chemical reactions between the cement and water.The process is known as hydration.This is a complex process that is best understood by first understanding the chemical composition of cement.Manufacture of cement Portland cement is manufactured by crushing,milling and proportioning the following materials:
