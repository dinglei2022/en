## Comparison of Two Fat Extraction Methods
For our first objective,which was to assess the efficiency of both extraction methods,we have gathered interesting and significant results.For the solvent method,the results were pretty accurate and precise.Using cardboard and olive oil,we got an average of 97.6% extracted fatExtraction in Theory and Practice (Part I)A similar observation will be made if a low boiling solvent is used for extraction.The shaking of the mixture increases the surface area,and therefore the apparent vapor pressure of the solvent.In addition,many extraction processes are exothermic because they involve an acidbase reaction.f.

## COPPER(II) EXTRACTION FROM AMMONIA LEACH SOLUTION
Solvent extraction (SX) of copper(II) from ammonia solutions proceeds similarly to that from acidic solutions,but complexation of metal (M) by ammonia ligands must be considered: 22 M 4NH M(NH )334 + +=+.(1) During extraction ammonia ligands are pushed out and a new chelate complex with hydroxyoxime is formed in organic phase.What is Solvent Extraction and Why is it Important?Solvent extraction has always proved itself very helpful as a recovery method for many components.It is a method of separating compounds on the basis of their solubility in two different immiscible liquids like water and organic compound.

From Fig.3a,the extraction of Pb(II) increased progressively with increasing pH from 1.0 to 5.0,after which there was a slight decline in the percent of Pb(II) extracted.This could be attributed to the formation of higher lead hydroxide complexes and thus could apparently explain the loss in Pb(II) extractionAcidBase Extraction Chemistry LibreTextsAn acidbase extraction is a type of liquidliquid extraction.It typically involves different solubility levels in water and an organic solvent.The organic solvent may be any carbonbased liqiuid that does not dissolve very well in water common ones are ether,ethyl acetate,or dichloromethane.
