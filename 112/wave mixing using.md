## Modeling intersubcarrier fourwave mixing noises in QAM
For coherent orthogonal frequencydivision multiplexed (COOFDM) system,fourwavemixing (FWM) noise is a major limiting factor.A scheme of phaseconjugated twin waves (PCTW) which copropagates a signal with its phaseconjugated copy along optical fiber link,can beLow noise kinetic inductance travelingwave amplifierThe device was made from NbTiN and consisted of a long,coplanar waveguide on a silicon chip.By adding a DC current and an RF pump tone we are able to generate parametric amplifiion using threewave mixing.The devices exhibit gain of more than 15 dB across an instantaneous bandwidth from 4
