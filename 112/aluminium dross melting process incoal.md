## Dross Wikipedia
Dross is a mass of solid impurities floating on a molten metal or dispersed in the metal,such as in wrought iron.It forms on the surface of lowmeltingpoint metals such as tin,lead,zinc or aluminium or alloys by oxidation of the metal.For higher melting point metals such as steel,oxidized impurities melt and float making them easy to pour off.Aluminium dross recycling WikipediaAluminium dross recycling is a completely different process to strictly aluminium recycling.Aluminium recycling is where pure aluminium metal products (previously used in another form) are remelted into aluminium ingots and then reused to new aluminium products.
