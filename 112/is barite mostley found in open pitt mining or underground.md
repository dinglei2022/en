## Reading: Open Pit Mining Geology Lumen Learning
Reading: Open Pit Mining Open pit mining,or open cast mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunneling into the earth,such as long wall miningMining Costs CAPEX vs.OPEX UndervaluedEquityIn general,underground mining is more expensive than open pit mining as with open pit mining the minerals are found near the surface at a maximum of approximately 200400 meters depth in bulk tonnage.The mining costs are estimated in a mining company's feasibility study which,when available,can be found on the company's website (often hidden between the news releases).

Most of the barite mining operations in the United States ceased Mining and Production Most of Arkansas's bedded deposits were worked solely by open pit methods,but the Chamberlain Creek deposit in Hot Spring County was mined by both open pit and underground techniqu Ore in the deeper parts of the syncline was mined underground to as much.Geology and mining history of the Southeast MissouriMar 09,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32By the 1860's barite was recovered from the residuum by hand mining,also resulting in widespread diggings,but generally not underground mines in bedrock.Mechanized openpit mining of the residuum for barite began in the 1920's.Barite production slowed by the 1980's,and there has not been any barite mining since 1998.
