## A Modified Molybdenum Blue Method for Orthophosphate
It involves the reaction of acid ammonium molybdate with P i ions to form phosphomolybdenum complexes,which are reduced to molybdenum blue by ascorbic acid.However,it is known that the assay conditions used can cause partial hydrolysis of some labile organic phosphate (P o) and condensed P i,resulting in overestimation of P i (Lowry andMolybdate phosphate spectrophotometric analysis VIPErFor the phosphate analysis,we are using the ammonium molybdate ascorbic acid spectrophotometric assay,working under very dilute concentrations for the standards (~0.05 ppm).Has anyone done this analysis before and have any key procedural tips? The issue is we are not getting particularly linear results for our standard curves.
