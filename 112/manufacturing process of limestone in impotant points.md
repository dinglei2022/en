The pelletal material exiting the kiln is called "clinker." Gypsum is added,and the clinkergypsum mixture is finely ground into Portland cement.The burning of limestone in the cementmaking process liberates carbon dioxide gas (formula CO2).Limestone is used in the manufacture of three kinds of lime that have a wide range of uses.Technology of lime production and concrete manufacture UCLThe type of limestone calcined to produce lime for the manufacture of cements and concretes can profoundly affect the durability and properties of the material produced.Lime.&quot;Calx&quot;,lime in Latin.It is at this point in the process that the aggregate is added to the cement to make mortar or concrete.Aggregates are mixed&nbsp;.
