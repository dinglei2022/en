## Metallurgy Of Aluminium Alloys PDF Download
Metallurgy wikipedia,metallurgy is a domain of materials science and engineering that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements,their inter metallic compounds,and their mixtures,which are called alloysTempering (metallurgy) WikipediaTempering is a process of heat treating,which is used to increase the toughness of ironbased alloys.Tempering is usually performed after hardening,to reduce some of the excess hardness,and is done by heating the metal to some temperature below the critical point for a certain period of time,then allowing it to cool in still air.The exact temperature determines the amount of hardness
