## Copper mining.From ore to copper.SchoolScience.co.uk
About 80% of all copper extracted comes from sulphide ores.A typical ore contains only 0.5% to 2.0% copper.It is a measure of the value of copper that it is worth extracting it from such small concentrations.The ore is a mixture of minerals and rock (called gangue).The most common copperUnit 1: 3 Metals and their Uses Flashcards QuizletPlants can absorb copper ions from lowgrade copper ores as they grow.The plants are then burnt and the metals can be extracted from the ash.The copper ions could be dissolved from the ash by adding sulphuric acid to make a solution of copper sulphate.Then we can use displacement by scrap iron and electrolysis to extract the pure copper metal.
