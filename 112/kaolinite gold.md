Kyanite is a mineral found mainly in metamorphic rocks.It most often forms from the highpressure alteration of clay minerals during the metamorphism of sedimentary rocks.It is found in the schists and gneisses of regionally metamorphosed areas and less often in quartzite or eclogite.Kyanite's typical habit is a bladed crystal,although it sometimes occurs as radiating
