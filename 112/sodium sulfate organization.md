## Sodium Sulfate Separation from Aqueous Alkaline Solutions
The thermodynamics and kinetics of crystallization of sodium sulfate with a tripodal trisurea receptor (L1) from aqueous alkaline solutions have been measured in the 15 55 &#176C temperature range for a fundamental understanding of the elementary steps involved in this sulfate separation method.Are All Sulfates Bad? The Public Goods BlogMay 06,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32EWG has assigned sodium sulfate and SLSA a hazard score of 1 out of 10,meaning the organization doesn't view the substances as public health concerns.Unlike SLS,there is no reported risk of contaminating these chemicals during their manufacturing process.
