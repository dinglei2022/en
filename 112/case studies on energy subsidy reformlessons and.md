IMF Study Provides Lessons for Energy Subsidies Reform story highlights The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has released a new report titled "Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications," that explores how conventional energy subsidies reduce incentives for investment in renewable energy and accelerate the depletion of natural resources.Energy subsidies WikipediaEnergy subsidies are measures that keep prices for consumers below market levels or for producers above market levels,or reduce costs for consumers and producers.Energy subsidies may be direct cash transfers to producers,consumers,or related bodies,as well as indirect support mechanisms,such as tax exemptions and rebates,price controls,trade restrictions,and limits on market access.

## Removal of Agricultural Subsidies in New Zealand.
Agricultural subsidies are generally the policy of countries wealthy enough to afford them.By and large,the practice is destructive to the land,distorting markets,and,in the age of a global economy,detrimental to the livelihoods of farmers in countries without subsidies.Hydropowered Mini Grids in Nepal Mini Grids Support.Since 1996,Nepal’s Alternative Energy Promotion Center (AEPC) has helped develop more than 2,000 hydropowered mini grids,providing 30 MW of electricity to 1.5 million people.AEPC supports renewable energy mini grid development through subsidies,technical assistance and training in productive uses of energy.

Since energy subsidies are relatively large,it is useful to examine the motivations and implications of providing energy subsidies in particular.This paper covers qualitative case studies from Iran,Nigeria,and India to illustrate a series of lessons for governments implementing subsidy reform policies.Utilization of passenger transport subsidy in Kolkata: AAs a case study we analyse the role of subsidy in CSTC,which was set up in 1948,as the State Transport Organization,a department under the Government of West Bengal and later turned into a corporation in 1960.The CSTC is selected as a sample for the present study because it is the oldest transport corporation.
