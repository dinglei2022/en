The second approach to ball diameter calibration is the socalled absolute method.In absolute measurement,temperature is a first order error,that must be held at 68 &#176F (20 &#176C) exactly,or any variations must be compensated for.A micrometer or threaddriven measuring machine is an example of the absolute concept.How Often Should You Calibrate a Thermometer? TundraIf a thermometer is ever dropped,you should go ahead and calibrate it.If a thermometer is going from a wide variety of temperatures (from freezing temperatures to boiling temperatures),it should also be calibrated more frequently.Every time you invest in a new thermometer,calibrate it before using it.
