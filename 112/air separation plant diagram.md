## PowerPoint Presentation
Cryogenic air separation takes advantage of the differing boiling points of its components as shown in Table 1.In order to start the separation process,a large quantity of the incoming air needs to be liquefied.This is accomplished by cooling the air by decreasing its temperature and manipulating the pressure until condensation begins.Cryogenic Air Separation asynsteelCryogenic air separation process is one of the most popular air separation process,used frequently in medium to large scale plants.It is the most preferred technology for producing nitrogen,oxygen,and argon as gases and or liquid products and supposed to be the most cost effective technology for high production rate plants.
