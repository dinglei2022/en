## Hematite: A primary ore of iron and a pigment mineral
What is Hematite? Hematite is one of the most abundant minerals on Earth's surface and in the shallow crust.It is an iron oxide with a chemical composition of Fe 2 O 3.It is a common rockforming mineral found in sedimentary,metamorphic,and igneous rocks at loions throughout the world.Hematite is the most important ore of iron.Although it was once mined at thousands of loions around(PDF) Environmental impact assessment of open pit miningPDF Mining is widely regarded as having adverse effects on environment of both magnitude and diversity.Some of these effects include erosion,formation of sinkhole,biodiversity loss and
