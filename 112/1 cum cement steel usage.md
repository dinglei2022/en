## Reinforced concrete Wikipedia
Reinforced concrete (RC) (also called reinforced cement concrete or RCC) is a composite material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility.The reinforcement is usually,though not necessarily,steel reinforcing bars and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before theHow to Use Steel Fibers in Concrete Concrete ConstructionMar 30,2012&nbsp&#0183&#32The largest appliion for steel fiber reinforced concrete is floor slab construction,although its use as a replacement for or complement to structural reinforcement in other appliions is growing fast.Steel fiber floor slab appliions can save money when compared to
