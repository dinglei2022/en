## What Is Oil Drilling? Sciencing
Oil drilling is the process by which tubing is bored through the Earth's surface and a well is established A pump is connected to the tube and the petroleum under the surface is forcibly removed from underground Oil drilling is a highly specialized business that grew into the largest industry on the planet by.Recovering Drilling Muds and Drill Cuttings for Reuse,Drilling mud aids in the process of drilling a borehole into the earth Such holes are drilled for oil and gas extraction,core sampling and a variety of other purpos The fluid is used to lubricate the drill bit and transport the drill cuttings to the surface (US Environmental Protection Agency,epagov)

## Drilling rig Wikipedia
A drilling rig is an integrated system that drills wells,such as oil or water wells,in the earth's subsurfaceDrilling rigs can be massive structures housing equipment used to drill water wells,oil wells,or natural gas extraction wells,or they can be small enough to be moved manually by one person and such are called augersDrilling rigs can sample subsurface mineral deposits,Types of Pumps Used in Oil & Gas Industry Upstream,Jan 29,2018&#0183;&#32;Pumps are necessary components inside an oil drilling rig They’re designed to accelerate the transference of fluid from one location to another This article explores different types of pumps companies use in oil and gas downstream operations,their primary function,and pros and cons of each model
