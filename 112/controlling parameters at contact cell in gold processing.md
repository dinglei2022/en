Cells of nonspore formers,cells of spore formers that have not formed spores,and cells that have sporulated are referred to as "vegetative cells." Vegetative cells generally have little resistance to heat,drying and other unfavorable conditions.However,bacterial spores in general are extremely resistant to heat,cold and chemical agents.
