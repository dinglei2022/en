## Rareearth elements USGS
The rareearth elements (REEs) are 15 elements that range in atomic number from 57 (lanthanum) to 71 (lutetium) they are commonly referred to as the "lanthanides." Yttrium (atomic number 39) is also commonly regarded as an REE because it shares chemical and physical similarities and has affinities with the lanthanides.Although REEs are not rare in terms of average crustal abundance,theAustralian Rare Earths Australian Rare Earth ElementsAbout Australian Rare Earth Elements Australia,the lucky energy country,is one of very few that has large supplies of Rare Earth Elements,both heavy and light,with several ASX listed companies having sizeable,rich,world class,deposits totalling around 1 3rd of the world's known resources.
