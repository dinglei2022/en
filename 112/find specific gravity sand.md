## How to Calculate the Specific Gravity of a Substance dummies
In physics,a substance's specific gravity is the ratio of that substance's density to the density of water at 4 degrees Celsius.Because the density of water at 4 degrees Celsius is 1,000 kg m3,that ratio is easy to find.For example,the density of gold is 19,300 kg m3,so its specific gravity is the []Mass,Weight,Density or Specific Gravity of Bulk MaterialsFor example,ammonium nitrate has a specific gravity (sg) of 0.73 while dry ammonium sulphate has a sg of 1.13 (1130 kilograms cubic metre) (see.
