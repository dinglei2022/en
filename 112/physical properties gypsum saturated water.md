## Gypsum: an old product with a new use Integrated Crop
Gypsum is calcium sulfate (CaSO4).Refined gypsum in the anhydrite form (no water) is 29.4 percent calcium (Ca) and 23.5 percent sulfur (S).Usually,gypsum has water associated in the molecular structure (CaSO4&#1832H2O) and is approximately 23.3 percent Ca and 18.5 percent S (plaster of paris).Gypsum fertilizer usually has other impurities so grades are approximately 22 percent Ca and 17The effect of repeated immersion of gypsum cast in sodiumThe immersion of a completely set dental stone cast in water decreases the compressive and tensile strengths.The effect of the process of immersing a cast 7 times in sodium hypochlorite with slurry and drying for disinfection on its physical properties has not been studied and reported.

## GYPSUM (Hydrated Calcium Sulfate) Amethyst Galleries: Gypsum
Gypsum is one of the more common minerals in sedimentary environments.It is a major rock forming mineral that produces massive beds,usually from precipitation out of highly saline waters.Since it forms easily from saline water,gypsum can have many inclusions of other minerals and even trapped bubbles of air and water.Thermal and mechanical properties of gypsum plaster mixedKhalil et al,determined the effect of some waste additives on the physical and mechanical properties of gypsum plaster composites.They were used blending plaster with 0.2 10% of unburnt rice husk,blast furnace slag,calcium carbonate or commercial poly vinyl alcohol polymer to gypsum plaster composites.
