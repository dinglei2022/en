purification The information presented here is less about theory (there are several links for this on your laboratory webpage) and more about the practical aspects of purification This is vital information you will not find in most textbooks As mentioned in the introduction,there are six basic steps in purification: resolution Step 1.Simple Methods of Gold PurifiionThe purifiion of such alluvial gold alloys is a simple matter.The high specific gravity of the metal allows of separation from most admixed materials by some process of elutriation,or water concentration,or,in arid regions,by dry blowing.
