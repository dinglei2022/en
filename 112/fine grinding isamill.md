## Designing Flotation Circuits for High Fines Recovery AusIMM
The economics of fine grinding has changed fundamentally with new stirred milling processes like the IsaMill.This has also transformed flotation design due to the clean surfaces produced in the inert grinding environment and the narrow size distribution produced by the IsaMill.IsaMills Roll into New Ore Grinding Appliions E &amp MJInitially designed for ultrafine grinding,IsaMills have taken on a number of new fine and coarse grinding tasks in a wide variety of ore types.According to Xstrata Technology,its IsaMill horizontal grinding mill has gained ground in the tertiary grind and the regrind markets.
