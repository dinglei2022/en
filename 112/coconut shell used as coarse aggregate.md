## Study of Strength of Concrete by Using Coconut Shell
The use of coconut shell as coarse aggregate in concrete has never been a usual practice among the average citizens,particularly in areas where light weight concrete is required for non load bearing walls,non structural floors,and strip footings Although 37A Study on the Utilization of Coconut Shell as Coarse,07 07 2015&#0183;&#32;An optimum percentage replacement of coarse aggregate with coconut shell aggregate is determined from the study Coarse aggregate made from coconut shells were used in proportions of 5%,10%,15%,20%,25%,30% and 35% to replace coarse aggregate in conventional concrete A constant water to cement ratio of 05 was used throughout the study
