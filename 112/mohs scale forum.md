Hardness technically is the 'Resistance to permanent deformation'.The Mohs scale is relative,while Vickers,Rockwell,Brinell and Knoop are absolute measures of hardness.Mohs is a measure of scratch hardness,while the rest measure indentation.There is however a direct correlation between the two,because scratching involves two actions: 1.Moh's Hardness Scale YouTubeMar 03,2014&nbsp&#0183&#32Dylan Vizcarra and Buddy J rap Mohs hardness scale.Dylan Vizcarra and Buddy J rap Mohs hardness scale.Skip navigation Young Entrepreneurs Forum
