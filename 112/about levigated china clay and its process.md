## How porcelain is made material,making,used,processing
In effect,porcelain combines glass's low porosity with clay's ability to retain its shape when heated,making it both easy to form and ideal for domestic use.The principal clays used to make porcelain are china clay and ball clay,which consist mostly of kaolinate,a hydrous aluminum silie.How to Select The Right Clay Body For a Studio or Classroom?Porcelain,characterized by an absorption rate of 0 to 1 percent,is the product of many hundreds of years of development by early Chinese potters.Its main ingredient is Kaolin,also known as china clay.By itself,Kaolin has a melting point of around 3275 degrees
