## Galvanic interaction of grinding media with arsenopyrite
Jan 15,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32In the presence of pyrite,due to the lower galvanic current between pyrite and grinding media in comparison with arsenopyrite,the amount of iron hydroxide was lower and thus more free cyanide was available for gold extraction.It means that more gold was extracted in the presence of pyrite than the arsenopyrite.Effect of Pyrite and Pyrrhotite on the Corrosive Wear of2019115&ensp&#0183&enspMild steel (AISI 1020,0.25 C,hardness 127 Hv) was chosen to represent the grinding media material.Electrodes of pyrite,pyrrhotite and mild steel were made by mounting planar pieces of the mineral and steel samples by pressmoulding in Lucite briquettes.

## Research Article Galvanic Interaction between Chalcopyrite
Research Article Galvanic Interaction between Chalcopyrite and Pyrite with is study was aimed to investigate the galvanic interaction between pyrite and chalcopyrite with two types of grinding media (chalcopyrite and pyrite) and media.e Sarcheshmeh copper ore is a major porphyry copConsumption of steel grinding media in mills A20151123&ensp&#0183&enspSuch models could be used as expert systems to guide the selection of grinding media for different grinding systems,or at least in principle,to guide the addition of grinding media to the mill.8.Conclusions The consumption of grinding media plays an important role in the economics of grinding and as a consequence also in the overall processing of a large variety of ores.
