## Zinc Minerals Eduion Coalition
Zinc is mined from several different minerals,including sphalerite (zinc sulfide),smithsonite (zinc carbonate),hemimorphite (zinc silie) and zincite (zinc oxide).Other zincbearing minerals include willemite and hydrozincite.Zinc ore is mined in Canada,Australia,the USA,China,Peru.Lead Essential Chemical IndustryLead and zinc ores (usually sphalerite,ZnS) often occur together and may also contain silver,copper and gold.The ore has first to be separated from clays and other silies ('gangue') after which the lead ore and the zinc ore are separated.

Lead and Zinc Ores Minerals of lead and zinc commonly are rather closely associated in nature zincfree lead ores and leadfree zinc ores are exceptional rather than common,although there are such.Lead and zinc ores usually contain some silver,but those of the Mississippi Valley region are silverfree.Indeed,leadzinc ores often are commercially valuable chiefly because of their silverHow zinc is made material,used,parts,componentsZinc is usually a gray metallic color,but it can be polished to a shiny silver luster.In nature,it is only found as a chemical compound,not as pure zinc,and can be used as a raw material for castings and coatings.During the era of the Roman Empire,people used zinc to alloy copper into brass for weapons.Zinc ore is sometimes mined in

## Copper &amp Kids Where Does Copper Come From?
Copper is found in many parts of the world.It usually comes from copper ore,but small amounts are occasionally found (&quotnative copper&quot) in distorted cubic crystal chunks.Keweenaw Peninsula near Lake Superior in Michigan is one of the most likely places to find native copper!!Mining Of Zinc Zinc ccgzinc1.weeblyZinc ore is usually is found in association with those of lead,copper,gold,silver as well as other metals.Zinc is found in igneous and metamorphic rocks which usually are underground,so zinc mining is often underground but some new mines are of the open pit type.

## Sphalerite: The primary ore of zinc and a collector's gem.
What is Sphalerite? Sphalerite is a zinc sulfide mineral with a chemical composition of (Zn,Fe)S.It is found in metamorphic,igneous,and sedimentary rocks in many parts of the world.Sphalerite is the most commonly encountered zinc mineral and the world's most important ore of zinc.Dozens of countries have mines that produce sphalerite.Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper OresA.Processing of Oxide Ore.Oxide ores are generally processed using hydrometallurgy.This process uses aqueous (waterbased) solutions to extract and purify copper from copper oxide ores at ordinary temperatures,usually in three steps: heap leaching,solvent extraction,and electrowinning.
