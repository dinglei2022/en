Apr 13,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32What is a 'design concept'? Literally,it means 'an abstract idea'.But for a designer,it is a broad umbrella of steps of how to 'ideate a design'.It involves research,analysis and thorough understanding of end user.So how should one start with it?

## Design for manufacturability Wikipedia
Design for manufacturability (also sometimes known as design for manufacturing or DFM) is the general engineering practice of designing products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture The concept exists in almost all engineering disciplines,but the implementation differs widely depending on the manufacturing technologyWorkholding Principles ManufacturingETorgThe 3 2 1 location principle is used to ensure that every part placed in the device occupies the same position with respect to the cutting tools The principle is based on first establishing a plane,locating the part on three fixed points
