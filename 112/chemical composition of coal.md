## OKD Coal composition
Coal composition.Coal is a mineral in which the chemical element of carbon is prevalent.Carbon content (the socalled coalifiion) depends foremost on the time during which the conversion from plant matter to the final mineral took place.The older the coal,the higher the carbon percentage and the less apparent the original vegetable component,i.e.the fossil,remains of plant tissuesCoal: Anthracite,Bituminous,Coke,Pictures,Formation,UsesThe &quotrank&quot of a coal is a measure of how much change has occurred.Sometimes the term &quotorganic metamorphism&quot is used for this change.Based upon composition and properties,coals are assigned to a rank progression that corresponds to their level of organic metamorphism.The basic rank progression is summarized in the table here.
