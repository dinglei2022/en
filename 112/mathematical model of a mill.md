## Mathematical model Wikipedia
A mathematical model is a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language.The process of developing a mathematical model is termed mathematical modeling.Mathematical models are used in the natural sciences (such as physics,biology,earth science,chemistry) and engineering disciplines (such as computer science,electrical engineering),as well as in the social sciences (suchmathematical model of a ball mill riversidevetsmathematical model of a ball mill Grinding Mill China.The ball mill is key equipment in grinding industry,especially in mineral ore dressing plants.It is widely used for the cement,the silie product,new type building material,fireproof material,chemical fertilizer,black and nonferrous metal,glass,ceramics and etc.

## Economic model Wikipedia
The economic model is a simplified,often mathematical,framework designed to illustrate complex processes.Frequently,economic models posit structural parameters.A model may have various exogenous variables,and those variables may change to create various responses by economic variables.Methodological uses of models include investigationMathematical model of a ball mill SpringerLinkMilling Transfer Function Ball Mill Automatic Control System Dynamic Link These keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.This process is experimental and the keywords may be updated as the learning algorithm improves.
