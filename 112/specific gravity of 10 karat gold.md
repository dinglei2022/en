The Specific Gravity SG is a dimensionless unit defined as the ratio of density of the material to the density of water at a specified temperature.It is common to use the density of water at 4 o C (39 o F) as reference at this point the density of water is at the highest.Specific gravities SG for common solids and metals can be found in the table below:Specific Gravity of Alloyed Metals able2knowHi,I'd like to ask for some help regarding verifying the Specific Gravity of an alloyed metal,say a 22k gold chain,which gold content is supposed to be 916%
