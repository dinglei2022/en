## Rcovery of gold in pyritic ores mineengineer
One USBM paper summed up five noticeable characteristics of auriferous pyritic ores.The gold occurs as tiny flakes on the crystallographic planes of the pyrite.The gold flakes are very small in size,510 microns.The pyrite in which small amounts of gold occurs is of crystalline variety (primary pyrite).The Extraction of Copper Chemistry LibreTextsExtracting of Copper from Other Ores.Copper can be extracted from nonsulfide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulfuric acid to produce a very dilute copper(II) sulfate solution.
