## Mill Steel Charge Volume Calculation
We can calculate the steel charge volume of a ball or rod mill and express it as the % of the volume within the liners that is filled with grinding media.While the mill is stopped,the charge volume can be gotten by measuring the diameter inside the liners and the distance from the top of the charge to the top of the mill.
