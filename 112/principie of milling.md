Hammer Mill Working Principle The hammermill,fundamentally,is a simple mechanism.The "orthodox" machine comprises a boxlike frame,or housing,a centrally disposed,horizontalshaft rotating element (rotor) on which the hammers are mounted,and usually a set of circumferentially arranged grates in the lower part of the housing.Milling and processing IRRI Rice Knowledge BankMilling is a crucial step in postproduction of rice.The basic objective of a rice milling system is to remove the husk and the bran layers,and produce an edible,white rice kernel that is sufficiently milled and free of impurities.Depending on the requirements of the customer,the rice should have a minimum number of broken kernels.
