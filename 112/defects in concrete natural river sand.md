## Waste foundry sand in concrete: A review ScienceDirect
Concrete is the most extensively used construction material in the world,second to water.Increasing rate of urbanization and industrialization has lead to over exploitation of natural resources such as river sand and gravels,which is giving rise to sustainability issues.Use of Quarry Dust to Replace Sand in Concrete Annatural river sand has become scarce and very costly.Hence we are forced to think of alternative materials.The Quarry dust may be used in the place of river sand fully or partly.A comparatively good strength is expected when sand is replaced partially or fully with or without concrete admixtures.
