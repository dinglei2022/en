## Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and Creactive protein
Creactive protein is a better indior of inflammation than the erythrocyte sedimentation rate.It is more sensitive and responds more quickly to changes in the clinical situation.False negative and false positive results are more common when measuring the erythrocyte sedimentation rate.Sedimentation Rate (Sed Rate) Kaiser PermanenteThe sedimentation rate (sed rate) blood test measures how quickly red blood cells (erythrocytes) settle in a test tube in one hour.The more red cells that fall to the bottom of the test tube in one hour,the higher the sed rate.When inflammation is present in the body,certain proteins cause red blood cells to stick
