## How much cement,sand and agregate do I need to make one
Mar 10,2008&nbsp&#0183&#32How much cement,sand and agregate do I need to make one cubic metre of concrete? I suppose another way of asking this is how much does a cubic metre of concrete weigh? Because of access problems I'm going to have to mix the concrete on site.Knowing the area to be covered and the thickness of concrete I want to lay I can calculate the volume.how many bags per cubic meter? Screwfix Community ForumAug 19,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32to mix 1 cubic meter of cement at a ratio of 3:1 how many 20kg of sand and 25kg bags of cement will be needed? We have now cut down to 1 2 a cubic metre apparently.The consensus for 1 2 a cube seems to be,1 tonne sand,14 bags cement.This should give 3:1 BY VOLUME! ( Use a bucket for easy and accurate measuring.Do not mix it by weight).
