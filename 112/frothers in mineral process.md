## Fundamental properties of flotation frothers and their
Froth flotation process requires the use of frothers.These important flotation agents are commonly characterized as either "selective" or "powerful" and are chosen following general guidelines and verifiion by laboratory and or pilot plant tests.US9440242B2 Frothers for mineral flotation Google PatentsThe invention provides methods and compositions for improving a froth flotation type separation.The method uses a microemulsion to improve the effectiveness of a frother.The improvement allows for low dosages of frother to work as well as much greater amounts of nonmicroemulsified frother.

## The Introduction of Flotation Frothers cnfreereagent
Flotation frothers,also known as flotation foaming agent,is an essential flotation agent for froth flotation.The role of flotation frothers is mainly to produce a large amount of foam in the pulp,so that the available minerals are effectively enriched at the interface between air and water to create the conditions required for flotation process.The quality of flotation frothers directlyUS20160325290A1 Frothers for mineral flotation GoogleFrothing agents or frothers are chemicals added to the process which have the ability to change the surface tension of a liquid such that the properties of the sparging bubbles are modified.Frothers may act to stabilize air bubbles so that they will remain welldispersed in slurry,and will form a stable froth layer that can be removed before
