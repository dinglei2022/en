## Coal Production Indonesia Expected to Fall in 2016 & 2017.
There will not be a rebound in the coal industry anytime soon.Indonesia,one of the world's leading (thermal) coal producers and exporters,says the nation's coal output will continue to decline in 2016 and 2017.This continued decline in production is caused by the decision of smaller miners to cease production amid the globe's low coal prices that touched a decade low earlier this year.
