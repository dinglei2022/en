Copper accumulates mainly at the surface of soils,where it binds tightly and persists.Copper sulfate is highly soluble in water and it can bind to sediments.Copper is regulated by plants because it is an essential mineral.Too much copper can be toxic to plants as it inhibits photosynthesis.concentration copper plants alibabaAlibaba offers 518 concentration copper plants products.About 70% of these are mineral separator,10% are other mining machines.A wide variety of concentration copper plants options are available to you,such as flotation separator,gravity separator,and magnetic separator.

Understanding Plant Nutrients Soil and Applied Copper A2527 E.E.Schulte and K.A.Kelling Copper (Cu) was proven to be an essential element in 1931.The copper content of soils ranges from 2 to 100 parts per million (ppm),with anAgricultural &amp Environmental Services Laboratories UGA AESLCopper (Cu) The normal range of Cu in many plants is fairly narrow,ranging from 5 to 20 ppm.When the Cu concentration in plants is less than 3 ppm in the dry matter,deficiencies are likely to occur.When Cu levels exceed 20 ppm in mature leaves,toxicities may occur.
