## Lead(II) nitrate
2009 4 17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The chemical compound lead(II) nitrate is the inorganic salt of nitric acid and lead.It is colourless crystal or white powder and a strong,stable oxidizer.Unlike most other lead(II) salts,it is soluble in water.Its main use from the Middle Ages under the name plumb dulcis,has been as raw material in the production of many pigments.Since the 20th century,it is industrially used as heat.INFLUENCE OF LEAD NITRATE ON CYANIDE LEACHING …2013 11 22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;cyanide leaching by addition of 300 g Mg lead nitrate to the leach slurry.Furthermore,numerous studies have shown that lead nitrate addition reduces the detrimental effect of metallic sulfides,increases gold leaching recovery and or inhibits the dissolution of metallic sulfides,thus reduces cyanide consumption (Deschenes et al.2003).
