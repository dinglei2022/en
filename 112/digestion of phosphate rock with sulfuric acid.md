## Rock Phosphate Impurities And The Impact On Manufacturing.
This corresponds to free sulfate and is advantageous when calculating the sulfuric acid required digesting the phosphate rock.However,it is relatively constant at about 0.8% in most phosphate rocks.Effect of Impurities in Phosphoric Acid on the.duction is usually provided by acidulation of phosphate rock (wet process) in the phosphoric acid unit.Since the levels of impurities in different phosphate rocks are not the same,the produced phos phoric acid will also contain different amounts of these impurities.The concentrations of these species may have a strong effect on granulometery of the product.In some cases,too fine or too.
