## Author: Subject: Sulfuric acid from gypsum Sciencemadness
Oct 06,2013&nbsp&#0183&#32Sulfuric acid from gypsum I have made the following research: 2 CaSO4 + 2 SiO2 + C → 2 CaSiO3 + 2 SO2 + CO2 SO2 + O2 (V2O5@400600C) → SO3 SO3 + H2O → H2SO4 This dictates that 2720 grams of calcium sulfate would generate 1960 grams of 100% sulfuric acid by theory.The idea is that the gypsum is roasted with sand and coke at high temperatures.Acid Rain Department of ChemistryA chemical reaction (Equation 9) between calcium carbonate and sulfuric acid (the primary acid component of acid rain) results in the dissolution of CaCO 3 to give aqueous ions,which in turn are washed away in the water flow

When limestone is reacted with sulfuric acid to produce gypsum,the limestone and sulfuric acid,which are continuously fed to a reactor,are moved through the reactor and a discharger while rotating reactants and products in course of a gypsumforming process.Gypsum lumps are continuously obtained as a product thereby.Production of Gypsum Products from Waste Battery AcidProduction of Gypsum Products from Waste Battery Acid.G.M.Cann,P.A.Claisse &amp J.P.Lorimer.School of The Built Environment,Sir John Laing Building,Coventry University,UK.ABSTRACT: Leadacid batteries are the largest worldwide use of lead.Conventional recycling (95% in UK) produces harmful byproducts.

Calcium sulfate (or calcium sulphate) is the inorganic compound with the formula CaSO 4 and related hydrates.In the form of γanhydrite (the anhydrous form),it is used as a desiccant.One particular hydrate is better known as plaster of Paris,and another occurs naturally as the mineral gypsum.It has many uses in industry.All forms are white solids that are poorly soluble in water.SEMI BATCH PRECIPITATION OF CALCIUM,Semi batch precipitation of calcium sulfate dihydrate from calcite and sulfuric acid Frédéric Bard,Essaïd Bilal,SEMI BATCH PRECIPITATION OF CALCIUM SULFATE DIHYDRATE FROM CALCITE AND SULFURIC ACID Frédéric BARD1;,sulfuric acid and limestone instead of lime to lower
