## Difference Between Basalt and Granite Compare the
Aug 14,2011&nbsp&#0183&#32Summary Basalt vs Granite.Basalt and granite are two types of igneous rocks that we can find on earth.The key difference between basalt and granite is that basalt is mostly occurring on ocean floors,while granite is in the crust of the earth in all continents.Reference: 1."Basalt." Wikipedia,Wikimedia Foundation,13 Sept.2018.Electrical Resistivity of Some Basalt and Granite Samples. Eg MRSrocks like basalt and granite particularly under conditions likely to prevail at deeper levels in the.resistivity results on possible mantel constituents might yield further information about the temperature,composition,or conduction mechanisms in the mantel.be most suitable for the electrical properties investigation.
