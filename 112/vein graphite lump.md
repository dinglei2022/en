## Strategic graphite,a survey USGS
Strategic graphite consists of certain grades of lump and flake graphite for which the United States is largely or entirely dependent on sources abroad.Lump graphite of high purity,necessary in the manufacture of carbon brushes,is imported from Ceylon,where it occurs in vein deposits.Flake graphite,obtained from deposits consisting of graphite disseminated in schists and otherAbout Graphite Triton Minerals LtdLUMP VEIN.The rarest and most valuable form is vein graphite.This form of graphite is a true vein mineral as opposed to a seam mineral (amorphous graphite).Lump or vein graphite is usually found in high grade deposits and is highly sought after by both producers and customers.This is because purity is a key consideration.
