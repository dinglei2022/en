## Titanium Element information,properties and uses
The first titanium compound was identified by a Cornish vicar named William Gregor in 1791,when he extracted the impure oxide.He dissolved it in acid and got a colourless solution,but found that it could be reduced by zinc to make a purple solution.He was a transition metal chemist ahead of his time.How Is Titanium Obtained? ReferenceThe titanium oxide in these minerals must first be purified,then converted to titanium chloride,before titanium can be obtained.Titanium is the ninth most abundant element in the Earth's crust,but its mining and processing must be managed with expense and environmental concerns in mind.
