## SECTION FOUR HOW IS COAL USED?
Steam coal,also known as thermal coal,is used in power stations to generate electricity.The earliest conventional coal fired power stations used lump coal which was burnt on a grate in boilers to raise steam.Nowadays,the coal is first milled to a fine powder,which increases the surface area and allows it to burn more quickly.In these.2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Kenya plans to set up a 960MW coal fired power plant in Kitui and upon implementation it will be Kenya’s second coal project after Lamu coal plant.This is according to the treasury’s report for public private partnership (PPP) projects who has flagged the power plant as …Electricity production from coal sources (% of total) …Electricity production from coal sources (% of total) from The World Bank: Data 17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;South Africa has resolved to embrace efforts by businesses to generate their own electricity,due to growing frustrations by business to the constant power outages in the country.These nationwide power cuts have affected economic output and sapped investor confidence in …

The amount of fuel used to generate electricity depends on the efficiency or heat rate of the generator (or power plant) and the heat content of the fuel.Power plant efficiencies (heat rates) vary by types of generators (prime movers),power plant emission controls,and other factors.Kenya could provide itself completely with self produced energy.The total production of all electric energy producing facilities is 10 bn kWh,which is 123% of the countries own usage.Despite this,Kenya is trading energy with foreign countries.Along with pure consumptions the production,imports and exports play an important role.
