CONCRETE CALCULATOR How Much Do I Need? You can use this concrete calculator to help you determine the number of bags of QUIKRETE&#174 Concrete Mix,Mortar Mix,or FastSetting Concrete you will need for the following projects.How can we calculate the quantity of cement in m25 grade,Answer (1 of 5): Mix proportion for M25 grade of concrete is 1:1:2(cement:fine aggregates:coarse aggregates) So if you need 4cum of M25 concrete,we need to have 1cum ofcement 4 (1+1+2)=1 cum So,theoretically,for 1cum of M25 concrete,we need to have 025cum ofcement 1 (1+1+2)=025 cum

Concrete Mix Design Calculations Posted in Mix Design give me sir how to calculate mix design m25 m30 and how to calculate cube strenth and water cement ratio and soil test.Reply Link.Manoj panda July 26,2017 at 10:48 pm.Concrete Mix Design Calculation M20,M25,M30,06 09 2016&#0183;&#32;So,concrete mix design can be stated as Concrete Mix = Cement:Sand:Aggregat The concrete mix design involves various steps,calculations and laboratory testing to find right mix proportions This process is usually adopted for structures which requires higher grades of concrete such as M25 and above and large construction projects where quantity of concrete consumption is huge

## What is the maximum cement quantity for m25 grade concrete
Nov 04,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Answer by Mihir Salanke: Mix proportion for M25 grade of concrete is 1:1:2(cement:fine aggregates:coarse aggregates).So if you need 4cu.m of M25 concrete,we need to have 1cu.m of cement.So,theoretically,for 1cu.m of M25 concrete,we need to have 0.25cu.m of cement.But in practice,whenever we estimate quantity of cement for concrete
