## Quartzite: Metamorphic Rock Pictures,Definition &amp More
Quartzite as a RidgeFormer.Quartzite is one of the most physically durable and chemically resistant rocks found at Earth's surface.When the mountain ranges are worn down by weathering and erosion,lessresistant and lessdurable rocks are destroyed,but the quartzite remains.What Are the Five Properties of Rocks? ReferenceIn some types of rocks,such as sedimentary,shape may be used to describe the shape of the sediments within the rock.Texture explains how a rock feels.Smooth,rough,hard or soft are common descriptions.The texture of some rocks can be determined by looking at the rock as well as feeling it.It may look smooth or rough and feel the same way.
