## Perlite vs Vermiculite,What's the Difference + what you
The particles of vermiculite can be expanded by heat,allowing it to hold more water than its original volume.The surface area of a perlite is larger than a corner and there are cracks in the perlite for water storage.Also,its porous ability helps plants drain excess water for better aeration.Perlite WikipediaPerlite is an amorphous volcanic glass that has a relatively high water content,typically formed by the hydration of obsidian.It occurs naturally and has the unusual property of greatly expanding when heated sufficiently.It is an industrial mineral and a commercial product useful for its low density after processing.

## Expanded Perlite Insulation: Why Hydrophobicity is Only
Apr 05,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Expanded perlite is hydrophobic,and it has an inherent chemical makeup that actively inhibits corrosion.The dual nature of perlite allows it to work to prevent CUI even after elevated temperatures (greater than 450&#176F or 232&#176C) have oxidized the organic ingredients that make the insulation hydrophobic.Understanding the Performance Differences Between ExpandedJul 26,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32The reason perlite insulation is technically referred to as "expanded perlite" is because when it is heated during the manufacturing process (to approximately 1600&#176F 900&#176C) the moisture expands,causing it to pop like popcorn at 1600&#176F.This makes perlite a very lowdensity material that is lightweight,with low thermal conductivity values.
