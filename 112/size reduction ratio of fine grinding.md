## CPE: Lesson 13.Principle of Size Reduction
Reduction ratios depend on the specific type of equipment.As a general rule,the coarser the reduction,the smaller the ratio.For example,coarse crushers have size reduction ratios of below 8:1,while fine grinders may present ratios as high as 100:1.filling ratio of grinding mill greenplanetfaxOct 10,2015 &#183 The first mechanical activation experiments were realized in a ball mill with the size of 䳯 &#215 305 mm internal diameter (smooth walled),with uniform distribution steel balls (ball size 12 50 mm) as grinding media.The mill filling ratio of the grinding media was 30 V V%,the material filling ratio was 110 V V%.Get Price

## Ball mill Wikipedia
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotatiCERAMIC MATERIALS I metalurji.mu.edu.trAsst.Prof.Dr.Ayşe KALEMTAŞ COMMINUTION Comminution entails reducing the particle size of the raw material by crushing,grinding,and milling or fine grinding.In mineral processing parlance,comminution in coarse range is known as "crushing" and in fine range it is called "grinding".Comminution : The act or process of reduction of particle size with
