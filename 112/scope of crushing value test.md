• The crushing strength of aggregate cannot be tested with any direct test.There are some indirect tests to inform us about the crushing strength of aggregate. Test method: Crushing value test Other Mechanical Properties of Aggregates: a) Impact value: Impact value of aggregates measures the toughness of particles by impact.Total 54 14objective aggregate crushing value testthe objectives of determining the crushing value of aggregate Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) Civil Engineering Laboratory,The aggregate Impact value gives a relative measure of the resistance,This test method covers the determination of the CBR.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test
The Aggregate Crushing Value Test is a numerical index of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load.Step : Level off the surface and place the plunger over it so that it rests horizontally on the surface of the aggregates.Aggregate Crushing ValueAggregate Crushing value depends on the shape of agg also.Angular aggregates have a lower ACV,than Irregular or rounded aggregates.If we cut a core out of the same agg (Say in the quarry) and test for compressive strength,will give a higher MPa value.It can.
