## spontaneous potential survey of a copper deposit at sariyer,turkey
auriferous pyrite deposits in the Sariyer area of Turkey.The spontaneous polarization method was found to be suitable for locating such deposits.The anomalies.Characterizing the distribution of gold in pyritic sulfide ore.Abstract.Auriferous pyrite is an important ore in the Green's Creek polymetallic sulfide deposit.Pyritic ores have textural and crystal forms that range from.

## Optimisation of fine auriferous pyrite recovery using
2016828&ensp&#0183&enspABSTRACTThe beneficial effects of the synergy between two or more anionic reagents have long been known.The purpose is to increase both the recovery and selectivity.In this study,the flotation of fine auriferous pyrite particles (&lt38 μm) was studied using a mixture of anionic and nonionic collectors.When Z105 was used for nonionic collector and mixed with anionic reagents,theKeystone Mine (MRDS #10310635) AUGold occurs as free gold in quartz and as auriferous pyrite and arsenopyrite.Quartz is the dominant mineral component in the veins,comprising 8090% or more with ankerite,arsenopyrite,pyrite,albite,calcite,dolomite,sericite,apatite,chlorite,sphalerite,galena,and chalcopyrite in
