Planetary Ball Mills are used wherever the highest degree of fineness is required.Apart from the classical mixing and size reduction processes,the mills also meet all the technical requirements for colloidal grinding and have the energy input necessary for mechanical alloying processes.The extremely high centrifugal forces of planetary ball mills result in very high pulverization energy andBall and Race Mill ~ ME MechanicalJul 07,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32In ball and race mill the coal passes between the rotating elements again and again until it is pulverized to the desired degree of fineness.The coal is crushed between two moving surfaces namely balls and races.A worm and gear drove the upper stationary race,and the lower rotating race holds the balls between them.
