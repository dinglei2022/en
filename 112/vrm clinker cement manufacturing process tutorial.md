## 116 Portland Cement Manufacturing
Aug 17,1971&#0183;&#32;Portland cement accounts for 95 percent of the hydraulic cement production in the United Stat The balance of domestic cement production is primarily masonry cement Both of these materials are produced in portland cement manufacturing plants A diagram of the process,which encompasses production of both portland and masonry cement,is shown.How Cement Is MadeCement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains.The cement is now ready for transport to readymix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects.Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement,some kilns in the United States use a wet process.

Due to the very high temperatures and the high fineness of the material required for efficient processing,the cement manufacturing process requires large amount of heat and electrical energy.Modern Cement Plants employ high efficiency Vertical Roller Mills (VRM's) for material grinding and capture and recycle as much waste heat as possible.Technological Energy Efficiency Improvements in Cement,As stated by Su et al [],the cement manufacturing process can be divided into three major stages: raw material processing,clinker production,and finish grinding processing (finished cement production)A schematic representation of the cement production process is illustrated in Figure 1The raw material processing reduces the size of limestone and clay,
