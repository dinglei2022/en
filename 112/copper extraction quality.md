## A Review on Novel Techniques for Chalcopyrite Ore Processing
Currently,copper is extracted from highgrade chalcopyrite through smelting a high temperature process with undesirable environmental side effects (Thomas,2009) The world's production (supply) and consumption (demand) of chalcopyrite (copper) have increased dramatically in the past 25 years.SX Solvent Extraction of Metals: A Design ManualCopper Recovery by Solvent Extraction.A common method of copper recovery from oxide ores is dump leaching in which the excavated ore is crushed and dumped on an impervious surface in "lifts" of anything from 10 to 100 ft deep.Sulphuric acid is sprayed onto the levelled off dump via a network of pipes designed to give even distribution.
