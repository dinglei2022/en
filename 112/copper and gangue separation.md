## Gravity Separation & Purification Of Native Copper
Gravity Separation & Purification Of Native Copper Native copper is kind of sulfide mineral with the main composition mainly FeS2,that is to say,the native copper is kind of sulfide mineral of copper and iron with metal luster,crisp and easy to break and broken section of saw tooth waveFroth flotation WikipediaFroth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.Froth flotation is a process for separating minerals from gangue by taking advantage of differences in their hydrophobicity.Hydrophobicity.By 1991,the average grade of copper ore mined in the US had fallen to only 0.6 percent.
