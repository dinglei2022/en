Two Categories of Metal Casting Processes 1.Expendable mold processes mold is sacrificed to remove part Advantage: more complex shapes possible Disadvantage: production rates often limited by time to make mold rather than casting itself 2.Permanent mold processes mold is made of metal and can be used to make many castingsCHAPTER 3.9 FUNDAMENTALS OF CONTINUOUS CASTING:Download CHAPTER 3.9 FUNDAMENTALS OF CONTINUOUS CASTING: MODELING book pdf free download link or read online here in PDF.Read online CHAPTER 3.9 FUNDAMENTALS OF CONTINUOUS CASTING: MODELING book pdf free download link book now.All books are in clear copy here,and all files are secure so don't worry about it.
