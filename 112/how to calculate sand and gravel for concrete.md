## How to estimate the quantity of cement sand aggregate in 1
Hi,We use minimum grade of concrete for RCC = M20.For M20,GRADE = 1:1.5:3 Volume of Concrete = L x B x D= 1 cum.Wet Volume of concrete = 1 cum Dry volume of concrete = 1.52 x 1 = 1.52 cum.Ratio = 1:1.5:3 = 5.5 * Cement = 1.52[ 1 (1+1.5+3)]How much cement would I need?My sand gravel is in a cone shaped pile and I know how to calculate that.I found some information on the web on pouring concrete that helps answer your.
