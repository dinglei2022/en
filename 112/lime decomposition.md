It makes your poop smell like used motor oil.share:Maintaining the Outhouse: How to Treat Outhouse WasteA type of lime called calcium hydroxide,available at feed stores,can be dropped down the hole to reduce odor.But lime might halt decomposition.Ash from a woodburning stove is better for decomposition,but less effective on odors.In either case,a surgical mask or bandana can protect you from the dust cloud that is sure to come back at you.
