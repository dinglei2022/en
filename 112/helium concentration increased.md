The helium suicide method has been used widely,including reportedly by reputable organisations like Dignitas.(Dignitas now uses only a drink of 15 grams of pentobarbital sodium: trade name Nembutal).The helium method is based on the fact that breathing inert gas like helium does not produce any feeling of suffoion,but depletes the body of oxygen,leading to loss of consciousness and death.4 Helium Supply,Present and Future The Impact ofAlthough the total terrestrial inventory of helium is estimated to be 17,000 trillion scf (470 trillion scm),most of this supply is in Earth's atmosphere at a concentration of only 5 ppm.Atmospheric helium is in dynamic equilibrium between the gain of helium diffusing from Earth's crust (as a
