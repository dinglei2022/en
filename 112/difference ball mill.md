## difference between the vertical mill and the ball mill.
The ball mill is easy to over grind,the limestone unit wear is generally 4 6 g ton,and the ball mill is up to 500 g ton.4) When grinding white minerals by vertical grinding,the effect on whiteness is much smaller than that of ball mills.8,environmental impact 1) Vertical grinding is at work,the sound is soft,generally around 80 decibels.What is the cleaning process for balls in Ball mill process?For cleaning the balls in ball mill process,I'm doing ultrasonic cleaning with DI water,Acetone,and IPA (1 hour each) consequently.Whats the standard cleaning process? also the balls are Agate.
