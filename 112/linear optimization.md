linear dependencies in many situations can be considered as quite satisfactory approximations of actual nonlinear dependencies.At the same time,a linear dependence is easy to specify,which makes it realistic to specify data of Linear Optimization models with many variables and constraintsLinear Programming from Wolfram MathWorldLinear programming,sometimes known as linear optimization,is the problem of maximizing or minimizing a linear function over a convex polyhedron specified by linear and nonnegativity constraints.Simplistically,linear programming is the optimization of an outcome based on some set of constraints using a linear mathematical model.Linear programming is implemented in the Wolfram Language
