## 1.1 PHASES OF A MINING PROJECT Home ELAW
1.1 PHASES OF A MINING PROJECT There are different phases of a mining project,beginning with mineral ore exploration and ending with the postclosure period.What follows are the typical phases of a proposed mining project.Each phase of mining is associated with different sets of environmental impacts.1.1.1 ExplorationBauxite tailings WikipediaBauxite tailings,also known as red mud,red sludge,bauxite residue,or alumina refinery residues (ARR),is a highly alkaline waste product composed mainly of iron oxide that is generated in the industrial production of alumina (aluminium oxide,the principal raw material used in the manufacture of aluminium metal and also widely used in the manufacture of ceramics,abrasives and refractories).

## Bauxite Mining and Alumina Refining: Process Description
PROCESS DESCRIPTION: BAUXITE MINING.Bauxite is the principal ore of alumina (Al 2 O 3),which is used to produce aluminum (Al).It is composed of hydrated aluminum oxides,hydrated aluminosilies,iron oxides,hydrated iron oxides,titanium oxide,and silica.Washing and beneficiation (further treatment of the ore to concentrate theAluminum Smelting Furnaces and Processing of Bauxite OreThe smelting of aluminum begins with the extraction of bauxite ore by a form of open cast mining.The bauxite is washed and screened before being converted to alumina,a white powdery element from which the aluminum is produced.Aluminum smelting is carried out in a Hall Heroult reduction cell,which is lined with carbon.A mix of alumina and cryolite is fed into the cell and carbon blocks

## Aluminium future out of red mud treatment CSIRO
Aluminium future out of red mud treatment Researchers from CSIRO's Mineral Resources Flagship have developed a process that lowers the cost of refining bauxite (aluminium ore) to alumina (aluminium oxide) by treating the waste product generated—red mud—to recover a costly ingredient,caustic soda.Bauxite mining and refiningGAC Boke Bauxite Project,Guinea miningtechnologyMining and ore processing at Boke project.Conventional openpit method of mining involving drilling and blasting will be applied at GAC Boke bauxite project to extract exportgrade product.Initial mining operations at the project will be focused on plateaus 20,24,26,27,and 31,with operations extended to other plateaus in future.
