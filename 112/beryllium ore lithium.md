Apr 25,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Beryllium is a hard and light metal that has a high melting point and unique nuclear properties,which make it vital to numerous aerospace and military appliions.Characteristics: Pure beryllium is an extremely light,strong and brittle metal.With a density of 1.85g cm 3,beryllium is the second lightest elemental metal,behind only lithiumAbout Beryllium Properties and its UsesSources of Beryllium.Where does Beryllium come from? Only the United States,China and Kazakhstan process commercial quantities of beryllium from ore into pure beryllium metal or other berylliumcontaining materials.Currently,the only fully integrated producer (from mine to mill fabriion),Materion Brush Inc.is loed in the U.S.

## Lithium Wikipedia
Lithium salts are extracted from water in mineral springs,brine pools,and brine deposits.Brine excavation is probably the only lithium extraction technology widely used today,as actual mining of lithium ores is much more expensive and has been priced out of the market.Beryllium aluminum silie Article about Berylliumberyl (bĕr`ĭl),mineral,a silie of beryllium and aluminum,Be 3 Al 2 Si 6 O 18,extremely hard,occurring in hexagonal crystals that may be of enormous size and are usually white,yellow,green,blue,or colorless.Beryl is commonly used as a gemstone.The refractive index is low,and the stones have little or no fire.The most valued variety of beryl is emerald emerald,

## Mineral Commodity Report 19 Beryllium,Gallium,Lithium
Beryllium was first called glucinum from the Greek glykys,for sweet,because the soluble compounds are sweettasting.However,W&#246hler established the name beryllium,after the chief mineral beryl,named from the Greek beryllos.Major ores and minerals Beryllium does not occur free inWhy is lithium more reactive than beryllium answersLithium reacts readily with water,where Beryllium does not.Lithium has a fairly low melting point,and Beryllium has a high melting point.Beryllium is highly toxic,and Lithium is fairly nontoxic.
