## Magnetic Separation SBM Mining and Construction Machinery
Magnetic Separation.The magnetic separator consists of a large rotating drum,in which permanent magnets are wrapped and fixed,so it creates a magnetic field.When materials enter the feeding cell,sensitive particles will respond to the magnetism and stick to the drum.As the drum rotates,the magnetism will become weaker and weaker.Stearns Magnetic Separation Equipment Brochure Ohio MagneticsThe Stearns™ brand of magnetic separation equipment includes electric magnetic drums for auto shredders,electric or permanent over the belt magnets.
