## Coal dust
Coal dust is a fine powdered form of coal,which is created by the crushing,grinding,or pulverizing of coal.Because of the brittle nature of coal,coal dust can be created during mining,transportation,or by mechanically handling coal.It is a form of fugitive dust.Mining Industry Archives Page 6 of 8C.Dong,M.Bi,and Y.Zhou,"Effects of obstacles and deposited coal dust on characteristics of premixed methaneair explosions in a long closed pipe," Safety science,vol.50,p.1786 1791,2012.
