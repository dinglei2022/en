If the hydrocyclone liner becomes damaged,the material which finds its way between the liner and the cyclone shell will begin to 'weep' from these holes,indiing that the liner needs to be replaced.This drastically reduces unplanned stoppages and will extend the life of the hydrocyclone's steel shells.(PDF) Industrial Appliion of Valuable MaterialsIndustrial Appliion of Valuable Materials Generated from PLK RockA Bauxite Mining Waste.pdf.IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering.For this minihydrocyclone,the

## Hydrocyclone Working Principle
The third type of classifiion used in mining is the Hydrocyclone,commonly called a Cyclone.Unlike the others it has no moving parts and is worked in conjunction of another piece of equipment,a pump.To understand the Hydrocyclone Working Principle we must first know its components.Beginning at the top,there is the OVERFLOW DISCHARGE.ChemIndustrial Systems Hydrocyclone FeaturesHydrocyclones don't work for all separations.Even when hydrocyclones work well,it is rare for them to achieve perfect separation.Expect some heavies in the overflow and always some lights in the underflow.Hydrocyclones are not good at handling variable flow rates.
