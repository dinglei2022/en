Carnegie made major technological innovations in the 1880s,especially the installation of the open hearth furnace system at Homestead in 1886.It now became possible to make steel suitable for structural beams and for armor plate for the US Navy,which paid far higher prices for the premium product.In addition the plant&nbsp;.History of the steel industry (1850 1970) WikipediaThe history of the modern steel industry began in the late 1850s,but since then,steel has been basic to the world&#39;s industrial economy.This article is intended only to address the business,economic and social dimensions of the industry,since the bulk production of steel began as a result of Henry Bessemer&#39;s development&nbsp;.

## Open hearth furnace Wikipedia
Open hearth furnaces are one of a number of kinds of furnace where excess carbon and other impurities are burnt out of pig iron to produce steel.Since steel is difficult to manufacture due to its high melting point,normal fuels and furnaces were insufficient and the open hearth furnace was developed to overcome this difficulty.Compared to Bessemer steel,which it displaced,its mainUS epa.govThe integrated iron and steel industry produces coke using the byproduct process.This process.will.not be found at plants which produce steel only via the electric arc furnace process.Plants producing steel via the basic oxygen furnace or open hearth furnace process.will.

The first duplex steel in the United States was made here in 1899.So named because it was first produced in a Bessemer convertor then transferred to open hearth furnaces,the duplex process was later adopted widely at many major steel mills including the Duquesne plant of U.S.Steel.History of USS Duluth WorksAn invisible outpost of the once expansive United States Steel (USS) empire was American Steel &amp Wire's Duluth Works.This integrated mill was loed a mere 70 miles from the world's greatest source of iron ore,the Mesabi Range.But,that was not the reason why this steel mill was built.
