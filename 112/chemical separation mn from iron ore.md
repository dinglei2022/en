## Manganese Wikipedia
Manganese is a chemical element with the symbol Mn and atomic number 25.It is not found as a free element in nature it is often found in minerals in combination with iron.Manganese is a transition metal with important industrial alloy uses,particularly in stainless steels.Historically,manganese is named for pyrolusite and other black minerals from the region of Magnesia in Greece,whichMineral Processing Natural Resources Research InstituteVideo of ColeraineFinalEdit 1 This program conducts a wide variety of mining industry benchtopilot scale studies related to crushing,grinding,screening and mineral separation (both gravity separation and chemical flotation) for a wide variety of ferrous and nonferrous mineral types.
