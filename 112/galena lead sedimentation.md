## Mine Waste as a Source of Galena River Bed Sediment The
Accelerated soil erosion,resulting from agriculture,has increased the rates of sedimentation in many streams and valleys in various parts of the United States.In the Galena River Valley,in southwestern Wisconsin and northwestern Illinois,the effect of soil erosion is complied by sediment produced by mine wastes and tailings of the lead and zincmining industry.Lead Mining Wisconsin,United States (19th cIn an ironic twist of fate,the lower Galena River accrued so much sediment due to the erosive effects of lead mining,that the lead mining boomtown town of Galena,with aspirations of becoming a major Mississippi river port,became unreachable by steamer by the mid1840s,dashing its hopes of being a significant port city.
