## What Does Acid Rain Do to Limestone? eHow
Acid rain that seeps into the subsurface through soil penetration or stream loss can dissolve underground limestone rocks.As acidic water encounters limestone,it infiltrates cracks in the rock and begins to erode the rock below ground.What Does Acid Rain Do to Limestone? eHowAcid rain is a byproduct of both natural and man made conditions.In the atmosphere,rain mixes with carbon dioxide,nitrous oxide and sulfuric dioxide to form acid rain.These constituents may occur naturally from processes such as volcanic eruptions and the oxidation of rocks,or their presence in.
