## The Aggregate Manufacturing Process General Kinematics
Steady increase in overexploitation of stone quarries,generation of construction and demolition waste,and costs of preparing extra landfill space have become environmental and waste management challenges in metropolises.In this paper,aggregate production is studied in two scenarios: scenario 1 representing the production of natural aggregates (NA) and scenario 2 representing the production.Classification of Aggregates Based on Size and Shape,Classification of Aggregates Based on Shape We know that aggregate is derived from naturally occurring rocks by blasting or crushing etc,so,it is difficult to attain required shape of aggregate But,the shape of aggregate will affect the workability of concrete So,we should take care about the shape of aggregate

## 3 Aggregate Properties
4 AGGREGATE VOIDS There are aggregate particle voids,and there are voids between aggregate particles.As solid as aggregate may be to the naked eye,most aggregate particles have voids,which are natural pores that are filled with air or water.These voidsHow to Process Sand gravel Aggregate? HXJQThe crushed aggregate is divided into high quality recycled aggregate of 5 20 mm by secondary screening,which can be used in the concrete manufacturing of C25 C30.The high quality recycled fine aggregate of 0.15 mm 5 mm and the fine powder of 0.15 mm or less are selected by tertiary screening.

## Construction aggregate
Meanwhile,granite aggregates between 4.5 and 9.5 mm (Fig.1b) were used as natural aggregates (NA).The aggregate size between 4.5 and 9.5 mm was chosen as it was reported that a relatively smaller amount of cement paste is sufficient to coat the).
