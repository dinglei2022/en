By Robert A.Sladky Vice President Tube Mill Engineering Many “W” style mills that have the ability to shim up the bottom driven shafts in each section to maintain metal line after tooling is reworked,and are many times also equipped with a individual motor drive in each of the three sections as illustrated below.ALGORITHMS FOR SPEED AND STRETCH CONTROL OF THE …Key words: Speed and stretch control,Stretch reducing tube mill (SRM).This paper shows the drive solution,the speed references calculation and the automatic control of all speeds range for the assembly of the 24 stands belonging to a stretch reducing mill for seamless pipes.The correlation between the speed control
