## Columbitetantalite (COLTAN) &gt ENGINEERING
Columbitetantalite (COLTAN) Staff posted on October 17,2006 COLTAN (ColumbiteTantalite) is a dull metallic ore found in major quantities in the eastern areas of Congo.When refined,COLTAN becomes metallic Tantalum,a heatresistant powder that can hold a high electrical charge.There is now an alternative to solid tantalum capacitors2017329&ensp&#0183&enspThe combination of low ESR with higher voltage,stability and frequency,in addition to more stable and ethical sourcing of the tantalum ore,means that designers can now apply the benefits of polymer tantalum technology across a wider range of appliions.Roger Tall works for Charcroft

## Tantalum
The major use of metallic tantalum is in the manufacture of electronic components,mainly tantalum capacitors.Because of their long shelf life and reliability,these capacitors are used in computers,communiion systems,and controls and instruments for aircraft,missiles,ships,and weapon systems.Facts,pictures,stories about the element Tantalum in theTantalite is of course named for its major component,tantalum.Coltan is a major ore for tantalum,used in capacitors found in nearly all digital electronics,including cell phones (and computers and talking dolls and defibrillators and pretty much everything else invented since 1980).

## Tantalum Wikipedia
Tantalum is a chemical element with the symbol Ta and atomic number 73.Previously known as tantalium,its name comes from Tantalus,a villain from Greek mythology.Tantalum is a rare,hard,bluegray,lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosionresistant.Mineral Resource of the Month: Tantalum EARTH MagazineTantalum minerals contain 12 to 84 percent tantalum pentoxide however,tantalum ores are low grade and contain only 0.01 to 1 percent tantalum pentoxide,which is equivalent to 0.1 to 10 kilograms per metric ton.As a result,to produce concentrates of tantalum,tantalite ore must be separated from other minerals in the ore.
