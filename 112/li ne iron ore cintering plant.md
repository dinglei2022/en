## Blastfurnace.Operation of blast furnace.Metallurgy.
Blast furnace Produces pig iron from iron ore and sinter.The iron oxide of ore and sinter is reduced to iron with the help of carbon monoxide(Co) which is produced inside the furnace by the action of hot air at about 1000.oC with coke.Another purpose of coke is to supply heat for reaction and melting ironIron ore pelletizing systems MetsoIron ore pelletizing systems.Iron ore fines are agglomerated into pellets and then indurated using a furnace to create iron ore pellets.These are typically fed to a blast furnace or DRI plant as part of the process to make steel.
