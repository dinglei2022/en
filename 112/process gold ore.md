## How Gold Is Mined Gold Mining Process World Gold Council
Yet mining the ore is just one stage in a long and complex gold mining process Long before any gold can be extracted,significant exploration and development needs to take place,both to determine,as accurately as possible,the size of the deposit as well as how to extract and process the ore efficiently,safely and responsiblyGold Mining Process Development Denver Mineral EngineersCyanide process is also called as Macarthur forest Process It is the process of extracting gold or silver from the ores by dissolving in a dilute solution of potassium cyanide or sodium cyanide This process was introduced in the year 1887 by the Scottish chemists naming Robert W Forrest,John S MacArthur,and William Forrest

## How Is Gold Extracted From Gold Ore? Sciencing
Gold is usually found alone or alloyed with mercury or silver,but can also be found in ores such as calaverite,sylvanite,nagyagite,petzite and krennerite.Most gold ore now comes from either open pit or underground mines.The ores sometimes contain as little as 5 100 of an ounce of goldSmelting Gold Commodity ChainSmelting gold is accomplished by using high pressure,heat and various chemicals to breakdown the ore and melt the gold to separate it from the impuriti The gold must be heated to an excess of 1046 degrees Celsius or 2150 degrees Fahrenheit Gold ore before melting process Burning off impuriti Smelting gold is a very dangerous process
