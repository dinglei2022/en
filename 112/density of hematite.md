## What is the density of iron ore Answers.com
The density of iron ore is variable.Iron ore refers to a rocktype that contains iron minerals.The type and concentration of the iron minerals as well the type and concentration of non iron minerals determines the density of the iron ore.Typical high grade iron ore is approximately 65% hematite.Magnetite WikipediaMagnetite reacts with oxygen to produce hematite,and the mineral pair forms a buffer that can control oxygen fugacity.Commonly,igneous rocks contain solid solutions of both titanomagnetite and hemoilmenite or titanohematite.

## Hematite Gemstone Information GemSelect
Hematite is a gemstone form of iron oxide.It is the principal ore of iron and one of the few gemstones that exhibits a metallic luster.Like most other gemstones with a metallic luster,hematite is remarkably dense and possesses an extremely high refractive index.In fact,its specific gravity and refractive index is much higher than that of corundum,zircon and even diamond.Suspect Meteorite Tests Meteorite Identification Home Page观看视频 · hematite streaks red.magnetite streaks black.If you are able to calculate the density of your suspect meteorite,that information may help you to identify it.

## Magnetite: Magnetite mineral information and data.
Magnetite is an important iron ore,along with hematite.Nanoinclusions of magnetite crystals cause the iridescence of Rainbow obsidian (Nadin,2007).Extremely thin layers of 200 nm octahedral crystals of magnetite give some basalt surfaces an iridescent sheen (Nadin,2007).
