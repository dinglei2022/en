## Hematite after Magnetite (#43) Geology Department Displays
But if you touch a magnet to it,nothing will happen If you rub it on a streak plate,the streak will be bright to dark red brown You will think it is not magnetite,and you will be correct As specimen #37 is a pseudomorph,this specimen is a pseudomorph of hematite after magnetiteNanophase magnetite and pyrrhotite in ALH84001 Martian,magnetite,Mg siderite and pyrite (both components of ALH84001) were heated individually or together in open and closed systems at 550ºC for 1 h,and at 350ºC for 9 d for selected treatments

## Magnetic Susceptibility of Minerals in High Magnetic Fields
magnetic field is dependent in part upon the magnetic susceptibility of the particle If two minerals of equal vol&#173; ume but different susceptibilities are exposed to the same magnetic field and field gradient,the resulting difference in magnetic forces will 'result in a separation of the par&#173; ticles if enough time is allowed
