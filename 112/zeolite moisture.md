## Peter MAIERLAXHUBER,et al.: Zeolite water adsorbtion
Zeolite water sorption systems can now provide a reliable and economic solution for these cooling needs.The equipment consists of a refrigerator (in this case a 55 liter boxshaped cooler),powered by solar energy,with a builtin evaporator,one or more zeolite containers and a parabolic,concentrating solar collector,developed by E.G.Solar.DIY Dehumidifier: And Other Ways to Deal with IndoorZeolite rocks don't usually need the bucket setup since they absorb the moisture into the rock itself,but if there is too much moisture,they can produce puddles.The cool thing about zeolite is that they can be left out in sunlight and the moisture will evaporate.You can use them over and over.Let me know if you have any more questions.

## What is Zeolite (Clinoptilolite)? Standlee Premium
Zeolite granules have the ability to absorb up to 60% of its weight in moisture and the net negative charge acts like a magnet attracting positively charged compounds (like ammonia).Zeolite eliminates them by exchanging ions and neutralizing the compound.These benefits make itMineral Soil Amendment Zeolite Supplier: ClinoptiloliteZeolite's distinguished properties on CEC,free structural water storage,and surface adsorption have great potential appliions on soil ameliorating.During the 1960s,Japanese farmers used Zeolite to control the moisture content and odor of animal waste while increasing the pH level of their acidic volcanic soils when spreading manure.
