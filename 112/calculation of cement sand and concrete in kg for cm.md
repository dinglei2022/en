## Concrete Calculator Find Out How Many Yards You Need
Quickly calculate concrete slab and footing pours by entering the depth,width and length to find the number of cubic yards or bags of concrete needed for your project.Give these calculations to your readymix supplier or use them to estimate how many 40,60 or 80 lb.bags of concrete to buy.How To Calculate Quantities Of Cement,Sand And AggregateStep3: Calculate Material requirement for producing 1 cum Concrete.From the above calculation,we have already got the weights of individual ingredients in concrete.So,the weight of concrete produced with 1 Bag of cement (50 Kgs) =50 kg + 115 kg + 209 kg + 27.5 kg = 401.5 kg ~ 400 kgs.Considering concrete density = 2400 kg cum,
