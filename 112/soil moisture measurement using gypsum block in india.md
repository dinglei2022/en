## Useful Tools to Determine Soil Moisture Status II: Gypsum
Aug 30,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32Another tool for measuring soil moisture are gypsum blocks.Gypsum is a porous material that equilibrates with soil water similar to the ceramic tips of the tensiometers.In this case two electrodes are embedding in the gypsum block in a cylindrical or parallel mode (Figure 1).Reducing Water Waste with Soil Moisture MetersNov 15,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32By tracking how much moisture is available to plants in the soil,a soil moisture meter with gypsum blocks helps farmers optimize their irrigation routines.If the readings of soil moisture indie that the soil is already near full saturation for water,then the farmer will know that they can scale back how much water they use for irrigation.

The gypsum manufacturing process requires that the finished gypsum board be very dry in moisture content,hence the alternate name drywall.While there is no industry standard or regulatory source specifying this moisture level,it is generally thought that a level below or about 1% is appropriate.Methods of Soil Moisture Estimation Methods : LaboratorySensitivity of a tensiometer is only up to 0.85 atmospheres while available soil moisture range is up to atmosphere and hence is useful more on sandy soils wherein about 80% of available water is held within 0.85 ranges.2) Gypsum Blocks: Gypsum blocks or plaster of Paris resistance units are used for measurement of soil moisture is situ.These

## Soil moisture sensor Wikipedia
Soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content in soil.Since the direct gravimetric measurement of free soil moisture requires removing,drying,and weighting of a sample,soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content indirectly by using some other property of the soil,such as electrical resistance,dielectric constant,or interaction with neutrons,as a proxy forIrrometer Soil Moisture BasicsUsing the Information.Management The key element in proper soil moisture measurement is the operator.Taking the time to interpret your sensor readings will give you a vivid picture of what is happening with the soil moisture in the root system of your crop.

## How to Measure Soil Moisture: Top 3 Methods
Gypsum is found to be less sensitive to soil salts than nylon and fibre glass because of the concentration of soluble gypsum within the water of a gypsum block.In general nylon and fibre glass units are more sensitive than gypsum blocks at high moisture content and low tension conditions.Performance evaluation of gypsum block wireless sensorThe measurements of soil moisture by gypsum block sensor involve conversion of resistivity to soil matric potential and its conversion to volumetric soil moisture content (Ganjegunte,Sheng,&amp Clark,2012 Nagy et al.2013 Shock et al.1998).These sensors can measure the soil moisture tension varying from 10 to 200kPa,which cor
