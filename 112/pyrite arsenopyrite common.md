## Pyrite Mineral Uses and Properties
Pyrite is so common that many geologists would consider it to be a ubiquitous mineral.The name &quotpyrite&quot is after the Greek &quotpyr&quot meaning &quotfire.&quot This name was given because pyrite can be used to create the sparks needed for starting a fire if it is struck against metal or another hard material.Arsenopyrite an overview ScienceDirect TopicsOther common element associations may assist in deposit detection at the more detailed primary ore deposit scale.Pathfinder elements for gold include As,Ba,Bi,Cu,Ag,Te and W.Arsenic is the bestknown indior for gold because of its common association with arsenopyrite or arsenicbearing pyrite.
