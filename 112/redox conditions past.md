## Redox Wikipedia
Redox (short for reduction oxidation reaction) (pronunciation: ˈrɛdɒks redoks or ˈriːdɒks reedoks) is a chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed.Any such reaction involves both a reduction process and a complementary oxidation process,two key concepts involved with electron transfer&nbsp;.A Holocene history of dynamic water column redox conditions in the.Abstract.The modern Baltic Sea is the world&#39;s largest anthropogenically forced anoxic basin.Using integrated geochemical records collected during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 347 from the deepest and one of the most reducing sub basins in the Baltic Sea,Landsort Deep,we explore the degree&nbsp;.
