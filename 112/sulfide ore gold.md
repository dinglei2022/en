## Leachox™ Refractory and Sulphide Gold Process Maelgwyn
Refractory gold ores are generally defined as those ores that do not give economical recoveries in conventional cyanide circuits where the ore has been ground to around 53 to 75 microns.The gold is normally present in refractory gold sulphide ores containing mainly pyrite,arsenopyrite or pyrrhotite and occurs in both the chemically bondedGold processing BritannicaWhen present in sulfide ore bodies,the gold,although still elemental in form,is so finely disseminated that concentration by methods such as those applied to alluvial gold is impossible.Native gold is the most common mineral of gold,accounting for about 80 percent of the metal in the Earth's crust.

## Roasting (metallurgy) Wikipedia
Roasting is a process of heating of sulfide ore to a high temperature in presence of air.It is a step of the processing of certain ores.More specifically,roasting is a metallurgical process involving gas solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s).Often before roasting,the ore has already been partially purified,e.g.by froth flotation.Copper Ore Types: Sulfides vs.Oxides Investing News NetworkBoth ore types can be economically mined,though they are processed in different ways.Copper sulfide ores are typically the most profitable types of copper ores to mine.That is because they have
