## Cobalt Metal Characteristics thebalance
Cobalt naturally occurs in nickelbearing laterites and nickelcopper sulfide deposits and,thus,is most often extracted as a byproduct of nickel and copper.According to the Cobalt Development Institute,about 48% of cobalt production originates from nickel ores,37% from copper ores and 15% from primary cobalt production.Perspectives on Advanced Interconnect Developments LamJun 20,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32One example is replacing tantalumbased liners with a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) cobalt liner in order to improve the bulk copper fill and reliability,thereby extending the use of copper.A wide range of interconnect materials such as copper alloys,cobalt,ruthenium,nickel,and others are also being explored to lower resistance.

## Cobalt Wikipedia
Cobalt is a chemical element with the symbol Co and atomic number 27.Like nickel,cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in chemically combined form,save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron.The free element,produced by reductive smelting,is a hard,lustrous,silvergray metal.Cobaltbased blue pigments (cobalt blue) have been used since ancient times forNickelcobalt electroforming process Q&ampA'sNickelcobalt electroforming process Q&ampA's.A discussion started in 1995 but continuing through 2017.1995.Q.I am looking for a transfer of technology and supply of equipment for electroforming.We are a mold and die manufacturer looking for implementation of this technology in our facility.

## Production and Supply Cobalt Institute
Cobalt is widely stered in the earth's crust and is found in a variety of different ores in several countries.Cobalt is only extracted alone from the Moroccan and some Canadian arsenide ores.It is normally associated as a byproduct of copper or nickel mining operations.Around 55% of the world cobalt production comes from nickel ores.
