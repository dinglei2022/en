## Tool steel Wikipedia
Tool steel refers to a variety of carbon and alloy steels that are particularly wellsuited to be made into tools.Their suitability comes from their distinctive hardness,resistance to abrasion and deformation,and their ability to hold a cutting edge at elevated temperatures.As a result,tool steels are suited for use in the shaping of other materials.General Machining Guide for Molybdenum and Nickel …2016 7 25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;grade tools of the design normally used for cast iron.Where production quantities make it desirable to use high speed steel,shaping is preferred to milling,as sharper tools with a generous positive rake last longer and are easier to regrind.Face milling is effective for machining plane surfaces on molybdenum parts.
