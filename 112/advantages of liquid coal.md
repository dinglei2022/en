DCL is termed direct because the coal is transformed into liquid without first being gasified to form syngas (which can then in turn be transformed into liquid products).The latter twostep approach,i.e.the coal to syngas to liquids route is termed indirect coal liquefaction (ICL).Therefore,the DCL process is,in principle,the simpler andClassification of Fuels: Solid,Liquid and Gaseous Fuels,Liquid Fuels: Liquid fuels are much commonly employed in internal combustion engin They are also used for steam releasing purpos Some of the advantages of liquid fuels are: (i) Higher calorific value (ii) Economy in space (iii) Easy control of consumption (iv) Cleanliness (v) Economy in staff (vi) Elimination of wear and tear of grate bars

## What are the advantages of coal compared to other fossil fuels
First,the price of coal has remained relatively stable in recent years in comparison to the costs of competing fuels.Second,present day technology permits the burning of coal in a much cleaner fashion than in the past.Third,and also very important,is the ready availability of coal: it represents more than four fifths of&nbsp;.Pros & Cons Of Coal Energy EncyclopediaA combustible,sedimentary rock,coal is one of the main sources of energy production around the world Coal energy is generated when the fossil fuel is burned to generate heat and produce steam,which spins turbine generators that produce electricity Along with the steam engine,coal energy helped stimulate and sustain the Industrial Revolution

## environmental benefits netldoegov
Many of the technologies developed for conversion of coal to transportation fuels can also be leveraged for the conversion of biomass derived feedstocks,either independently or in conjunction with coal,which has particular advantages in reduction of life cycle CO 2 emissionsAdvantages & Disadvantages of Coal Gasification SciencingYou can learn about the disadvantages and advantages of coal by learning about how coal gasification emerged throughout history Understanding the coal gasification process as one that's multidimensional and composed of positives and negatives can let you make better decisions about using coal

## Coal to liquids: Can fuel made from coal replace gasoline?
Coal based fuels are formed from coal gasification (creating synthetic gas from coal) followed by a series of steps to remove pollutants,synthesize the fuels and then separate out the liquids in a process known as Fischer Tropsch CTL fuels have,advantages of liquid coal supremewheelscozaAdvantages of Coal To Liqu (CTL) Fuels • CTL Improves national and CoaltoLiquid Fuel Production Could Offer Major National Benefits Dec 10,2008 The federal government can spark the creation of a commercially competitive coaltoliquids industry by fostering early development of plants that would produce transportation fuels from coal

## The Advantages & Disadvantages of Fossil Fuels Inspire,
Jun 30,2020&#0183;&#32;The burning of coal is thought to contribute 44% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions Around the world,petrol (gasoline) alone is said to be responsible for a third of the carbon emissions Though cleaner than both coal and crude oil,natural gas is responsible for around 20% of our carbon emissionsCoal Derived Liquid Fuel Using Coal to Produce Ultra Clean.8 Feb 2008.One of the major advantage of using coal derived liquid fuel is that it can be used by today&#39;s gasoline and diesel powered vehicles and it is also compatible with petroleum distribution infrastructures and no new or modification of existing infrastructures such as storage tanks and pipelines are required.

## Coal liquids as refinery feedstock digitalrefining
A loion close to the refinery also provides advantages of nearby industrial partners such as a hydrogen pipeline,skilled maintenance and repair shops.KBC did not choose a loion for the coal upgrader.Instead,the coal price was freight onboard (FOB) to the upgrader,and the coal liquids were FOB to the refinery.
