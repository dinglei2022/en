Recovering zinc from zinc bearing ore or concentrate (1) in an electrolic cell (3) which includes a hode (5) containing hode compartment (16) and an anode (4) containing anode compartment (2).The hode and anode compartments are defined by interposing between such compartments an ionselective membrane (6) capable of preventing migration of ionic copper from anode compartment (2)Process Intensifiion of Zinc Oxide Leaching Processleaching of zinc oxide ore using sulphuric acid for the improvement of zinc recovery.The factors that were investigated in this study were agitation speed,acid concentration and the feeding mechanism of reactants into the reactor (batch and semibatch processes).Process Intensifiion of Zinc Oxide Leaching Process Using Sulphuric Acid
