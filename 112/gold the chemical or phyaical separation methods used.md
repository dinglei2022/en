## Natural Sciences Grade 9 mstworkbooks
The methods mentioned so far are all physical separation methods.Sometimes they are sufficient to separate minerals for use,like coal or iron ore.But more often the element that we are looking for is found as a chemical compound,and so will have to be separated by further chemical reactions.For example,copper in Cu 2 S or aluminium in AlPhysical method to extract metal from their ores byMining of Gold: 1) Placer mining Extracting of gold involving the use of water or dredging 2) Panning It is a method of getting gold through separating gold from other materials,by using wide,shallow pans filled with sand and gravel that may contain gold 3) Slucing Using a man.Prezi.
