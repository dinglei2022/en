Yellow arsenic is a waxy solid that converts into gray arsenic after exposure to light at room temperature.Brittle gray arsenic is the most stable form of the element.The element name comes from the ancient Persian word Zarnikh,which means &quotyellow orpiment.&quot Orpiment is arsenic trisulfide,a mineral that resembles gold.A review of copper arsenic mineral removal from copperMineral systems of copper sulphides and copper arsenic sulphides were tested,including a 1:1 mix of tennantite and chalcopyrite.The copper minerals could be separated from the copper arsenic minerals due to more collector adsorption and less oxide hydroxide species on the surface of the copper only minerals.

Arsenic is an elusive element,with a mysterious ability to change color,behavior,reactivity,and toxicity.For example,two arsenic sulfide minerals,redcolored realgar (As 4S 4) and bright yellow orpiment (As 2S 3),were described by the ancient Greeks,but they considered them to be two entirely different substances (Irgolic 1992).Arsenic in Copper ConcentrateIn a certain case study of "high" Arsenic in Copper Concentrate (almost 0.5% As) produced by flotation,and where the Cu Conc is mostly chalcopyrite and therefore the main form of copper the content of secondary copper minerals was variable.
