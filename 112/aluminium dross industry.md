## Aluminum Dross Processing :: Total Materia Article
Aluminum dross,a byproduct of the aluminum melting process,is a mixture of aluminum,its oxides,the oxides of alloying elements and less frequently halogenides,carbides and nitrides.Dross has some good benefits,especially considering tension strength and depending on further conditioning steps can be very useful further on.Aluminium dross recycling WikipediaDross recycling is different.Aluminium dross recycling is a completely different process to strictly aluminium recycling.Aluminium recycling is where pure aluminium metal products (previously used in another form) are remelted into aluminium ingots and then reused to new aluminium products.
