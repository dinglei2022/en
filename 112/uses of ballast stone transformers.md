If you leave the secondary open,it presents the primary inductance,too high to be of any use as a ballast This is what you'd get if you removed the secondary from the MOT If you take an ideal transformer and short one winding,then the other winding will also be effectively 'shorted',as the leakage inductance is very lowReplacement ballasts for Ottlite Quilting BoardAug 15,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32The wire stripper and wire nuts were just used to connect the wires.There is nothing special about an Ott ballast,it is the bulb color that sets them apart from other lamps.As for Ott selling replacement ballasts the website says that they now offer replacement parts but they didn't have them in stock for this light.
