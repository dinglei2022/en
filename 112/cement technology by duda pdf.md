Reactive powder concrete is extremely workable,durable and yields ultrahigh strengths without using coarse aggregates.Reaching compressive strengths of 30,000 pounds per square inch (psi),this newage concrete also has tensile strength with the inclusion of steel and synthetic fibers.Read more on reactive powder concrete.Concrete Slump Test for Workability Procedure and ResultsConcrete slump test or slump cone test is to determine the workability or consistency of concrete mix prepared at the laboratory or the construction site during the progress of the work.Concrete slump test is carried out from batch to batch to check the uniform quality of concrete during
