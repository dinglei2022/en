## The Mineralogy of Lithium Mindat
Most widespread minerals containing Lithium This list of minerals containing Lithium is built from the mindat locality database.This is based on the number of localities entered for mineral species and is therefore slanted towards minerals interesting to collectors with less coverage of common rockformingminerals so it does not give an undistorted distribution of Lithium mineral species.Nevada Mining Districts Files nbmg.unr.eduThe current mining district naming convention used in this index is based on Report 47.See Map of Mining Districts in Nevada,dated 1946,for a more historical reference on Nevada mining district loions.Over the last several years NBMG has undertaken the digital conversion of these paper documents into scanned images.
