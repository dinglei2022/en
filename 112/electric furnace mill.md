## To produce steel,facilities use one of two processes: the
To produce steel,facilities use one of two processes: the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) or the electric arc furnace (EAF).Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) The basic oxygen furnace is the process in which a mixture of scrap (25 to 30 percent) and hot metal (75 to 70 percent) from the blast furnace is exposed to oxygen blown at a high velocity into theElectric Arc Furnace Design Operation and Working PrincipleThe Second World War saw a steep increase in the use of these furnaces leading to the modern Electric Arc Furnace design operation and working principles.These improvements to the processing of scrap steel comprised of larger more efficient and higher capacity furnaces; a 100T furnace would process the scrap in about an hour,using a transformer of 60MVA capacity.
