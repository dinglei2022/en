An estimated 90% to 98% of the cadmium present in zinc ores is recovered in the mining and beneficiating stages of the extraction process.Figure 1 shows a schematic flow of mining and beneficiating a typical leadzinc ore.Figure 1.Schematic flowchart of mining and beneficiating a typical leadzinc ore Smelting and refiningQuantitative assessment of cadmium emission from zincIn Hezhang,zinc ores are divided into two major egories,one is sulfide ore as sphalerite (ZnS) and the other is oxide ore mainly as calamine (ZnCO 3) (detail description of the smelting processes see our previous paper Feng et al.2004).Cd emissions from Zn smelting using sulfide ores come from two kinds of sources.

## Zinc smelting Wikipedia
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals,e.g.iron,because in contrast,zinc has a low boiling point.Facility Introduction : Shisaka Smelting Co.Ltd.AboutThe Shisaka Smelting Co.Ltd.is loed on Yanoshima island.In the Shisaka Smelting Co.Ltd.the recycling business of recovering zinc contained in steelmaking dust is performed using refining technologies,while placing first priority on the protection of the natural environment.

## A Brief Summary of Zinc Oxide Processing Methods
A Brief Summary of Zinc Oxide Processing Methods Available for the Bongar&#225 Deposit Introduction Bongar&#225 oxide deposit is a typical calamine type deposit containing several zinc minerals: smithsonite,hydrozincite and hemimorphite.A large number of similar deposits were exploited from the beginning of the 19th century.TheHow zinc is made material,used,parts,componentsZinc ore is sometimes mined in conjunction with silver or lead ores.In addition to the ore itself,oil and sulfuric acid are required for the breakdown of the ores and electricity,coke,or natural gas are needed to provide the heat energy for smelting.Froth flotation

## Lead Essential Chemical Industry
The rock particles sink and the lead and zinc ores are skimmed off.Then the lead ore is separated from the zinc ore.A chemical called a depressant is added which is soluble in water (for example,zinc sulfate) and the zinc ore sinks and the lead ore is skimmed off.Outotec Direct Zinc Melting Process OutotecThe Outotec&#174 Direct Zinc Smelting (DZS) process provides a means for the direct pyrometallurgical treatment of zinc sulphide concentrates to produce a highpurity,oxide fume and low zinc

Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.The most common zinc concentrate processed is zinc sulfide,[1] which is obtained by concentrating sphalerite using the froth flotation method.Secondary (recycled) zinc material,such as zinc oxide,is also processed with the zinc sulfide.[2(R0010) American Zinc,Lead and Smelting CompanyR American Zinc,Lead and Smelting Company.010 Records,19011965.ranked second in zinc ore production and third in smelting capacity.By that time 107 Zinc Oxide 1908 1919 10.108 Hockaday Tract 1904 1915 10 (R0010) American Zinc,Lead and Smelting Company Records
