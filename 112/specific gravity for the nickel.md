## THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY TEST FOR COPPER,BRONZE,AND BRASS
In order to help me think through the specific gravity test,I made the above chart,which may be of interest to others.There are two solid lines on the chart that show pure bronze (CuSn) and brass (CuZn) alloys specific gravities (vertical axis) as a function of copper percentage (horizontal axis).Nickel Element Facts and Properties thoughtcoProperties: The melting point of nickel is 1453&#176C,the boiling point is 2732&#176C,specific gravity is 8.902 (25&#176C),with a valence of 0,1,2,or 3.Nickel is a silvery white metal that takes a high polish.Nickel is hard,ductile,malleable,and ferromagnetic.It is a fair conductor of heat and electricity.
