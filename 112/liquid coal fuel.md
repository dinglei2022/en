## Coal and Coal Biomass to Liquids
Turning coal into liquid fuels like gasoline,diesel and jet fuel,with biomass to reduce carbon dioxide emissions,is the main goal of the Coal and Coal Biomass to Liquids program.The program also aims to reduce the cost of these low emission fuels,and will take advantage of carbon capture and sequestration technologies to further reduce.Liquid Fuels Production from Coal &amp Gas IEAETSAPtransport fuels similar to diesel and gasoline,and other liquid chemical products such as methanol and dimethylether (DME).Liquid fuels from coal may be produced using two different approaches,i.e.direct and indirect coal liquefaction (DCL and ICL),which are at a different stage of development.In both DCL and ICL,the challenge is to

## Coal to Liquids (CTL) Ground Truth Trekking
The rising costs of fuel,combined with the fact that the U.S.has larger reserves of coal than it does oil,have prompted an upsurge of interest in the possibility of generating liquid fuels (such as gasoline and diesel) from coal in a process referred to as "coal to liquids (CTL)".Liquid Coal As a Transportation Fuel Energy CentralSolid coal was one of the early transportation fuels to be used in self powered ships,in the railway industry as well as in some early steam powered road transport vehicles.
