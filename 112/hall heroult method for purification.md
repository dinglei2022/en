 · This short flash animation looks in considerable depth at the extraction of alumina from bauxite and the subsequent extraction of aluminium by electrolysis in the Hall Heroult Cell.Aluminum Production the Hall Héroult Process."On Feb.23,1883,exactly three years before Hall made his first aluminum,Charles S.Bradley filed a patent application which claimed broadly the idea of fusing ´ores´ by the electric arc and then passing a current through the ore to decompose it and maintain it in the fused condition.Hall claimed a method "of baking carbon articles.

## Bayer process Wikipedia
In the Bayer process.a method by which aluminium hydroxide precipitates: 2 NaAlO 2 + CO 2 → 2 Al(OH) 3 + Na 2 CO 3 + H 2 O.But later,this gave way to seeding the supersaturated solution with high purity aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH) 3) crystal,which eliminated the need for cooling the liquid and was more economically feasible: 2 H 2 O.Conversion of Bauxite Ore to Aluminum MetalBauxite Ore Processing: Aluminum in the metal form is very difficult to obtain by using some of the traditional chemical methods involving carbon HallHeroult

## Hall Héroult process Wikipedia
The Hall Héroult process is the major industrial process for smelting aluminium.It involves dissolving aluminium oxide (alumina) (obtained most often from bauxite,aluminium 's chief ore,through the Bayer process ) in molten cryolite,and electrolysing the molten salt bath,typically in a purpose built cell.Hall Process Production and Commercialization …Aluminum was a semiprecious metal before Hall’s discovery of this economical method to release it from its ore.His invention,which made this light.
