The first step in minerals beneficiation of an ore is normally crushing which has been defined “as the operations required to reduce run of mine ore to grinding feed size”.It would therefore follow that the first metallurgical testing should be conducted on run of mine ore but,due to its size,this would be rather impractical.However,there is little need to test large rocks because.(PDF) An experimental investigation on rock crushabilityare obtained between several rock properties and crushability test results.It can have become an important issue in mining operations and the manufacture of industrial crusher equipment.
