## CA1289780C Grain refining metals Google Patents
ABSTRACT OF THE INVENTION Grain Refining Metals The invention provides a grain refinement method for copperbased metals,which method can be applied to a range of different types of such metals.In accordance with the method,one prepares a melt of the copperbased metal to be grain refined which is deficient in at least one of the following components: (a) zirconium (b) at least one ofCopper Smelting IFCrefining.In fire refining,molten blister copper is placed in a firerefining furnace,a flux may be added,and air is blown through the molten mixture to remove residual sulfur.Air blowing results in residual oxygen,which is removed by the addition of natural gas,propane,ammonia,or wood.The firerefined copper is cast into an
