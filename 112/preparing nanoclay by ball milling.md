19 Feb 2009.Abstract.The preparation of exfoliated polymer nanocomposites (PNC) in nonpolar system is still preoccupying researchers in the domain.The ball milling coupled with melt compounding was used for the preparation of polypropylene montmorillonite PNC to evaluate the potential of ball milling in the&nbsp;.How to make nanoclay? Any suggestion to synthesize it?Finally,the resulting material was ground using SFM 1 Desk Top Planetary Ball Miller (MTI) for 3 hours,in order to obtain a nanoscale powder.The organo nanoclay product was stored in bottle.

## Wood modifications for valued added applications using.
For the samples impregnated with the hydrophobic nanoclay (either ball mill treated or untreated) and MUF,similar weight gains (around 70%) can be obtained.For the wood impregnated with hydrophilic nanofiller NF3 MUF,lower weight gains are typical,for example,55.3% for the unmilled and 64.9% for the ball milled wood (in both cases nanoclay.Fabrication and characterization of nanoclay composites using.2.1.4.Synthesize of clay nanopowder.The nanopowder form of the clay was prepared using RETSCH Planetary Ball Mills Type PM 400.The clay sample was milled using the ball mill at a speed of 150 rpm for 8 h [24].
