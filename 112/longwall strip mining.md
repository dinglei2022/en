## PA Mining History
The major types of underground mining conducted in Pennsylvania's bituminous coalfields are roomandpillar mining,roomandpillar with retreat mining,and longwall mining.Roomandpillar mining involves driving tunnellike openings to divide the coal seam into rectangular or square blocks.Longwall mining SourceWatchLongwall mining is a form of underground coal mining where a long wall of coal is mined in a single slice (typically 12 m thick).The longwall &quotpanel&quot (the block of coal that is being mined) is typically 34 km long and 250400 m wide.Longwall mining produced 176 million tons of coal in 2007,about 15 percent of total U.S.production.
