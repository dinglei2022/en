## Processing The Phosphate Risk
In Florida,after the phosphate rock is extracted,the ore is dumped into a pit at.At the processing plant,the slurry mixture goes through a two step process to.Perfectal Ore Preparation PlantAn Ore Preparation Plant (OPP) consists of a dry side and a wet side.The mined oil sands ore is crushed on the dry side and transferred by conveyors to the slurry preparation area on the wet side,where it is mixed with hot water and caustic and fed to the Hydrotransport System.

## Coal preparation plant Wikipedia
A coal preparation plant (CPP also known as a coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP),coal handling plant,prep plant,tipple or wash plant) is a facility that washes coal of soil and rock,crushes it into graded sized chunks (sorting),stockpiles grades preparing it for transport to market,and more often than not,also loads coal into rail cars,barges,or ships.Iron Ore Mineral TechnologiesIron Ore Resourc Iron Ore Giving You Confidence With an unparalleled depth of knowledge in fine minerals the world’s largest producers rely on us as their ‘go to’ partner to beneficiate Iron Ore fines for new and existing projects

## Heavy Media Separation Process
The Sink and Float separation process is part of what is also known as a Heavy Media Separation Process (HMS) and are commercial adaptations of the common laboratory procedure used for separating a mixture of two products having differentials in specific gravity by immersing the sample in a heavy liquid having a gravity intermediate to those of the products to be separatedCoal Washing,Magnetic Separation &amp ProcessingThe dense medium separation process used in most coal washing and magnetic separation plants requires a suspension of finely milled magnetite in water.Magnetite for coal washing must be of overall high purity and be devoid of contaminants,such as hematite,sulphides or other minerals.
