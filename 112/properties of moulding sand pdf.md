## Introduction to Foundry Sand American Foundry Society
Since sand grains do not naturally adhere to each other,binders must be introduced to cause the sand to stick together and hold its shape during the introduction of the molten metal into the mold and the cooling of the casting.Because casting quality is inherently linked to sand quality,many references to the properties of foundry sand canEffect of Some Polysaccharide Starch Extracts onEffect of Some Polysaccharide Starch Extracts on AbstractThis work investigatethe properties of foundry moulding sand using different polysaccharide d

## Properties of Moulding Sand in Casting Mechanical Booster
The sand with lack of refractoriness melts and gets fuse in the casting and spoils the quality of the cast metal.The refractoriness is the measure of sinter point of the sand not its melting point.This is all about the six properties of moulding sand.Every types of moulding sand used in the casting process must have these six properties.IfThe Properties of Moulding Sand with Halloysitecontinuous development of new moulding materials.Currently the most widely used molding material is quartz molding sand with bentonite binder.In Poland and abroad,numerous studies are conducted to improve its properties,which have a direct impact on the quality of the finished casting
