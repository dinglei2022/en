## What Is Rock Crushing?
Rock crushing is a process used in the construction,mining,and aggregate industry.As the name suggests,it involves breaking down rock into fine,small pieces.The process usually involves several major pieces of equipment.A loader loads the crusher with the large pieces of rock.The crusher cannot crush boulder sized stone.Crusher selection guide — Sandvik CrushologyA crusher is a major investment,so it&#39;s essential to select one with the potential to meet your needs into the future.Our crusher selection guide covers a few of the key points to consider before making a decision.
