## Australian Bauxite The Australian Aluminium Council
There are currently five bauxite mines in Australia providing feedstock for the seven alumina refineries,which in turn supply alumina to the six Australian aluminium smelters and the export market.Australia is the largest producer of bauxite in the world,with 74.9 million tonnes produced in 2011.The five Australian bauxite mines are:Boddington bauxite mine Wood MackenzieThe Boddington mine is operated by Worsley Alumina and is among the largest bauxite mines in the world.Although the alumina content of the bauxite is comparatively low,Boddington bauxite provides a competitive material because of its low reactive silica content,low mining costs and conveyor transport system to the captive Worsley alumina refinery.
