Nov 15,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32Does anyone have a formula for calculating,or a chart for referencing Chip Load Feed per Tooth when cutting mild steel? Ideally for a range of end mill HSS cutter diameters.I am trying to calculate my estimated feed rate (IPM) using RPM x Chip load x # of flutes.CNC Routing Basics: Toolpaths and Feeds 'n Speeds Make:Mar 21,2014&nbsp&#0183&#32Where chipload is the amount of material cut per tooth (feed per tooth).Feed rate is the surface speed of the cutting tool in inches per min,spindle speed is the rotational speed of the cutting tool in revolutions per min,number of flutes and cutter diameter are determined by your tool.In this case they are &#188 inch and 2 flutes.
