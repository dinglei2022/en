## ATSDR Public Health Statement: Tungsten
Jan 21,2015&nbsp&#0183&#32Elemental tungsten,like elemental copper or gold,is a metal.Its color can range from tin white (for the pure metal) to steel gray (for metal that has impurities in it).Tungsten can be used as a pure metal or mixed with other metals to make alloys.Tungsten alloys tend to be strong and flexible,resist wear,and conduct electricity well.Tungsten Hexafluoride: The densest known gas gasworldTungsten hexafluoride is produced by the exothermic reaction of fluorine gas with tungsten powder.The gaseous product is condensed and separated by distillation from WOF4,a common impurity.In a variation on the direct fluorination,the metal is placed in a heated reactor,slightly pressurized to 1.2 to 2.0 psi,with a constant flow of WF6
