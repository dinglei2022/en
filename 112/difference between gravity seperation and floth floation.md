## Introduction to Mineral Processing cpchem
Frothers are liquids that produce the froth or foam on which the flotation process depends.The froth resembles soap suds and provides the physical separation between the mineral(s) floated and the pulp containing the waste.The froth must be strong enough to support the weight of the mineral floated and yet not be tenacious and nonflowing.difference between flotation and grinderdifference between flotation and grinder.The process of froth flotation entails crushing and grinding the ore to a fine size.provides the physical separation between the mineral(s) floated and the pulp containing the waste.Many different chemicals are used as collectors,such as:.
