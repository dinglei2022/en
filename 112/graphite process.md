## Carbon and Graphite production & further processing
The final step in graphite manufacture is a conversion of baked carbon to graphite.The final step in the production of graphite is the graphitisation process.Graphite 101 Focus GraphiteGraphite is the only nonmetal element that is a good conductor of electricity and heat.Its softness and streak make graphite useful in making lead for pencils.Crystals are uncommon,but when they occur,they are found as rough,sixsided (hexagonal) flakes.It breaks into minute,flexible flakes that easily slide over one another.

## Battery Minerals
Spherical graphite is a crucial ingredient to the efficient operation of lithium ion batteries (LiB).Spherical graphite is the key component of the anode of a LiB which without,the LiB would not function.Historically SPG has been derived from synthetic graphite,a significantly more costly option when compared against natural flake graphiteNuclear graphite WikipediaGraphite is an important material for the construction of both historical and modern nuclear reactors,due to its extreme purity and its ability to withstand extremely high temperatur Graphite has also recently been used in nuclear fusion reactors as well,such as the Wendelstein 7 X

## Graphite Processing Great Lakes Graphite
Micronized Flake Graphite Starting in 2016,Great Lakes Graphite has been working with a US based company in Pennsylvania to process orders for micronized.What is Graphitization? Definition from CorrosionpediaCompacted graphite iron Secondary graphitization is graphite formation that occurs by the transformation of metastable metallic carbides following solidifiion.A common process is when elevated temperatures result in microstructure deterioration,such as the decomposition of pearlite into the equilibrium structure of iron and graphite.
