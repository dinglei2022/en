## Mechanochemistry paves the way to higher quality.
Mechanochemistry is a rapidly developing field of science dealing with chemical reactions occurring directly between solid phase compounds upon activation by mechanical force.Chemists Get Back To The Grind With Mechanochemistry.Grinding a compound to create a new one dates back to at least 315 B.C.That’s when Aristotle’s student Theophrastus of Eresus wrote about the reduction of.

## Mechanochemistry and Its Application in Mineral Processing.
Mechanochemistry is to study the chemical and physicochemical changes of substances that occur under the action of mechanical force.In ultrafine grinding,minerals exhibit remarkable changes in crystal structure and activity and are in a highly efficient unstable.
