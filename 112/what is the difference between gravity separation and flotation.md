## Gravity Separation an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Gravity separation relies on the differences in density of minerals to provide efficient separation.Smallscale batch tests: These tests are frequently conducted as a part of the recovery flowsheet for flotation or cyanidation recovery tests using 500 1000 g samples ground to final product size for the recovery process in&nbspSTUDY ON GRAVITY SEPARATION AND FLOTATION.87%,and in flotation of the gravity separation tailings,the lead sulphide flotation produces a concentrate assaying 61.52 Pb with a lead recovery of 4.
