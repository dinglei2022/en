UK calcium carbonates are a nationally significant source of raw materials.Commercial calcium carbonate grades,in the form of powders,granules and slurries,are produced in 2 ways: through the extraction and processing of natural ores or synthetically through chemical precipitation.NRG Texas Power LLC,Limestone Station US EPA ARCHIVEsurface impoundments that receives FGD liquids and sludge.Flue gases from the precipitator are routed to the FGD unit,where the gases are exposed to a limestone slurry.The slurry reacts with sulfur compounds,which binds them into solution,producing FGD sludge.The emergency pond is used to store FGD sludge during emergency conditions.
