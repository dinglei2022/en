## Outotec addresses carbon losses in CIP,CIL gold circuits.
Outotec addresses carbon losses in CIP,CIL gold circuits Posted by Daniel Gleeson on 18th March 2020 Outotec has released a fully automated in situ measurement system that,it says,can minimise gold solution losses in carbon in pulp (CIP) and carbon in leach (CIL) circuits.Gold CIP Processing,Gold CIP Plant,Gold CIP Production.Gold CIP Production Line.Process Introduction.CIP (Carbon in pulp) process is a high efficient method to leaching and recovering gold from gold ore,The most different from CIL process is in CIP process,gold leaching and adsorption are separated,first leaching,and then adsorption.
