## A LoadInteractive Model for Predicting the Performance of
Autogenous and SemiAutogenous Mills† Abstract The Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) has been involved in the study and modelling of industrial autogenous (AG) and semiautogenous (SAG) mills for over 25 years.Recent research at the JKMRC has developed a new AG SAG mill model which is based on charge dynamics.An EKF observer to estimate semiautogenous grinding201722&ensp&#0183&enspAbstract A nonlinear observer model of a semiautogenous grinding mill is developed.The observer model distinguishes between the volumetric holdup of water,solids,and the grinding media in the mill.Solids refer to all ore small enough to discharge through the enddischarge grate,and grinding media refers to the rocks and steel balls.
