## Construction of DC Machine (Generator &amp; Motor)
The dc generators and dc motors have the same general construction.In fact,when the machine is being assembled,the workmen usually do not know whether it is a dc generator or motor.Any dc generator can be run as a dc motor and vice versa.Read: Working of DC MotorInstitute Technology DC” MIT OpenCourseWareThis sort of machine is simple in construction.Note that the operating magnetic ﬂux density in.in rather direct analogy the what is done in DC machines.
