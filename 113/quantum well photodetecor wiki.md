## OSA Interband infrared photodetectors based on HgTe,
We calculate the characteristics of interband HgTe CdHgTe quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) Due to a small probability of the electron capture into the QWs,the interband HgTe CdHgTe QWIPs can exhibit very high photoconductive gain Our analysis demonstrates the significant potential advantages of these devices compared to the conventional CdHgTe photodetectors and the.AlGaAs GaAs Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors IntechOpenIn this article,we present an overview of a focal plane array (FPA) with 640 × 512 pixels based on the AlGaAs quantum well infrared photodetector (QWIP) The physical principles of the QWIP operation and their parameters for the spectral range of 8 10 μm have been discussed The technology of the manufacturing FPA based on the QWIP structures with the pixels 384 × 288 and 640 × 512 has.

## Quantum well infrared photodetector Infogalactic: the,
A Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector (QWIP) is an infrared photodetector,which uses electronic intersubband transitions in quantum wells to absorb photons The basic elements of a QWIP are quantum wells,which are separated by barriersThe quantum wells are designed to have one confined state inside the well and a first excited state which aligns with the top of the barrierQuantum well infrared photodetector WikipediaA quantum well laser is a laser diode in which the active region of the device is so narrow that quantum confinement occurs Laser diodes are formed in compound semiconductor materials that (quite unlike silicon) are able to emit light efficientlyThe wavelength of the light emitted by a quantum well laser is determined by the width of the active region rather than just the bandgap of the.
