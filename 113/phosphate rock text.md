## Improving the short term efficiency of rock phosphate.
The use of reactive rock phosphate (RP) in acidic soils as a phosphate (P) source for pastures and crops presents attractive economic advantages with respect to soluble phosphate.However,some studies have demonstrated that the short term (1 year) efficiency of RP,compared with that of water soluble P,is relatively poor.This fact penalizes not only the yield and quality of the earlier.Full text of "Phosphate rocks of South Carolina and the.Full text of "Phosphate rocks of South Carolina and the "great Carolina marl bed".Since the discovery of the Phosphate rock Basins,a number of companies have been organized for Min ing,Grinding,and Manufacturing the raw material into Fertilizers or Superphosphates,by subjecting the finely pulverized rock to the action of Sulphuric.
