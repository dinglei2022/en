High density polyethylene for instance should be heated to a range of 130&#176;C — 135&#176;C for forming Polyethylenes can be readily welded with hot air However,since oxygen at high temperatures has a tendency to degrade these materials,inert gas such as nitrogen should be used to weld this materialHigh Density Polyethylene Safety Containers and BottlesHigh Density Polyethylene (HDPE) plastic lab bottles and carboys offer good strength and chemical resistance and can withstand higher temperatures than LDPE.
