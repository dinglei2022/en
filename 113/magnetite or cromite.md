## Chromite Sibelco
Chromite is an iron chromium oxide commonly associated with olivine,magnetite,serpentine,and corundum As a major source of metal chromium,the extracted chromium from chromite is used in chrome plating and alloying for production of corrosion resistant superalloys,nichrome and,Decoupling of arsenic and iron release from ferrihydrite.In this paper,we investigate the release of arsenic sorbed on or co precipitate.2LFh,Vivianite,Bobierrite 2LFh,Vivianite 2LFh 2LFh 1 From ho.

Aug 30,2012&#0183;&#32;Chromite was also used as erodent because it has been considered by other authors to be a good replacement for magnetite,However,unexpected erosion behaviours were observed when using this erodent,which will be later shown to be a consequence of the much higher hardness of chromite in comparison to magnetite
