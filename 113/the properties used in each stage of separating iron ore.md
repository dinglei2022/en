The amount of tailings generated is dependent on the ore grade,(proportion of valuable minerals in the ore) For example,if the cut off grade in the ore is 1 % Copper,99 percent of the total ore would be deposited as tailings Iron ores generally have higher grades than sulfide or gold ores,often going over 50 per cent or moreIron Ore 2017Wet beneficiation of iron ore fines less than 1 mm typically involve a desliming stage ahead of the fine gravity separation such as spirals.The desliming is achieved using a bank of cyclones.The ultrafines emerge from the overflow streams at relatively low pulp density,containing high proportions of low value slimes,and well liberated iron ore ultrafines.Clearly,this flow stream presents.
