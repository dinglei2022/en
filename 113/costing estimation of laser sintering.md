## A process for estimating minimum feature size in selective
Design methodology approach A framework is presented which uses an interpolation method and a statistical model to estimate the minimum size for a wide range of features from a set of iterative experiments.A process for estimating minimum feature size in selective laser sintering propose a means of estimating minimum feature sizes forSimulation of the Selective Laser Sintering ProcessABSTRACT An analytical ray tracing model is developed to simulate the energy absorption and penetration during the selective laser sintering (SLS) of metal powders.The model is applied to a FeCu powder mixture.It gives an evaluation of the energy absorption and penetration and an estimation of the sintering zone dimension.
