## Cadmium Drinking Water Contaminants,Facts Removal Methods
2.9 million lbs.of cadmium were produced in the US in 1986,and nearly twice that amount was imported in the same year.Cadmium occurs naturally in zinc,lead,copper and other ores which can serve as sources to ground and surface waters,especially when in contact with soft,acidic waters.Major industrial releases ofStructural and functional modifications of the major light harvesting.Plant Cell Physiol.2010 Aug;51(8):1330 40.doi: 10.1093 pcp pcq093.Epub 2010 Jul 13.Structural and functional modifications of the major light harvesting complex II in cadmium or copper treated Secale cereale.Janik E(1),Maksymiec W,Mazur R,Garstka M,Gruszecki WI.Author information: (1)Department of Plant&nbsp;.

## Cadmium resources,reserves and productionMetalpedia
Cadmium's abundance in the Earth's crust is about 0.2 part per million (ppm).Greenockite (CdS),the only cadmium mineral of importance,is not found in any isolated deposits,but is nearly always associated with sphalerite (ZnS).Cadmium is usually produced as a byproduct in the recovery of primary zinc from zinc ores..antimony,bismuth,copper,cadmium and indium in ores.Determination of silver,antimony,bismuth,copper,cadmium and indium in ores,concentrates and related materials by atomic absorption spectrophotometry aft.
