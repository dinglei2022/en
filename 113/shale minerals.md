## Cambrian burgess shale animals replicated in clay minerals
Although the evolutionary importance of the Burgess Shale is universally acknowledged,there is disagreement on the mode of preservation of the fossils after.Shale Wikipedia2019729&ensp&#0183&enspShale is a finegrained,clastic sedimentary rock,composed of mud that is a mix of flakes of clay minerals and tiny fragments (siltsized particles) of other minerals,especially quartz and calcite.[1] Shale is characterized by breaks along thin laminae or parallel layering or bedding less than one centimeter in thickness,called fissility.[1

## Surfactant inhibition mechanisms of carbonate mineral,
Shales are complex assemblages of fine mineral fragments and organic matter of varying reactivity,and in many cases are dominated by highly reactive carbonate minerals (eg,Eagle Ford shale >60% calcite,,Wolfcamp and Marcellus shales >80% calcite + dolomite) Shales are exposed to injected fluids during hydraulic fracturing and.Marcellus Shale Play Energy Information Administration201836&ensp&#0183&enspof the major tight oil and shale gas plays for the continental United States.This document outlines updated information and maps for the Marcellus play of the Appalachian basin.The geologic features characterized and updated since the 2011 Marcellus shale play map include contoured elevation of
