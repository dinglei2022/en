## Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses.
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis.The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 50% of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.BALL MILLS orbismachinery2018827&ensp&#0183&enspBALL MILLS.Grinding of materials in a tumbling mill with the presence of metallic balls or other media dates to the late 1800's.The basic construction of a ball mill is a cylindrical container with journals at its axis.The cylinder is filled with grinding media
