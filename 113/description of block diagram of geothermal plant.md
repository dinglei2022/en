## Energy Analysis of Thermal Power Plant IJSER
Energy Analysis of Thermal Power Plant Raviprakash kurkiya,Sharad chaudhary Abstract — Energy analysis helps designers to find ways to improve the performance of a system in a many way.Most of the conventional energy losses optimization method are iterative in nature and require the interpretation of the designer at each iteration.LNG Plant Overview MurmanshelfLNG plant block diagram End flash HHC Extraction CH4 N2 Fuel gas Power and Heat Gas conditioning (pre treatment) 10 •Acid Gas (CO2and H2S) removal −Acid gas causes corrosion,reduces heating value,and may freezeand create solids in cryogenic process −Typical requirements for LNG: Max 50 ppmv CO2,Max 4 ppmv H2S

## How a Geothermal Power Plant Works (Simple) Department
Geothermal power plants have much in common with traditional powergenerating stations.They use many of the same components,including turbines,generators,transformers,and other standard power generating equipment.While there are three types of geothermal power plants,this animation shows a generic plant.View text version of animation.Geothermal Binary Power Plants at Raft River,San Emidio,2 Power Plant Descriptions Each of the three binary plants may be represented in block diagram form as shown in Figure 1 Table 1 gives the details of the equipment used in each block The thermodynamic analysis is based on the geofluid characteristics and on blocks C and D in Figure 1 Table 1 Plant characteristics for blocks shown in Fig 1

## Nuclear power plant Wikipedia
A nuclear power plant is a thermal power station in which the heat source is a nuclear reactor.As is typical in al.HistorySystemsPeople in a nuclear power plantGeothermal Basics BasicsFigure 5: Flash Power Plant Diagram,Photo: Dixie Valley,NV,Flash Plant.In a geothermal dry steam power plant,steam alone is produced directly from the geothermal reservoir and is used to run the turbines that power the generator (Figure 6).Because there is no water,the steam separator used in a flash plant is not necessary.
