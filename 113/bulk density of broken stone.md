## Porosity and Bulk Density of Sedimentary Rocks
Gary (1898) listed the bulk density of numerous building stones,and the total porosity as determined by the grain density&#173; bulk density relation,but his specimens are usually not identified according to the geologic formation Moore (1904) determined the porosity of specimens of sedimentary rocks by saturating them with#57 Rock Crushed Concrete GravelshopAbout #57 Rock Crushed Concrete #57 Rock Crushed Concrete is a crushed concrete aggregate Sizes of #57 Stone range from 1 inch to 1 2 inch Recycled materials can contain metal and other debris Size Variation: Please allow for up to 10% larger or smaller pieces as well as up to 10% fine material within your product than what is described in.

## Bulking Swell of Excavated or Mined Materials
Bulking Swell Factors for Various Excavated Mined Materials The swell factor expressed in percentage is the amount of volume increase from bank volume (undisturbed,in place state) to loose volume (disturbed,excavated state) of the material due to voids (air pockets) added to the material after excavationChapter 18 Feed Milling Processes Food and Agriculture,Feeds of low bulk density are formed best in dies rotating at higher speeds 42 Influence of Feed Composition Additional factors known to influence pellet quality include bulk density of the soft feed,its texture,chemical composition (fat,fibre,carbohydrate,protein,and moisture) and prevailing ambient conditions of temperature and relative humidity
