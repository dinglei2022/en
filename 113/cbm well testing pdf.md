## Characteristics of the pressure and pressure derivative.
In order to verify and apply the results of this research,here we interpret the well testing of DS518# which is a CBM well in a CBM block of China by the model and the calculation method proposed in this paper.The pressure build up test of DS518# started on September 2nd,2017 and ended on …CBM well drilling and completionHydraulic fracture stimulations in cased and perforated CBM wells are very similar to those in conventional reservoirs,and there are many advantages to this completion type.By casing the well,interbedded strata can be placed behind pipe.
