## Dissolved air flotation Wikipedia
Dissolved air flotation (DAF) is a water treatment process that clarifies wastewaters (or other waters) by the removal of suspended matter such as oil or solids.The removal is achieved by dissolving air in the water or wastewater under pressure and then releasing the air at atmospheric pressure in a flotation tank basin.The released air formsFroth flotation WikipediaFroth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing,paper recycling and wastewater treatment industries.Historically this was first used in the mining industry,where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.
