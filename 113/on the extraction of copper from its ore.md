Copper processing is a complied process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called hodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the differentHow is copper obtained from its sulphide ore?

## Extraction Of Copper Mining,Concentration,Smelting
The percentage of copper in the actual ore is too low for direct extraction of copper to be viable.The concentration of ore is required and it is done by the Froth Flotation method.Concentration of Ore: The ore is crushed into a fine powder and a suspension is created in water.To this are added,Collectors and Froth Stabilizers.Copper Mining and Extraction Sulfide OresThis KS3 eduion resource looks at copper mining,extraction and pyroprocessing of sulfide ores.This KS3 eduion resource looks at copper mining,extraction and pyroprocessing of sulfide ores.About Copper.Copper can be extracted from its ore by: Underground: sinking a vertical shaft into the Earth to an appropriate depth and driving

## extraction of copper from their ore mirest.cz
Copper can be extracted from nonsulfide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulfuric acid to produce a very dilute copper(II) sulfate solution.Extraction of Aluminum,Copper,Zinc &amp Iron Video.Extraction of Copper.AN INTRODUCTION TO COPPER EXTRACTION20101221&ensp&#0183&enspThe copper extraction process begins at an open cut mine where Copper Ore is blasted and removed via Excavators and Tip Trucks.The ore is fed to a Crusher where it is broken down to a specified maximum size and passed through to a conveyor.When the crushed ore falls onto the conveyor it is transported to a Ball Mill to have its particle size

## How is copper extracted from its Sulphide ore ? Explain
In the extraction of copper from its Sulphide Ore,when ore is subjected to roasting some of it is oxidised to Cu 2 O which reacts with the remaining Cu 2 S to give copper metal.In this process,Cu 2 S behaves as reducing agent.2Cu 2 S+3O 2 +heat→2Cu 2 O(s)+2SO 2 (g).2Cu 2 O+Cu 2 S+heat→ 6Cu(s)+SO 2 (g).In electrolytic refining of copper,the impurities left behind at anode called
