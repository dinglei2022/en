## Iron ore pelletization ScienceDirect
Although iron ore concentrates are generally higher in iron grade and contain lower impurities,the finer size distribution of concentrates limits their usage in iron ore sintering.Therefore,pelletizing is needed to produce fired pellets from concentrates as burden materials forbentonite specifiion to pelletizing ironEffects of bentonite fiber formation in iron ore pelletization.Iron ore pelletization plants in the United States used approximately 612,000 metric tons of bentonite as a binder to produce iron ore concentrate pellets in 2000 (Virta,2001).It is a major cost item,with individual plants spending US$3 5 million annually for bentonite.
