## Mohs scale of mineral hardness Wikipedia
The Mohs scale of mineral hardness ( m oÊŠ z ) is a qualitative ordinal scale,from 1 to 10,characterizing scratch resistance of various minerals through the ability of harder material to scratch softer material The scale was created in 1822 by German geologist and mineralogist Friedrich Mohs; it is one of several definitions of hardness in materials science,some of which are more.The Quartzite Problem Revisited The Journal of,The proposed criteria of exceptional hardness,conchoidal fracture,and vitreous luster are readily evaluated with a hand lens and rock hammer and therefore accommodate the practical necessity of megascopic identification during field work

## Kyanite Hardness GemSelect
Kyanite exhibits a marked variation in hardness When it is cut parallel to its long axis,the hardness of kyanite can range from 4 to 45 on the Mohs scale,but when cut perpendicularly,its hardness can range from 6 to 7 in the same crystalQuartz vs Quartzite vs Granite Kitchen Countertops,Itâ€™s a mineral known formally as quartz arenite If you were to see it in its raw form,you could confuse it with white beach sand thatâ€™s mixed with specs of brown and pink,If youâ€™re looking for rock hard surfaces,quartzite has an edge because it scores 8 of 10 on the Mohs hardness scale used to rate gemstones and minerals In fact.
