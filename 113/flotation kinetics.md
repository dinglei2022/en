## Jameson cell Wikipedia
Jameson's research showed that the kinetics of flotation of fine particles was a strong function of the bubble diameter and that the way to improve recoveries was to use small bubbles in the order of 300 μm in diameter What was needed was a practical method of making such bubbles in large quantities,of the order of billions per second(PDF) First order flotation kinetics models and methods,To improve their versatility,many first order flotation kinetics models with distributions of flotation rate constants were redefined so that they could all be represented by the same set of.
