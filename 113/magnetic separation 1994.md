Magnetic separation is a process used to separate materials from those that are less or non&#173magnetic.All materials have a response when placed in a magnetic field,although with most,the effect is too slight to be detected.The few materials that are strongly affected (magnetised) by magnetic fields are known as "Ferromagnetics",those lesser (though noticeably) affected are known asAppliion of high temperature superconductors to highHigh Gradient Magnetic Separation (HGMS) is a powerful technique which can be used to separate widely dispersed contaminants from a host material,This technology can separate magnetic solids from other solids,liquids,or gases.As the name implies,HGMS uses large magnetic field gradients to separate ferromagnetic and paramagnetic particles.
