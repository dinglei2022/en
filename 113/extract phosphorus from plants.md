## Extraction methods in soil phosphorus characterisation,
In later half of 19th century,papers dealing with phosphorus (P) retention in soil and extraction of P from soils were already published (Kurtz,1953) Being an essential nutrient for plant growth,the estimation of plant available P has a long history According to Kurtz (1953),in the beginning of the 20th century the scientific community wasPhosphorus Removal and Recovery from Digestate …Phosphorus Removal and Recovery from Digestate after Biogas Production.By Hongjian Lin,Jing Gan,Aravindan Rajendran,Cristiano Eduardo Rodrigues Reis and Bo Hu.only 0.1% of the total P in soil is available to plants.Overall,phosphorus separation from animal manure and digestate is a critical step in the sustainable utilization of the.

## 'P' is for phosphate: Could urine solve a fertilizer.
Phosphorus is essential to plant growth,but there’s a looming shortage,which could leave global agriculture without the fertilizer needed to feed growing populations.Some scientists think,with some tweaks to our sanitation system,human urine could be mined for the necessary phosphorus.Device Mines Precious Phosphorus From Sewage ,Device Mines Precious Phosphorus From Sewage,Some struvite naturally precipitates out of the water in wastewater treatment plants,causing pipes to clog But to extract the mineral in amounts.
