## In situ Wikipedia
In situ leaching or in situ recovery refers to the mining technique of injecting water underground to dissolve ore and bringing the uranium impregnated water to the surface for extraction Petroleum production In situ refers to recovery techniques which apply heat or solvents to heavy crude oil or bitumen reservoirs beneath the earth's crustIn situ leaching of Crownpoint,New Mexico Ore VI The,Mobil has successfully recovered uranium by insitu leaching from a depth of 2000 feet in the Westwater Canyon Member of the Morrison Formation near Crownpoint,New Mexico This was the deepest in situ uranium leach successfully carried out in the United States,and the first in situ uranium leach.

## In situ leach
In situ leaching (ISL),also called in situ recovery (ISR) or solution mining,is a process of recovering minerals such as copper and uranium through boreholes drilled into the deposit The process initially involves drilling of holes into the ore deposit Explosive or hydraulic fracturing may be used to create open pathways in the deposit for solution to penetrateLeaching WikipediaTank leaching,a hydro metallurgical method of extracting valuable material from ore; In situ leaching,a process of recovering minerals such as copper and uranium through boreholes drilled into the deposit; Leaching (pedology),the loss of mineral and organic solutes due to percolation from soil
