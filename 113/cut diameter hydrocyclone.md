## Hydrocyclone Wikipedia
A hydrocyclone (often referred to by the shortened form cyclone) is a device to classify,separate or sort particles in a liquid suspension based on the ratio of their centripetal force to fluid resistance.This ratio is high for dense (where separation by density is required) and coarse (where separation by size is required) particles,and low for light and fine particles.(PDF) CFD modelling of hydrocyclone—prediction of cut sizeEffect of spigot diameter,i.e.10 and 20 mm and inlet water velocities (5.91 12.35 m s) on the water splits and particle classifiion in the hydrocyclone have been studied.The cut size of the hydrocyclone,operated at very low pulp density,has been

Mar 08,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32At a reasonable operating pressure of 124 kPa,the cut size on a 250 mm hydrocyclone is below 30 microns.When operating in this condition,the cyclone efficiency is almost 90%.Efficiency is defined as the mass percentage of product size in the hydrocyclone feed that reported to the overflow (product size defined at the 80% passing point ofAssessing the effects of the cone force J ratio on thesmall diameter hydrocyclone.The cut size and water split were used as the criterion for evaluating the performance of the hydrocyclone.Results from the tests showed that the cut size decreased with an increase in the cone force ratio.The cut size also appeared to decrease as the calculated locus of zero vertical velocity (LZVV) shifted inwards.

## The Effect of Inlet Velocity on the Separation Performance
Currently,the hydrocyclone is the main device for particle size classiﬁion [6 8].Two products,overﬂow and underﬂow,can be obtained via a single separation step in a conventional hydrocyclone.Particles with sizes smaller than the cut size fall into the overﬂow,and particles with sizes larger than the cut size fall into theCyclones Resource BookCYCLONES 5555 HydroCyclones A typical hydrocyclone consists of a conically shaped vessel,open at its apex (spigot),or underflow,joined to a cylindrical section,which has a tangential feed inlet.The top of the cylindrical section is closed with a plate through which passes an axially mounted overflow pipe.
