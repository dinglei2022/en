## 1.6 Concrete (Part II) NPTEL
1.6.1 Properties of Hardened Concrete (Part II) The properties that are discussed are as follows.1) Stress strain curves for concrete 2) Creep of concrete 3) Shrinkage of concrete Stress strain Curves for Concrete Curve under uniaxial compression The stress versus strain behaviour of concrete under uniaxial compression is initially linear.
