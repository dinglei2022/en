CopelandOct 20,2020&#0183;&#32;The compression strength of a material is its ability to withstand external forces that push on it When a column supports a load from above,it is under compressive stress On a molecular level,the consequence of that force is that the particles atoms and molecules in the material shorten Compression is a factor in all buildings,since loads.

Compressive strength does vary with temperature,hence this is one of the guiding principles in refractory selection ‘Creep’ tests have long been performed on refractory materials,with the tests applying pressure at elevated temperatures on refractory materials ‘Creep’ in this sense refers to the notion of expansion or contraction.High Temperature Axial Compression of Lithium2016625&ensp&#0183&enspHigh Temperature Axial Compression of Lithium Metatitanate Pebbles Daniel Papp,Tom Sketchley,Pattrick Calderoni,Alice Ying,UCLA CBBI13,Santa Barbara,CA,USA,Nov 30 Dec 2,2005.
