Mill scale is formed on the outer surfaces of plates,sheets or profiles when they are being produced by rolling red hot iron or steel billets in rolling or steel mills.Mill scale is composed of.Steel and Manufacturing Industry Solutions Water and.The scale pit is used to remove the larger scale and particulate,as well as to skim the oil from the water and is normally sized for 30 45 minutes of retention time.In some mills,this pit also receives wastewater from the hot roll and other miscellaneous processes throughout the mill.

## Mill scale
Mill scale,often shortened to just scale,is the flaky surface of hot rolled steel,consisting of the mixed iron oxides iron(II) oxide (FeO),iron(III) oxide (Fe 2 O 3),and iron(II,III) oxide (Fe 3 O 4,magnetite).Mill scale is formed on the outer surfaces of plates,sheets or profiles when they are being produced by rolling red hot iron or steel bEffect of processing parameters on scale formation during.The influence of processing parameters (slab thickness,water flow of interstand cooling and oil flow in roll gap lubrication system) on the thickness and composition of the tertiary scale formed during hot strip rolling,was st

## What exactly is Mill Scale and what is done about it
In a rolling mill where the steel will be stretched and squished the mill scale will first be removed mostly by water jets,or by sand blasting in some shops or by vibrating rolls in others and the mill scale will fall into a pit below the equipment where it will also be joined by rolling mill lubricants and bearing oils and water..scale coal fires using gasliquid foams in open pit mines.20151228 Novel approach for extinguishing large scale coal.the special stainless steel is used to.water supply situation in the open pit mine.
