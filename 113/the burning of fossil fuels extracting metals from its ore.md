## Human activities that affect the Earth and its environment
Each step in the process of extracting a metal like copper or processing iron into steel requires energy either electricity or heat.This essentially comes from burning fossil fuels.Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.This gas is a greenhouse gas and contributes to global warming.Extracting Metals 2 Science Makes SenseExtracting Metals 2 (by Electrolysis) Metals that are above carbon in the reactivity series have strong bonds within their compounds Therefore high amount of energy (electrical energy) is required when separating metals like aluminium from their compounds,making this,

## The Hidden Costs of Fossil Fuels Union of Concerned.
Depending on where fossil fuels are extracted and used,the resource itself may need to travel across long distances—but transporting fuel can generate its own pollution,and increase the potential for catastrophic accidents.Coal.In most cases,coal is transported from mines to power plants.In 2014,approximately 68 percent of the coal.Fossil Fuels: what are they,how are they formed and used?Fossil fuels are not a renewable energy resource because they take millions of years to form,and reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being made Once we’ve burnt them all,there isn’t any more,and our consumption of fossil fuels has nearly doubled every 20 years since 1900
