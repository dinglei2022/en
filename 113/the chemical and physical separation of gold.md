## Gold,Chemical Element uses,elements,examples,metal
Gold has been called the most beautiful of all chemical elements.Its beauty has made it desirable for use in jewelry,coins,and artwork for thousands of years.It was one of the first pure metals to be used by humans.Gold is one of the few elements that can affect politics and economics.Wars have been fought over access to gold.Physical and chemical methods of separation (Berg.Physical and chemical methods of separation (Berg,Eugene W.)Separation (TechnologyNot Availabledoi:10.1021 ed040p501.3Lockhart B.Rogers.
