## Mill (grinding)
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.hBall Mill LoadingBall Mill Loading Wet Milling.Ball Mill Loading (wet milling) When charging a ball mill,ceramic lined mill,pebble mill,jar mill or laboratory jar use on a jar rolling mill it is important to have the correct amount of media and correct amount of product.
