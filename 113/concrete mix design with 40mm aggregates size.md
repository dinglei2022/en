## EFFECTS OF AGGREGATE TYPE,SIZE,AND CONTENT ON,
The effects of aggregate type,size,and content on the behavior of normal and high strength concrete,and the relationships between compressive strength,flexural strength,and fracture energy are discussed The concrete mixtures incorporate either basalt or crushed limestone,aggregate sizes of 12 mm ('h in) or 19 mm (:Y in),anddifferences in concrete properties using 10mm to 20mm,Depending on the mix design,either can be used to make essentially any range of concrete strengths When you use a smaller aggregate,such as the 10mm as your nominal coarse aggregate size,the specific surface area of the total volume of coarse aggregate is much higher than for the 20mm aggregate

## Designing Concrete Mixtures Civil Engineering
Designing Concrete Mixtures There are three phases in the development of a concrete mixture: specifying,designing,and proportioning ACI Mix Design The most common method used in North America is that established by ACI Recommended Practice 2111 Any mix design procedure will provide a first approximation.Rules for Concrete with Recycled AggregatesGeneralised Mix Design Rules for Concrete with Recycled AggregatesA conceptual formulation for controlling the resulting mechanical properties of Recycled Agg.

## What should be the ratio of 20mm to 10mm size aggregates,
Aggregates make up some 60 80% of the concrete mix • Aggregates are divided into either ‘coarse’ or ‘fine’ categori Coarse aggregates are particulates that are greater than 475mm The usual range employed is between 95mm and 375mm in dia.Concrete Mix Design: Understanding Aggregate NPCAAggregate shape’s effect on concrete quality By Frank Bowen Editor’s Note: This is the second article in a year long series that explores the science of concrete to provide a better understanding of mix design The series will be collaboratively written by Paul Ramsburg,technical sales specialist at Sika Corp,and Frank Bowen,quality control manager at Piedmont Precast
