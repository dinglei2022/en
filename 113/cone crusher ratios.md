## Cone Crusher
Zong Xian Zhang in Rock Fracture and Blasting 2016Abstract Various types of rock fracture occur at different loading rates For example rock destruction by a boring machine a jaw or cone crusher and a grinding roll machine are within the extent of low loading rates often called quasistatic loading conditionCone CrusherThe breaking head gyrates inside an inverted truncated cone.These crushers are designed so that the head to depth ratio is larger than the standard gyratory crusher and the cone angles are much flatter and the slope of the mantle and the concaves are parallel to each other.

## Crusher Size Reduction Ratio Calculation Method
Crusher Size Reduction Ratio Calculation Method.Crusher size reduction ratio is the ratio of raw material particle size and particle size of crushing.Crusher size reduction ratio is the ratio of raw material particle size and paCone Crushers McLanahanCone Crusher Applications.A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio.A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio.Thus,with a 3⁄4” closed side setting,the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches.Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing.
