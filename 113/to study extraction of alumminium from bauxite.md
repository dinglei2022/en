## Environmental Impact Analysis of Primary Aluminium
Aluminium hydroxide is produced from bauxite ore,which was taken equal for all countries throughout the study.211 Dimos Paraskevas et al. Procedia CIRP 40 ( 2016 ) 209 &#226€" 213 (1) Figure 1: Process network used to calculate the environmental impact of primary aluminium production.The red boxes mark the country dependent variables.What Aluminum Extraction Really Does to the EnvironmentExtraction process Openpit mining (also known as surface,opencast or strip mining),in which large swaths of earth are excavated relatively close to the surface in order to remove valuable materials,enables workers to loe raw bauxite.
