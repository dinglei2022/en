## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles andhow to calculate mill critcal speedBall Mill Critical Speed A Ball Mill Critical Speed (actually ball,rod,AG or SAG) is the speed at which the centrifugal forces equal gravitational forces at the mill shell’s inside surface and no balls will fall from its position onto the shell.The imagery below helps.

## Ball Mills
For ball milling,there is an optimum speed where the centrifugal force at the top of the mill is just balanced by the force of gravity.This caused the balls to be lifted to the maximum height before they fall onto the balls below,thus imparting the most kinetic energy.In practice,the ball mill is run at just below this speed (70 80%).Gold Machine Ball Mill For Gold Medium SpeedWe have gold machine ball mill for gold medium speed,CNC Machinery 2943500 Kent USA CNC TW32MV Bed Mill with FANUC 3Axis 0MD Control New FAROGOLD 5Axis CNC Milling Machine for Rings Bangles Engraving Diamond Cutting Drilling Stone Setting Patented CNC Diamond Cutting Machine for Ball Chain NEW OMPAR CNC
