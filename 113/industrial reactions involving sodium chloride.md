## The Manufacture of Chlorine
However,chlorine also reacts with sodium hydroxide solution to produce a mixture of sodium chloride and sodium chlorate(I),also known as sodium hypochlorite; this mixture is commonly sold as bleach.In addition,when the desired products are chlorine and sodium hydroxide rather than bleach,chlorine and sodium hydroxide must also be kept apart.Solvay Process to Make Sodium CarbonateSodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3) is found naturally or is manufactured from natural salt i.e.sodium chloride (common salt).It has many uses but,one of the major notable applications is in making of glass.Soda ash is a key chemical for producing soap,paper making,baking soda production,and bleaching fabrics and paper.

## Water Adsorption and Reactions on Small Sodium …
25&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Energetics,structures,and reactions of water with small sodium chloride clusters,Na 4 Cl n,2 ≤ n ≤ 4,and of OH doped nonstoichiometric,Na 4 Cl 3 (OH),Na 4 Cl 2 (OH),and Na 4 Cl 2 (OH) 2,clusters,are investigated employing electronic structure calculations using the local spin density functional method with exchange correlation gradient corrections in conjunction with norm.chemical reactionsby reacting sulfuric acid and sodium chloride.This is particularly true for reactions involving.talysts are preferred in many industrial processes.
