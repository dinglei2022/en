May 05,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Vertical lathe machine is similar to the horizontal lathe in which the machine stands up on its ends.Some industries use this instead of horizontal lathe because sometimes space comes up as a constraint.While others prefer it for doing turning and boring on large and heavy rotating parts which cannot be otherwise supported on other lathes.Facing Operations minilatheFacing Operations.Facing is the process of removing metal from the end of a workpiece to produce a flat surface.Most often,the workpiece is cylindrical,but using a 4jaw chuck you can face rectangular or oddshaped work to form cubes and other noncylindrical shapes.When a lathe cutting tool removes metal it applies considerable tangential (i.e.lateral or sideways) force to the workpiece.
