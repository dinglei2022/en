## Compressive strength Wikipedia
Compressive strength or compression strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size,as opposed to tensile strength,which withstands loads tending to elongate.In other words,compressive strength resists compression (being pushed together),whereas tensile strength resistsChapter 4 Material Property Characterization of UltraHighTable 35 shows that the results for the cylinder direct tension and mortar briquette test cracking tensile strength were generally similar for each curing regime.This graph shows the compressive strength gain of U H P C as a function of time after casting.1 MPa = 145 psi.Figure 137.Equation.Compressive strength at any
