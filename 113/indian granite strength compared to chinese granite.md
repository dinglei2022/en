Dwivedi et al.(2008) reported that the tensile strength of Indian granite decreases nearly 27 % from room temperature to 150 C,whereas the compressive strength increases by nearly 11.1 %.Granite WikipediaGranite is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture.Granites can be predominantly white,pink,or gray in color,depending on their mineralogy.The word &quotgranite&quot comes from the Latin granum,a grain,in reference to the coarsegrained structure of such a holocrystalline rock.
