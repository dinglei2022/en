Talc,our State Mineral,is very soft and is used in talcum powder.Talc is a hydrous magnesium silie,Mg6Si8O20(OH)4,and is formed during the metamorphism of ultramafic rocks such as serpentinite.The metamorphism occurs in the presence of hot fluids circulating through the rocks (hydrothermal alteration).Mohs scale of mineral hardness Simple English WikipediaMohs' scale of mineral hardness is named after Friedrich Mohs,a mineralogist who invented a scale of hardness based on the ability of one mineral to scratch another.Rocks are made up of one or more minerals.According to the scale,Talc is the softest: it can be scratched by all other materials.
