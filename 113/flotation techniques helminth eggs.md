## Modified flotation method,an effective technique for
There are a variety of techniques for recovering parasite eggs in fecal matter,including the direct smear method,the flotation method,and the centrifugal flotation or sedimentation method however,a reliable and convenient method for recovering helminth eggs from soil had not been developed.Evaluation of Sugar Flotation and FormalinEther2016415&ensp&#0183&ensptechniques,using no surfaceactive reagent.All types of worm eggs,larvae,and protozoan cysts may be recovered [1921,23].FECT is satisfactory for concentrating helminth eggs and moderately satisfactory for concentrating protozoan cysts [19].It is a good choice for the examination of fecal specimens preserved in formalin [24].

## Efficiency of the salt flotation technique in the recovery
The efficacy of the salt flotation technique using saturated solutions of sodium nitrate (specific gravity 1.30) and zinc sulphate (specific gravity 1.16) for separating Ascaris lumbricoides eggs from clay,loamy and sandy soils has been investigated.Ten samples of each of the egg concentrations of 100,500,2500,5000 and 10,000 eggs 25 g of soil were used for each soil type.201522 flotation for detection of helminth eggs using saturated magnesium sulfate.The results showed that the positive rate of Baylisascaris schro.

## Formal Ether Sedimentation technique for the concentration
Sedimentation techniques use solutions of lower specific gravity than the parasitic organisms,thus concentrating the latter in the sediment.It takes advantage of the high specific gravity of protozoan cysts and helminth eggs compared to water.Their natural tendency to settle out in aqueous solutions can be accelerated by light centrifugation.Geohelminths eggs contamination of sandpits in Vladiv.Geohelminths eggs contamination of sandpits in Vladivostok,Russia.Sand samples were analyzed using combined flotation sedimentation method.In.
