## Influence of particle size distribution of calcium
In this report the effect of particle packing of various calcium carbonate pigments on the whiteness of the final coated paper is studied.Different grades of calcium carbonate pigments of different particle size distribution and optics were used for coating appliions on base papers.Base papers of different optics were also selected.Calcite WikipediaCalcite is a carbonate mineral and the most stable polymorph of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) The Mohs scale of mineral hardness,based on scratch hardness comparison,defines value 3 as "calcite" Other polymorphs of calcium carbonate are the minerals aragonite and vaterite
