sub process The heat rate of a thermal power plant is the amount of chemical energy in the coal that must be required to produce one unit of electrical energy Heat rate is expressed in kcal kWh If a power plant able to convert 100% of the chemical energy in the fuel into electricity,the thermal plant would have a heat rate of 860 kcal kWhPower 101: Flue Gas Heat Recovery in Power Plants,Part ISavings in the fuel and CO 2 emissions cost for a typical 580 MW power plant firing Illinois coal are presented in Figure 3 as functions of the heat rate improvement and cost per ton of CO 2 over.
