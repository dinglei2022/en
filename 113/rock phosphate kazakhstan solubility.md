## Phosphate Wikipedia
The phosphate ion is a polyatomic ion with the empirical formula (PO 4) 3− and a molar mass of 9497 g mol It consists of one central phosphorus atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement The phosphate ion carries a −3 formal charge and is the conjugate base of the hydrogen phosphate ion,H(PO 4) 2−,which is the conjugate base of HPhosphorite WikipediaPhosphorite,phosphate rock or rock phosphate is a non detrital sedimentary rock which contains high amounts of phosphate minerals The phosphate content of phosphorite (or grade of phosphate rock) varies greatly,from 4% to 20% phosphorus pentoxide (P 2 O 5)

## Pelletized Rock Phosphate Midwestern BioAg
Pelletized Rock Phosphate Pelletized rock phosphate has an analysis of 1 to 3 percent water soluble phosphate and 18 to 24 percent calcium Applying pelletized rock phosphate is an excellent way to build soil phosphorus levels and provide plant available phosphorus all season longSoft Rock Phosphate Fertilizer BrokerageSoft Rock Phosphate is an important phosphate source that is actually a byproduct from the old time hard rock mining In order to increase the purity of the higher analysis of the hard rock,the soft rock was a clay impurity which was washed and then it was sent in this water through to a settling pond
