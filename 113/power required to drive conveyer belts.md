## Designing a Conveyor System
The most popular drive is a motor V belt drive to a totally enclosed running in oil torque arm speed reducer which is keyed to the head shaft of the conveyor For a small additional cost an automatic backstop can be added to prevent an inclined conveyor from running backward during a power failureFabric Conveyor Belts Engineering Guide Pooley,IncFabric conveyor belts are manufactured in large widths,transported in coils and then fabricated to any required dimensions.According to the belt construction and target application,fabric belts are distinguished in common "conveyor belts" and highly specialized "processing belts": Conveyor belts
