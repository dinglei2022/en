## Nearest Neighbor Retrieval and Classification UTA
A very commonly used classification method is called nearest neighbor classification,and works as follows: first,we create a database of example objects.For example,we often want to find web pages that are similar to a specific page; in this case the specific page is the query,and the Web (or at least a subset of the&nbsp;.Classification Tree solverClassification tree (decision tree) methods are a good choice when the data mining task contains a classification or prediction of outcomes,and the goal is to generate rules that can be easily.The Classification Tree Algorithm on its own can be used to find one model that results in good classifications of the new data.
