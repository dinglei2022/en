Answer: Anyone who has ever moved it by the shovelful will tell you fresh concrete is heavy,but just how heavy it is depends on the mix proportions and the particular ingredients.A good rule of thumb for most concrete mixtures is 150 pounds per cubic foot.If you fill a 5gallon bucket you've moved nearly 100 pounds of concrete.
