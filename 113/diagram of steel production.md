Modernday steel production makes use of both traditional raw materials (iron) and recycled materials to turn them into steel.With this in mind,here are the 6 steps to modern steel production explained.Step 1 The iron making process.As iron is the main component of steel it firstly needs to be made.Chapter 73.Iron and SteelSteel making was largely a development of the 19th century,with the invention of melting processes; the Bessemer (1855),the open hearth,usually fired by producer gas (1864); and the electric furnace (1900).Since the middle of the 20th century,oxygen conversion,pre eminently the Linz Donowitz (LD) process by oxygen&nbsp;.
