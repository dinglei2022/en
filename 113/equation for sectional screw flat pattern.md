## Flow Rate and Its Relation to Velocity Physics
This equation seems logical enough The relationship tells us that flow rate is directly proportional to both the magnitude of the average velocity (hereafter referred to as the speed) and the size of a river,pipe,or other conduit The larger the conduit,the greater its cross sectional area Figure 1,Fastener Handout University of Wisconsin MadisonThread form is a classifiion based upon the crosssectional profile of the thread.The standard thread form for inch unit threads in U.S.is the Unified (UN) thread form.This thread form is characterized by a 60 degree thread angle and a flat crest and rounded root.Thread series:

## Section modulus
Section modulus is a geometric property for a given cross section used in the design of beams or flexural members.Other geometric properties used in design include area for tension and shear,radius of gyration for compression,and moment of inertia and polar moment of inertia for stiffness.Any relationship between these properties is highly dependent on the shape in question.Layered substrate and method for manufacturing samescrew portion of a molding machine,cutting and.FIG.1 is a side sectional view schematically illustrating.satisfy the relation of the following Equat.
