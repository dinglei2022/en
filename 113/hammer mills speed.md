## Hammer Mill Speed
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;I grew up helping my dad feed the hammer mill every winter.Now I do it myself,but for less cattle.Further information from the Cockshutt 50 manual.Belt pulley speed on the tractor is 1000 rpm at rated engine rpm of 1650.This gives a belt speed in around the 3100 feet per minute and will hopefully be hitting the 3400 rpm point on the hammer.Hammer MillsOur Hammer Mills are commonly used for many different particle reduction applications,including those that require high capacities,extreme power efficiency and uniform particle size.With a Prater hammer mill,you can increase the mill’s throughput capacity without having to increase its power requirements.
