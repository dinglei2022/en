## Dielectric properties of materials 265
The ‘infinite frequency’ dielectric constant,∞,occurs in the infra red,and cannot be directly measured electricallyA value of 50 is appropriate for use with the foregoing data r decreases continuously from this value throughout the infra red to a value of 18 in the optical region The Debye equations therefore become increasingly inaccurate for ωτ,Dow Corning 997 Varnish Bond,Coat Xylene 1 Part,Helical wound coils of No 18 AWG aluminum wire were impregnated with Dow Corning 997 varnish The bond strength was determined as the number of pounds required to break this coil as a simple beam This test is a functional measure of the varnish film strength

## List of materials properties Wikipedia
Tensile strength: Maximum tensile stress of a material can withstand before failure (MPa) Toughness : Ability of a material to absorb energy (or withstand shock) and plastically deform without fracturing (or rupturing); a material's resistance to fracture when stressed; combination of strength and plasticityMica Band Heaters ezheatEZ Heat provides excellent dielectric strength,while permitting rapid and efficient heat migration through the sheath of the heater and into the object requiring heat The use of mica allows the mass of the heater to be kept to a minimum,thus reducing weight,accelerating heat transfer,and keeping costs to a minimum
