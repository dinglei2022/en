## What is Acid Rain? Acid Rain US EPA
What Causes Acid Rain? Acid rain results when sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and nitrogen oxides (NO X) are emitted into the atmosphere and transported by wind and air currents.The SO 2 and NO X react with water,oxygen and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids.These then mix with water and other materials before falling to the ground.What does sulfur dioxide mix with answersA sulfur dioxide has one sulfur atom and two oxygen atoms.Therefore,considering a mole of sulfur dioxide (64g) there is 32g of sulfur and 32g of oxygen.Hence the mass percent of oxygen is 50%.

SGS is a world leader in technology relating to all aspects of cyanide use in gold recovery,including the SO 2 (sulfur dioxide) air process for cyanide destruction.SGS offers a number of cyanide destruction processes.The SO 2 air process is relatively simple and invariably costeffective.During the process,sulfite ions react withHow does sulphur dioxide react with water? QuoraSO2(g) + H2O(l) &gt H2SO3(aq).The equation is balanced as written.Pretty simple,right? That's the equation you're expecting.SO2 is much like CO2.They both dissolve in water and they both form fictitious acids.And like the nonexistent H2C
