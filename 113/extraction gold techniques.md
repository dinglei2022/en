The techniques for extraction of copper from oxidized ores are quite different from those employed for the sulfide ores.The oxidized ores,consisting of the silies,carbonates and sulfates,are treated by several methods,all involving some form of leaching of the crushed ore with sulfuric acid to produce impure solutions of copper sulfate.Gold mining WikipediaPlacer mining is the technique by which gold that has accumulated in a placer deposit is extracted.Placer deposits are composed of relatively loose material that makes tunneling difficult,and so most means of extracting it involve the use of water or dredging.
