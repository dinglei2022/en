## Is Copper Sulfate Toxic To Fish? Algae Treatment
Jun 21,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32Copper sulfate has been used for many years as an algaecide and a parasite treatment.The problem with the use of copper is that there is a thin line that separates effective treatment levels from overdoses,which can kill fish.Copper ions are highly toxic to fish,so care must be taken with the dosage.Copper Sulfate Wood Treatment eHow&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Copper is a natural fungicide: in other words,it makes it very difficult for fungus and mold to grow on the wood.If any spores try to grow,they are poisoned by the copper elements and die.This makes copper treatment common for timbers that are meant to be used.
