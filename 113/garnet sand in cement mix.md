## A Study on the Magnesium Sulfate Resistance of Garnet
This study investigated the resistance of garnet fiber concrete (hereinafter,GFC) to magnesium sulfate.GFC was fabried in various mix ratios using GA,nylon (Ny),polypropylene (PP),and others.Plain concrete without GA was also fabried for comparison with GFC.The test pieces were soaked in 10% magnesium sulfate for up to 210 days to test their compressive strengths,sulfateSand Mix 60 lb at Menards®Sand Mix features a contractor grade of sand and Portland cement for topping and repairing concrete surfac Sand Mix can be installed in applications as thick at 2? and down to &#188;?
