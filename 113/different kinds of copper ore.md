## What is Ore?
A piece of copper ore Lesson Summary Ores are a special type of rock deposit that contain a large enough amount of a particular mineral (almost always a metal) to be economically practical to extract.Using Copper Ore and Hematite Fine Particles as Raw …Two kinds of oxygen carriers are successfully prepared by the spray drying method,Fe100 (the mass ratio of hematite is 100%) and Cu20Fe80 (the mass ratio of copper ore hematite is 20:80%),and their performance is evaluated in a batch fluidized bed reactor.
