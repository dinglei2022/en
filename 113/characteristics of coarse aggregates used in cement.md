## Recycled Aggregates The Portland Cement Association
It is generally accepted that when natural sand is used,up to 30 percent of natural crushed coarse aggregate can be replaced with coarse recycled aggregate without significantly affecting any of the mechanical properties of the concrete.As replacement amounts increase drying shrinkage and creep will increase and tensile strength and modulus.
