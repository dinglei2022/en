## (PDF) STUDY OF BEHAVIOR OF CONCRETE USING COCONUT SHELL,
Concrete a composite man made material is the most widely used building material in the construction industry It consists of a rationally chosen mixture of binding material such as lime or cement,well graded fine and coarse aggregates,water andA Study on the Utilization of Coconut Shell as Coarse,the compressive,tensile and flexural behavior of concrete modified with coconut shell aggregate In order to test the above properties and compare with that of concrete without any coconut shell aggregate,a control concrete mix was designed as per IS 10262 2009 [8] for concrete of grade of M20
