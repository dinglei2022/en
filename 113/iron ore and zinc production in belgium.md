## Electrolysis of iron in a molten oxide electrolyte.
Direct iron production at molten metal state from iron oxides by the sole application of electrical energy represents a possible route to decarbonize steel industry.Although chemically simple,this reaction is difficult to implement due to the problem of the multiple valence states of iron and to an operating temperature above 1811 K.Thermal,chemical,and electrical conditions have been.How the Iron Ore Market Works VALE RIOnbsp 0183 32 Mines in Michigan and Minnesota account for the bulk of iron ore production in the United States In 2019 U S mines produced 48 million metric tons of iron ore Australia led production

## Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics
 · Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron containing ores.﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore,leaving behind a soft,malleable iron metal.Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.Europe's Copper IndustryCopper mining also provides many valuable by products that can be used in advanced material applications.For example,it is responsible for the production of almost 500,000 tonnes of cobalt,molybdenum,rhenium,selenium,tellurium and rare earth elements,in addition to volumes of silver,tungsten,gold,lead and zinc.
