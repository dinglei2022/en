## GRADE OF CONCRETE And their type of Grade
GRADE OF CONCRETE Concrete of Grade is a mixture of Portland cement,water,and coarse and fine aggregates.It consolidates into a hard mas because of a chemical reaction called hydration between cement and water.Proportioning a concrete mix for a given.Durability Evaluation in Concrete Using Cracked Permeability.The addition of fine quarry dust in concrete.Ordinary Portland cement of grade 53 which had a.cement content varied from 300kg m3 to 400.
