## ANSYS AIM Heat Conduction in a Hollow Cylinder SimCafe,
Sep 12,2017&#0183;&#32;Heat Conduction in a Cylinder Created using ANSYS AIM 181 Problem Specification Consider the hollow cylinder pictured below with outer radius (r o =325in),inner radius (r i =175in) and length (l=10 ft)The temperature at the inner radius of the cylinder is 400 degrees Fahrenheit while the outside radius of the cylinder is 80 degrees Fahrenheit with a coefficient of heat transfer of 004..of controlling heat conduction in cylinder cap .suction in said chamber and said space communicating between the refrigerant passage,with respect to the space outside of the cylinder head tightly sealed.
