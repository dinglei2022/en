The hardness of kyanite is approximately 4.5 when scratched parallel to the long axis of the crystal and approximately 6.5 when scratched perpendicular to or across the long axis.Other minerals usually have variable hardness on different crystal faces due to a different concentration and orientation of the atoms in theKyanite New World EncyclopediaJun 16,2018.Kyanite is a member of the aluminosilicate subgroup of silicate minerals.It is typically blue,but its color may vary.It is used in porcelain.
