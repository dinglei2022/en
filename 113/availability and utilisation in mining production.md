## Mining Fleet Optimization and OEE MPPIglobal
Production OEE as a concept is a measurement of mine production capacity considering all aspects of an operation such as customer demand,availability,utilization,performance and quality We have very well defined measures for how to calculate Production OEE for a mobile mining fleet and with the implementation of the right systems and.Food production &amp; availability(i) Availability refers to the physical availability of food stocks in desired quantities.Using food grains as a proxy for food (reasonable enough in a context where food grains account for a large share of food intake),availability of food grain is given by domestic production net of feed,seed and wastage plus net imports plus draw down of stocks.

Plant uptime and production uptime.Plant Uptime is a process or production performance measure or KPI which is used extensively in many industries as an alternative or together with plant downtime.It is sometimes preferred to plant downtime because it incorporates all the possible downtime causes both scheduled and unscheduled therefore representing the time that the plant is actually up and.Standardizing Availability Definition8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;possible for operational availability and,therefore,plant production.If the Aa curve is not known,manufacturing operations management may unknowingly attempt to achieve performance beyond that which is possible.The result is the overspending and overtaxing of maintenance resources.Achievable availability is the result of several factors:

## Reliability Basics: Availability and the Different Ways to,
Availability is an important metric used to assess the performance of repairable systems,accounting for both the reliability and maintainability properties of a component or system Did you know,though,that there are different classifications of availability and different ways to calculate it? This article will explore the different availability classifications,what they mean and how they.Mine production index (MPI) extension of OEE for,The effort with this study is to propose methodology which can be used for bottleneck detection in mining and can be applied to most of the equipment in mining operation For this purpose,based on the literature,three main parameters used in OEE,namely availability,utilization and production performance,have been selected
