## What is Silica Sand?
Frac Sand Mineralogy: Frac sand must be greater than 99% quartz to be suitable for use as a proppant.Frac Sand Specifications : Roundness,highly spherical,high crush resistance,silicon dioxide content,and consistent size are all important factors relating to high quality frac sand.To have high fluid porosity and permeability,frac sand must be well sorted to be effective when applied.How sand is madeSand is extracted from the location at which it occurs by either a floating dredge or front loader.The dredge delivers a slurry of sand and water to the processing plant via pipeline,while the front loader simply scoops the sand up and into trucks or onto conveyor belts for transporation to the plant.
