## Rolling Introductory concepts
thickness in cold rolling,a series of rolling mills may be used to share the total reduction.One important application of cold rolling is the removal of yield point from mild steel sheets using skin pass rolling [temper rolling].In this the steel sheet is given a light reduction of 0.5 to 1.5%.Such a process eliminates yield point elongation.cold rolling mill process flow chartIn terms of usage,hot rolling processes more tonnage than any other manufacturing process,and cold rolling processes the most tonnage out of all cold working processes.[1] [2] Roll stands holding pairs of rolls are grouped together into rolling mills that can quickly process metal,typically steel,into products such as structural steel ( I beams,angle stock,channel stock),bar stock.
