4SiO2) and petalite (Li2O,Al2O3.8SiO2).Spodumene has a theoretical Li2O content of.8.03%.Due to its high lithium content,spodumene is considered the most important lithium ore mineral.A typical run of mine ore can contain 1 2% Li2O,while a typical spodumene concentrate suitable for lithium carbonate production.What is Lithium Extraction and How Does It Work?By definition,lithium extraction is a set of chemical processes where lithium is isolated from a sample and converted to a saleable form of lithium,generally a stable yet readily convertible compound such as lithium carbonate.Most lithium extraction processes entail some form of mining to reach underground deposits of lithium rich minerals.
