## abrasive machining processes
SiC abrasives are harder than friable Al 2 O 3 but they are usually inferior for grinding most ferrous materials.This is due to the dissociation of SiC to react with and adhere to iron at elevated temperatures.(Affinity of silicon or carbon for the workpiece ) 2 O 3Solutions for thinning,dicing and packaging of power2013125&ensp&#0183&enspSolutions for thinning,dicing and packaging of power devices made of Si,Sapphire,SiC and GaN Nov.7th,2013 SiC Grinding by GS08 and Dry Polishing 4 Roughness: much finer than commonly used wheel for SiC (grinding process) with 5 chuck tables 4 cassette stages Small footprint
