## Productivity at the mine face: Pointing the way forward McKinsey
Should a mine reduce its workforce? Should it increase capital spending to improve equipment? Should it increase output at all costs? How will each of these initiatives affect the others? For example,how will reducing the labor force affect output,and how much additional output will a capitalspending program produce?Do Investors Forecast Fat Firms? Evidence from the Gold MiningConventional economic theory assumes that firms always minimize costs given the output they produce.The value of a costminimizing,profitmaximizing firm is convex in the price of a competitively supplied input or output,but we find that the stock values of many gold mining companies are concave in the price of gold.
