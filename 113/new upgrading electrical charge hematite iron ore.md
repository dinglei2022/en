## Hematite
2020 2 11&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Hematite is colored black to steel or silver gray,brown to reddish brown,or red.It is mined as the main ore of iron.Varieties include kidney ore,martite (pseudomorphs after magnetite),iron rose and specularite (specular hematite).While these forms vary,they all have a rust red streak.DRY BENEFICIATION OF BAUXITE MINERALS USING A …Normally,the beneficiation or treatment of bauxite is limited to crushing,sieving,washing,and drying of the crude ore [3].Flotation has been employed for the upgrading of certain low grade bauxite ores,however it has not proven highly selective at rejecting kaolinite,a major source of reactive silica especially in trihydrate bauxites [9].

## Iron ore Wikipedia
Increasing iron ore demand,coupled with the depletion of highgrade hematite ores in the United States,after World War II led to development of lowergrade iron ore sources,principally the utilization of magnetite and taconite.Ironore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined.HematiteRyen Caenn.George R.in Composition and Properties of Drilling and Completion Fluids (Seventh Edition),2017.Iron Oxides—Fe 2 O 3.Hematite Itabirite—Research and actual field use has shown hematite to be an excellent alternative to barite.Hematite is an ore composed chiefly of a soft micaceous hematite and small amounts of quartz.
