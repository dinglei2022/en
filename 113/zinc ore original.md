Jan 19,2013&#0183;&#32;The zinc content of a 171 g ore sample was determined by dissolving the ore in HCl,which reacts with the zinc,and then neutralizing excess HCl with NaOH The reaction of HCl with Zn is shown below Zn + 2 HCl yields ZnCl2 + H2 The ore was dissolved in 150 mL of 0600 M HCl,and the resulting solution was diluted to a total volume of 300 mLOrigin Franklin ore depositVolume 14,pages 221,1929 THE ORIGIN OF THE ZINC DEPOSITS AT FRANKLIN AND STERLING HILL,NEW JERSEY W.A.TARR,University of Missouri.The origin of the zinc deposits at Franklin and Sterling Hill,New Jersey,is a question of great interest to the student of mineralogy and ore …
