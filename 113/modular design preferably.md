## Modules flowdesign
In Flow Design a module is a source code container for logic and data which helps to create evolvability.But of course you&#39re welcome to use Flow Design and interpret it in a more FPlike manner.With components contracts become explicit entities of their own preferably even wrapped up in their own libraries.A modularbased approach for JustInTime Specifiion ofFeb 7,2018 In modular design theory [23],the concept of a module is used to represent a physical or conceptual grouping of product components to form a.and requiring different material,i.e.modules that should be balanced individually,should preferably be specified before planning the second assignment step.

## Modular Design for Rapid Advances Interaction Design Foundation
Jan 1,2016 Modular design is the practice of subdividing a product into its components modules to develop a better understanding of how it works.Once something has been deconstructed in this way it can be a figurative exercise,rather than physically taking something apart we can identify areas for potentialDeveloping Modular Manufacturing System Architectures AAUPaper 4: Joergensen,S Hvilshøj,M Madsen,O.2012,Designing Modular Manufacturing Systems using Mass Customization theories and methods International Journal of Mass Customization.(IJMassC) Vol.4,No.3 3,pp.171194.This thesis has been submitted for assessment in partial fulfillment of the PhD degree.
