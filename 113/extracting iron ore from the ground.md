## Environmental Impact Economics Metal Extraction mining
mining iron ore costs are omitted energy machinery involved in digging out the ore,crushing it,transporting the ore,and the cost of actually extracting the iron from its finite ore resource chemicals needed (coke,limestone),constructing and running a blast furnace So,scrap metal merchants are doing a roaring trade at the moment.GCSE Metals Revise Problems of Extraction from OresAs part of their work on metals,GCSE chemistry students will look at some of the problems that arise in their extraction from ores.As with most things,there is a financial cost,but there's also an environmental one.Revise what you learned in Year 10 and Year 11 by playing this interactive quiz.
