## Concrete manufacture with unraded recycled aggregates
The research shows the risk of mixing concrete using a simple aggregate replacement without careful aggregate grading and adjustments to the mix design.CEMENT CONCRETE MIX DESIGN DronacharyaThe grading of aggregate influences the mix proportions for a specified workability and water cement ratio Coarser the grading leaner will be mix which can be used Very lean mix is not desirable since it does not contain enough finer material to make the concrete cohesive The type of aggregate influences strongly the aggregate
