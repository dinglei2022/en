## Experimental Study On Extraction Of Scandium From …
However,the industrial application of scandium is still limited because its extraction and separation from ores is difficult (Xu et al.2013).The scandium content in rare earth minerals,such as monazite and bastnasite,is in the range of 20 to 50 ppm (Wang et al.2011).An innovative process for extracting scandium from …To investigate the mechanism of scandium carbide formation from scandium oxide and graphite,EPMA analysis was carried out on the sample smelted at high carbon ratio of 0.5 ().The pelletized sample that maintained its shape during smelting was carbon coated and directly used for the analysis without polishing,to minimize the introduction of carbon or oxygen from epoxy.
