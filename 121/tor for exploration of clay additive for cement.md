## Core Sampling in Geotechnical Drilling Fordia
Drilling additives that protect equipment.Drilling fluid additives can also play an important role in helping to minimize the wear and tear on equipment,cool the core bits and extend their life.Some additives are abrasive though and the water pump must be able to handle bentonite or other additives.Feasibility of Natural Clay Additives in Cement MortarCement,clay,sand,and water mixed block preparation: The powdered clay was mixed in separate with cement by using a homemade ball mill machine as shown in Figure 1,using four balls (&#216; 11 mm) for 20 minutes,forming clay and cement composite The additive clay levels were selected as 10 and 20 wt% in cement
