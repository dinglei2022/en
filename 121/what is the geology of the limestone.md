Geologic Origin of Limestone: Most limestone forms in warm,shallowmarine environments through the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) out of seawater.The precipitate settles to the seafloor and accumulates as a blanket of carbonate mud.The calcareous remains of marine organisms,including the tests and shells of invertebrate animalsWhat is Limestone? GraniteLimestone makes up approximately 10 percent of the total volume of all sedimentary rocks.Pure limestones are white or almost white.Because of impurities,such as clay,sand,organic remains,iron oxide and other materials,many limestones exhibit different colors,especially on weathered surfaces.

Younger rocks of Paleozoic age surround this Precambrian core,chiefly dolomite and sandstone with some shale and limestone.They start with rocks of Cambrian (beige),then Ordovician (pink) and Silurian (lilac) age.A small area of even younger Devonian rocks (bluegray) crops out near Milwaukee,but even these are a third of a billion years old.Geologic Map of Arizona data.azgs.az.govThis unit includes the Tapeats Sandstone,Bright Angel Shale,Muav Limestone,Temple Butte Formation and Redwall Limestone in northern Arizona,and the Bolsa Quartzite,Abrigo Formation,Martin Formation,and Escabrosa Limestone in southern Arizona.These rocks record intermittent sealevel rise and inundation in early Paleozoic time.

## Micrite limestone
Micrite is one of the most common carbonate rocks.Most of what people call &quot limestone&quot is largely or exclusively micrite.As with clay (shale) it is deposited in generally quiet water,and appears in any environment where those conditions exist.This specimen could have come from a tidal lake,or a subtidal lagoon,or some similar environment.What Type of Rock Is Bluestone? Hunker&quotBluestone&quot is a colloquial term that usually refers to sedimentary rocks,like sandstone or limestone,that appear bluegray in color.The most common types of bluestone consist of sediments that underwent millions of years of compression to become stone.

Carbonate rocks such as limestone and dolomite more than 15,000 feet (5,000 meters) thick make up the platform and underlie Dry Tortugas National Park.These rocks continue to form as the calcareous shells and skeletons of dead sea life are deposited on submerged areas of the platform.What Are the Properties of Limestone? ReferenceIts chemical formula is CaCO3 and it is where many fossils are found.Calcium carbonate is limestone that contains at least 95 percent calcium and magnesium limestone is limestone in which some of the calcium has been replaced with magnesium.Limestone is an acid sensitive stone,similar to marble.
