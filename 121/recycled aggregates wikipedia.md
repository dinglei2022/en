## Recycling by product Wikipedia
Concrete aggregate collected from demolition sites is put through a crushing machine,often along with asphalt,bricks,dirt,and rocks.Smaller pieces of concrete are used as gravel for new construction projects.Crushed recycled concrete can also be used as the dry aggregateReclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) WikipediaReclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) is defined as removed pavement materials containing asphalt and aggregates.These materials are generated when asphalt pavements are removed for reconstruction,resurfacing,or to obtain access to buried utilities.

Sometimes two rights make a wrong.Recycled,reused or repurposed building materials can conflict with other environmental initiatives.For instance,many green buildings are extremely energyefficient,in part because of new synthetic materials that provide greater insulation and strength than traditional materials.Maryland Recycled Aggregates Laney RecyclingOur recycled aggregates offer a greater yield than crushed stone and are approved by most local jurisdictions.Whether you choose to use recycled aggregates to reduce costs,minimize environmental impact,improve construction waste management or earn LEED points,The

Recycled aggregates (from construction,demolition,and excavation waste) are increasingly used as partial replacements for natural aggregates,while a number of manufactured aggregates,including aircooled blast furnace slag and bottom ash are also permitted.The size distribution of the aggregate determines how much binder is required.Effect of Recycled Coarse Aggregate on Concrete PropertiesAbstract.This research was conducted with the use of recycled aggregate as modifiion.In terms of the use of recycled aggregate,the percentage of recycled aggregate should be determined because the strength of concrete would not be obtained by the high percentage of recycled aggregate.The scope of study is about comparison between recycle coarse aggregate and natural aggregate in terms of

## Construction aggregate Wikipedia
Construction aggregate,or simply &quotaggregate" is a broad egory of coarse to medium grained particulate material used in construction,including sand,gravel,crushed stone,slag,recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates.Aggregates are the most mined materials in the world.Characteristics of Aggregates Civil SnapshotAggregates must conform to certain requirements and should consist of clean,hard,strong,and durable particles free of chemicals,coatings of clay,or other fine materials that may affect the hydration and bond of the cement paste.The characteristics of the aggregates influence the properties of the concrete.
