## ThermocoupleThermocouplesWhat is a thermocoupleTypes
A Thermocouple is a sensor used to measure temperature.Thermocouples consist of two wire legs made from different metals.The wires legs are welded together at one end,creating a junction.This junction is where the temperature is measured.When the junction experiences a change in temperature,a voltage is created.MANGANESE ORE AND ALLOYS PILOTING TOOLS ATMANGANESE ORE AND ALLOYS PILOTING TOOLS AT ERAMET RESEARCH A.Soller1,A.Amalric1,Many thermocouples,embedded above,under and in the sinter mix enable to control the firing and gas temperatures,as well as the sintering front loion evolution (Fig.mm fraction and use it in the sinter plant.

Most all furnace use the same thermocouple.Stype.Very accurate,even the Chinese brand use the same thermocouple.What are Thermocouples Used For? SciencingThermocouples are the most popular type of temperature sensors.They are used as hospital thermometers,and in diagnostics testing for vehicle engines.Some gas appliances such as boilers,water heaters,and ovens use them as safety features if the pilot light is out,the thermocouple stops the gas valve from operating.
