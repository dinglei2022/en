## Coal prices and outlook U.S.Energy Information
Transportation costs add to the delivered price of coal.In some cases,such as in longdistance shipments of Wyoming coal to power plants in the East,transportation costs are more than the price of coal at the mine.Most coal is transported by train,barge,truck,or a combination of these modes.All of these transportation modes use diesel fuel.How Is Coal Used Today? ReferenceCoal is also used in the steel manufacturing process,which utilizes coke,a byproduct of burning coal.Some structures and industrial installations still use coal for heating the actual structure,though these are becoming quite rare.Most modern industrial uses for coal,outside of electricity production,involve large coalfired furnaces.
