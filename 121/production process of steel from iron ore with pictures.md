## How is Iron Refined from Ore? (with pictures)
Oct 15,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Although iron does not occur in its pure form in nature,some kinds of ore contain up to 70% iron atoms.Iron ore consists of oxygen and iron atoms bonded together into molecules.To create pure iron,one must deoxygenate the ore,leaving only iron atoms behind,which is the essence of the refining process.Production of iron and steel SlideShareApr 27,2015&nbsp&#0183&#324 27 2015 22 Introduction Production of Iron &amp Steel Steel is essential to everyday life cars,trains,buildings,ships,bridges,refrigerators,medical equipment,for example,are all made with steel.Raw Materials A blast furnace Uses iron ore,coke (made from specialist coking coals) and small quantities of limestone (iron ore,coke and

## The History of Steel
Aug 27,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32One of the earliest forms of steel,blister steel,began production in Germany and England in the 17th century and was produced by increasing the carbon content in molten pig iron using a process known as cementation.In this process,bars of wrought iron were layered with powdered charcoal in stone boxes and heated.Steel manufacture SteelConstruction.infoIron and steel making byproducts.As with all largescale manufacturing processes,the production or iron and steel generates byproducts.On average the production of 1 tonne of steel results in 200 kg (EAF) to 400 kg (BF BOF) of byproducts.The main byproducts produced during iron and crude steel production are slags (90%),dusts and sludges.

## Steelmaking Wikipedia
Steelmaking is the process of producing steel from iron ore and or scrap.In steelmaking,impurities such as nitrogen,silicon,phosphorus,sulfur and excess carbon (most important impurity) are removed from the sourced iron,and alloying elements such as manganese,nickel,chromium,carbon and vanadium are added to produce different grades of steel.Understanding US iron ore production CRUUS Steel produces marginally less iron ore than Cliffs,owning two mines in the Mesabi Range to supply the company's integrated steel production.The Keetac and Minntac mines currently produce a cumulative ~19 Mt y of BF pellets,which get shipped from Duluth to US Steel's BFs in the country.
