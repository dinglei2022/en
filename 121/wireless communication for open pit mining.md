## Design and implementation of the communiion system
Request PDF on ResearchGate On Jan 1,2017,Jing He and others published Design and implementation of the communiion system based on wireless communiion for openpit mineMine Communiions &amp Wireless Mining Mesh NetworkWireless communiions products operating in this setting must be ruggedized and be capable of handling extreme temperatures and weather conditions,shock and vibration,as well as dirt and dust.Often,the active mining site is transient so the network must be easy to move and setup in different loions around the mine every few months.
