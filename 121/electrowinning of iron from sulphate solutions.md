## Electrowinning of cobalt from acidic sulphate solutions,
Abstract Cobalt electrowinning from acidic sulphate solution was carried out in the presence and absence of chloride ion in the electrolyte The effect of current density,electrolyte flow rate and temperature on cobalt electrowinning was studied from pure cobalt sulphate solutions and solutions containing 2000 mg dm‚àí3 chloride ionElectrowinning of iron from sulphate solutions ScienceDirectIn order to throw some light on what has been done in the past concerning electrowinning of iron from aqueous solutions,the authors have collected available information about an extensive project on electrowinning of iron from sulphate solutions,that was carried out some 50 years ago in Norway

## Electrowinning of Iron from Spent Leaching Solutions Using,
A South African mining group is investigating the use of electrowinning (EW) to recover iron and H 2 SO 4 from an iron sulphate waste solution produced during metal beneficiation For the purpose of this paper,the term electrowinning,as is commonly applied for this process,is used throughout the paperEffect of nickel and magnesium on zinc electrowinning,Effect of nickel and magnesium on zinc electrowinning using sulfate solutions,Iron increases the nucleation overpotential,inhibiting zinc deposition,but has no significant influence on the morphology of the deposit when glue is present (Muresan et al,1996) Copper has a harmful effect on zinc electrowinning

## Electrowinning Wikipedia
Electrowinning,also called electroextraction,is the electrodeposition of metals from their ores that have been put in solution via a process commonly referred to as leaching Electrorefining uses a similar process to remove impurities from a metalIron(II) sulfate WikipediaIron(II) sulfate (British English: iron(II) sulphate) or ferrous sulfate denotes a range of salts with the formula Fe SO 4 xH 2 O These compounds exist most commonly as the heptahydrate (x = 7) but are known for several values of x The hydrated form is used medically to treat iron deficiency,and also for industrial applications
