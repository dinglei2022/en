## It's Elemental The Element Lithium
It was first isolated by William Thomas Brande and Sir Humphrey Davy through the electrolysis of lithium oxide (Li 2 O).Today,larger amounts of the metal are obtained through the electrolysis of lithium chloride (LiCl).Lithium is not found free in nature and makes up only 0.0007% of the earth's crust.Evidence on the impact of sustained exposure to air2013528&ensp&#0183&enspThis paper's findings suggest that an arbitrary Chinese policy that greatly increases total suspended particulates (TSPs) air pollution is causing the 500 million residents of Northern China to lose more than 2.5 billion life years of life expectancy.The quasiexperimental empirical approach is based on China's Huai River policy,which provided free winter heating via the provision of coal

## How Is Natural Gas Extracted,Processed &amp Refined? Sciencing
Natural gas extraction begins with drilling a well.These wells are purposedrilled for natural gas,but because natural gas is often found in the same deposits as petroleum,sometimes natural gas extraction is a sideoperation of oil extraction,or is pumped back into the well for future extraction.Gravity of Earth Wikipedia20191028&ensp&#0183&enspThe gravity of Earth,denoted by g,is the net acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the combined effect of gravitation (from distribution of mass within Earth) and the centrifugal force (from the Earth's rotation).[2][3] In SI units this acceleration is measured in metres per second squared (in symbols,m s2 or m&#183s−2) or

## Transition from a warm and dry to a cold and wet climate
Although a series of Holocene climatic records have been obtained from lakes and peats in this region,the Holocene hydrological history and its controls remain unclear.More specifically,it is currently debated whether NE China experienced a dry or wet climate during the early Holocene.Alkaline earth metal Wikipedia20191015&ensp&#0183&enspThe alkaline earth metals are all silvercolored and soft,and have relatively low densities,melting points,and boiling points.In chemical terms,all of the alkaline earth metals react with the halogens to form the alkaline earth metal halides,all of which are ionic crystalline compounds (except for beryllium chloride,which is covalent).
