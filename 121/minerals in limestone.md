## What Is the Difference Between Limestone & Calcite? Hunker
Calcite is a mineral that occurs in the natural geological processes of the Earth Calcite is a form of calcium carbonate,a type of calcium salt oxide with three atoms of oxygen bonded to one atom of calcium Calcite binds with other compounds to create limestone which is used in construction.Mineral Chemical Composition Limestone New DNRMineral and Chemical Composition of Pure Limestone wt.% wt.% wt.% wt.% wt.% ratio wt.% wt.% wt.% ratio wt.% wt.% wt.% ratio wt.% wt.% wt.% ratio wt.% Calcite Dolomite CaCO3 MgCO3 CaCO3 MgCO3 CaO MgO CaO MgO Ca(OH)2 Mg(OH)2 Ca(OH)2 Mg(OH)2 Ca Mg Ca Mg CO2 Prepared by Missouri Department of Natural Resources,Division of Geology and Land Survey,2011
