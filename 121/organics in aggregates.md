## Weeds in Stone &amp Gravel Driveways a Superior Solution
Q.I have a gravel driveway,and a lot of weeds tend to grow in it.Is there something not too harmful that will sterilize the ground for 6 months or more I could use to keep the weeds down? {Short answer from McG: No.No such thing exists,chemical or organic.}P.S.: Your advice about using shredded leaves for mulch was great my privet hedge never looked so good!Enforcing Extended Porphyrin JAggregate Stacking inThe potential of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for realizing porous,crystalline networks with tailored combinations of functional building blocks has attracted considerable scientific interest in the fields of gas storage,photoalysis,and optoelectronics.Porphyrins are widely studied in biology and chemistry and constitute promising building blocks in the field of electroactive

## Organic matter and water‐stable aggregates in soils
The water‐stability of aggregates in many soils is shown to depend on organic materials.The organic binding agents have been classified into (a) transient,mainly polysaccharides,(b),temporary,roots and fungal hyphae,and (c) persistent,resistant aromatic components associated with polyvalent metal ions,and strongly sorbed polymers.The effectiveness of various binding agents atImproving Aggregate Stability Cornell Universitymethods can reduce the loss of organic matter and aggregate destruction.Organic Matter Additions Adding organic materials,such as manure or mulch residues,can provide the soil with both nutrients and organic matter,while improving aggregate stability over time.The latter is a result of greater amounts of organic carbon
