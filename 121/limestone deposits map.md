## Limestone: The Calcium Carbonate Chemical. Geology
Sedimentary limestone deposits can be extensive,covering hundreds of square miles,and can be relatively uniform in thickness and quality.Therefore,limestone quarries can be large and long lived,mining limestone layers that can be hundreds of feet thick over areas of several square miles.Many quarries produce multiple products,and crushed rocks that are not pure enough for certain uses.Limestone Industry University of KentuckyThe Warsaw Limestone contains thick deposits of high calcium limestone and is a medium gray,fine to coarse grained limestone containing fossil material in a chalk like matrix.Other parts of the Warsaw may be high calcium but are not as pure a limestone.
