## Air classifiion of solid particles: a review
An overview is given of modern air classifiion devices,their operation principles,features and parameters,as cut size,cleanness and recovery.We outline the separation zones common to existing classifiers.In practice,various gravitational and centrifugal classifiers are employed,including those with vertical and horizontal air streamsClassifying NETZSCH Grinding &amp DispersingCustomarily products with a particle size range of &gt100 &#181m can be classified without difficulty using a screening machine,however,air classifiers are essential for finer particle size distributions that require a more controlled separation.Typical appliions for our fine classifiers are the separation of undesired coarse grains and the
