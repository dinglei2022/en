## Phosphate rock: origin,importance,environmental impacts
Phosphate rock (PR) is an important mineral resource with numerous uses and appliions in agriculture and the environment.PR is used in the manufacture of detergents,animal feed,and phosphate (PO 4 3 ) fertilizers.Leaching or runoff losses from PR products like PO 4 3 fertilizers,animal feeds,and detergents could cause eutrophiion of surface waters enriched in PO 4 3 byWhy does phosphate rock contain uranium? Earth sciencePhosphate rock does not become enriched with uranium thorium radium until the extraction process separates and concentrates these metals.When the phosphate rock is treated with sulfuric acid,the uranium and thorium become concentrated in the aqueous phase

Apr 01,2013&nbsp&#0183&#32Most of the phosphorus used in fertilizer comes from phosphate rock,a finite resource formed over millions of years in the earth's crust.Ninety percent of the world's mined phosphate rock is used in agriculture and food production,mostly as fertilizer,less as animal feed and food additives.Phosphate and How Florida Was FormedA "hard rock" phosphate reserve in North Central Florida was discovered next.Thus began Florida's phosphate mining industry.Florida's phosphate mining today accounts for about 80% of the phosphate used in the United States,as well as about 25% of the phosphate used around the world.
