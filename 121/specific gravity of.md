## What Is the Specific Gravity of Water? Sciencing
If the specific gravity is more than 1,the temperature of the sample is 4 degrees C,and it's at atmospheric pressure,the sample contains impurities.If you know which impurity the water sample contains,its specific gravity can tell you the concentration.How to Get Weight From Specific Gravity SciencingSpecific gravity is the density of a substance divided by the density of water.Once you know density,you know mass per unit volume,and from that you can determine the weight.In the imperial measurement system,you have to convert the mass in slugs to weight in pounds.

## Specific Gravity
The table below provides specific gravity ratings for common fluids.As you review the specs for our different float switches,not the specific gravity rating.To achieve bouyancy,the specific gravity of the float must be lower than the specific gravity of the fluid being measured.Water is the benchmark,with a specific gravity of 1.0.Specific gravity Article about specific gravity by The.The specific gravity of the solid is the ratio of its weight in air to the difference between its weight in air and its weight immersed in water.Two methods are commonly used for determining the specific gravities of liquids.One method uses the hydrometer hydrometer,device used to determine directly the specific gravity of a liquid.
