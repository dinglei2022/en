## Quality Control Of Construction Testing Of Concrete Cubes
In order to get a relatively quicker idea of the quality of concrete,optional test for 7 days compressive strength of concrete be carried out.6 Cubes of 150 x 150 x 150 mm size (the nominal size of aggregate does not exceed 38 mm) shall be cast,3 for 7days testing and 3 for 28days testing.British Standard Cube Crushing Test ,British Standard Cube Crushing Test; British Standard Cube Crushing Test A Simple Guide to Concrete Cube Testing QEM Solutions,In the UK,BS 8500 states that the compressive strength of 150mm cubes,The Dutch standard NEN 5950 (now superceded by EN 206) has standard cube test.
