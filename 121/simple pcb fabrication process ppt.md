## PCB Designing: How To Design a PCB (Step by Step)
What is PCB “Printed Circuit Board” ? PCB stands for “Printed circuit board” On this board all the components are soldered and interlinked by the copper tracks The PCB can be a single layer and can go up to many layers as a person want,but most of the software support up to 14 layersPCB Manufacturing Process How are PCB Made Process,PCB Manufacturing Process Flowchart Step by Step Step 1: Patterning or Etching Majority of printed circuit boards are manufactured by applying a layer of copper over the entire surface of the PCB substrate material either on one side or both sid This creates a blank printed circuit board,with the copper everywhere on the surface
