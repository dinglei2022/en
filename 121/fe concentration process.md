## Corrosion as an Electrochemical Process
The corrosion rate is enhanced by an electrochemical process in which a water droplet becomes a voltaic cell in contact with the metal,oxidizing the iron.Considering the sketch of a water droplet (after Ebbing),the oxidizing iron supplies electrons at the edge of the droplet to reduce oxygen from the air.Enhanced Removal of Dissolved Iron and Manganese from.Filtration process Filtration process carried out through two or more filter according to Fe & Mn concentration in the raw water.Problems facing the practical operation and develop appropriate solutions: Recorded changes of Fe & Mn in raw water of the same well and presence of more than one well as a source cause fluctuation of the produced.

The effects of H 2 O 2 concentration,Fe 2+ concentration,pH,and initial phenol concentration on the oxidation of phenol were studied The optimum Fe 2+ and H 2 O 2 concentrations for the Fenton process were 45 and 800 mg L,respectively For the sono Fenton process,the optimum Fe 2+ and H 2 O 2 concentrationsFENTON REACTION CONTROVERSY CONCERNING THE …thought to be a factor,which causes damage to biomolecules and plays a major role in the aging process and a variety of diseases.This article presents a short review on radical and non radical mechanisms of the Fenton reaction postulated in literature,possible reaction pathways as well as various points of view in this field.Keywords: Fenton reaction,Fenton reagent,Fenton chemistry.
