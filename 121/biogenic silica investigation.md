The extraction of biogenic silica from sediment dissolves all forms silica in the sample.The silica components in sediment can be separated between diatoms,sponge spicules,and silie minerals (Conley et al.1993).Distinguishing the source of biogenic silica is possible because of the different dissolution rates of the silica components.Limnological exploration of Flakevatn,a high mountainsilica to the ocean (Conley 1997,Humborg et al.2000,Conley 2002).In general,dissolved silica is essential for formation of amorphous silica by diatoms,phytoliths,radiolarians,silicoflagellates,and sponge spicules (Conley 1988,Conley 1991,Conley 1998).Biogenic silica or polymerized silica in diatoms is more acidic than
