## Froth Flotation Definition of Froth Flotation by Merriam
Froth flotation definition is flotation in which air bubbles are introduced into a mixture of finely divided ore or other material with water and a chemical that aids attachment of the bubbles to the particles of the desired material and its recovery as a froth.Nasaco Mining Technology Mining News and Views UpdatedThe Dowfroth&#162&#226 range of glycol and glycol ether frothers is extended with NASFROTH frothers,based on formulations of alcohols and glycols,which give frothers specific to different appliions.Coal flotation.In the flotation of coal,Nasaco has licensed technology from patents awarded to associate companies in Southern Africa.
