## Chemical characteristics of iron and steel slag : NIPPON,
Chemical composition of iron and steel slag The primary components of iron and steel slag are limestone (CaO) and silica (SiO 2 ) Other components of blast furnace slag include alumina (Alsub&gt;2O 3) and magnesium oxide (MgO),as well as a small amount of sulfur (S),while steelmaking slag contains iron oxide (FeO) and magnesium oxide (MgO)Chemical Composition of SteelSep 28,2017&#0183;&#32;Typical amounts as a residual are less than 0020% Sulphur is present in raw materials used in iron making The steelmaking process is designed to remove it as it is almost always a detrimental impurity A typical amount in commercial steel is 0012%,and 0005% in formable HSLA Silicon can be an addition or a residual As an addition it has.

## 3 CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL INFORMATION
The composition of gasolines varies widely,depending on the crude oils used,the refinery processes available,the overall balance of product demand,and the product specifications The typical composition of gasoline hydrocarbons (% volume) is as follows: 4 8% alkanes; 2 5%Gray Iron Iron Casting Research Institute,IncSep 07,1990&#0183;&#32;Iron of normal composition for the type of casting produced may solidify with a mottled or chilled iron structure if a critical cooling rate is exceeded Such a condition may result from a fin on the casting,or,if the casting has a wide range in section sizes,the foundry may resort to unusually heavy alloy additions to keep the hardness up.
