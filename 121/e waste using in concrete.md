## Use of waste plastic in concrete mixture as aggregate,
Use of waste plastic in concrete mixture as aggregate replacement,(2008) worked on the use of waste plas tics in concrete mixture,as partial replacement of sand at various percentages.Suitability of Biomedical Waste Ash in Concreteconfirmed the successful utilisation of biomedical using biomedical waste ash as partial replacement of cement.This paper presents result of an experiment program carried out to study the suitability of use of biomedical waste ash in concrete as.
