## A Soluble Separation Solution Science Project
Introduction Chemistry is the study of matter and how matter behaves and interacts with other kinds of matter The way that matter behaves is called a property of matter Everything around us is made of matter,and you can explore the properties of matter using some common chemicals around your home One important property of matter is called solubility.Separation of Sand,Iron,and Salt Department of ChemistrySeparation of Sand,Iron,and Salt The components of a mixture are separated based on their physical properti Equipment,The underlying message of the demo is that the physical properties of the components of a mixture can be used to separate them from the mixture This is a simple but important concept that we use in many chemical.

## Sand Casting For Manufacture
When planning the manufacture of a particular casting,remember some properties of a sand casting mold mixture are contradictory to each other Tradeoffs in different properties are often needed to achieve a compromise that provides a sand casting mold mixture with adequate properties for the specific part and casting applicationGray Iron Iron Casting Research Institute,Inc.The processes using sand as the mold media have a somewhat similar these properties are quite different for gray iron as kg load and 10mm ball.
