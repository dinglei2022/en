## SGS AXYS Dioxins &amp Furans SGS AXYS
SGS AXYS specializes in measurement of chlorinated dioxins and furans to picogram or lower concentrations from standard sample sizes.Dioxin precursors Dibenzo1,4dioxin and dibenzofuran are nonchlorinated aromatic compounds with a dioxin and furan backbone.They are regulated in pulp and paper mill defoamers and some other paper pulpTS No.140: Method for Determination of PolychlorinatedDioxins may form in palm oil product during processing (at the milling or refining) or through fallout from surrounding environment that has high level of dioxin content.The palm oil industry is required to analyse for dioxins in palm oil products in order to comply with international food safety regulation.
