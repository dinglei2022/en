The quantum bit of the story tells us that the colour of metals such as silver and gold is a direct consequence of the absorption of photons by d electrons This photon absorption results in d electrons jumping to s orbitalsGold: The mineral native Gold information and picturesThe color of pure Gold is bright golden yellow,but the greater the silver content,the whiter its color is Much of the gold mined is actually from gold ore rather then actual Gold specimens The ore is often brown,iron stained rock or massive white Quartz,and usually contains only minute traces of gold

## Gold,Silver and Bronze Where do these metals come from,
Gold (Au) is a precious metal and has been mined since the ancient Egyptian times; whilst smelting and fusing of gold rich ores has been reported since 3600 BC Gold occurs in many different rock types and geological environments and economic deposits are mainly of two types: lode deposits and placer depositsWhat does rhodium mean? DefinitionsRhodium is a so called noble metal,resistant to corrosion,found in platinum or nickel ores together with the other members of the platinum group metals It was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston in one such ore,and named for the rose color of one of its chlorine compounds,produced after it reacted with the powerful acid mixture.
