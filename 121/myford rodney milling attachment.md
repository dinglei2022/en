## rodney grinding mill ml7 dogscool
Milling on the ML7 Model Engineer.Even with a Rodney milling attachment,it accentiated the lack of rigidity of the ML7.So I bought a Warco Economy Mill Drill (Biggest that would fit in the then workshop) If you take things very gently,you may well be OK.LOTS of superb work done on 7
