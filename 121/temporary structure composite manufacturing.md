## Additive manufacturing of boneforming composite implants
Stereolithography was used to prepare wellfitting implants for defects with complex shapes.A lowtemperature extrusionbased additive manufacturing technique was used to prepare composite structures with designed macroscale porosity (several hundreds of micrometers) and microscale porosity (in the range of ten micrometer).Elastic Plastic Deformation nde edorgA temporary shape change that is self reversing after the force is removed,so that the object returns to its original shape,is called elastic deformation In other words,elastic deformation is a change in shape of a material at low stress that is recoverable after the stress is removed
