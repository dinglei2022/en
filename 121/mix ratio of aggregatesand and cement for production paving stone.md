## Aggregate in Concrete The Concrete Network
You can often save money by selecting the maximum allowable aggregate size.Using larger coarse aggregate typically lowers the cost of a concrete mix by reducing cement requirements,the most costly ingredient.Less cement (within reasonable limits for durability) will mean less water if the watercement (w c) ratio is kept constant.What are the Proper Concrete Mix Proportions?Sep 25,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32What are the Proper Concrete Mix Proportions? There are only four fundamental ingredients in concrete: cement,aggregate,sand,and water,but each serves a particular purpose.Understanding the purpose of each ingredient is key to determining what concrete mix proportions are best in a given situation.The Mix Ratio Concrete â€” the
