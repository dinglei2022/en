Meteoroids become meteors when they crash into Earth's atmosphere and the gases surrounding them briefly light up as "shooting stars." While most meteors burn up and disintegrate in the atmosphere,many of these space rocks reach Earth's surface in the form of meteorites.Some Republicans in Congress Are Worried About AsteroidsApr 19,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Busch referenced a NASA survey,completed in 2010,that identified 90 percent of space objects near the Earth that are greater than one kilometer in diameter—the size that's thought to be big enough to create worldwide effects.None are headed toward Earth any time soon.
