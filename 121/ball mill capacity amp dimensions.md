## Optimum choice of the make up ball sizes for maximum.
For a single size of make up ball,the mass fractions in the mill within the size ranges are calculated from: (11) m k = d k u 4 − Δ − d k l 4 − Δ d max 4 − Δ − d min 4 − Δ where d k u and d k l represent the upper and lower boundaries of th220 Volt Wire Size Guide Dimensions InfoA 220 volt wire size guide will come in handy when trying to determine the wire gauge needed for this type of circuit.It basically depends on how many amperes will be going through the wire.If it is 20 amperes,a 12 gauge wire will be sufficient.The following is a guide to the AWG specs and their maximum copper currents.
