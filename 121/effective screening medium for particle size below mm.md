## Effects of Varying Particle Sizes and Different Types of
For the medium and large particle size modified anthracite substrates,the purifiion effects of total phosphorus,total dissolved phosphorus and phosphate were improved by various degrees,and the purifiion effect of the medium particle size anthracite is better than that of the large size one.Particlesize distribution WikipediaThe particlesize distribution (PSD) of a powder,or granular material,or particles dispersed in fluid,is a list of values or a mathematical function that defines the relative amount,typically by mass,of particles present according to size.Significant energy is usually required to disintegrate soil,etc.particles into the PSD that is then called a grain size distribution.

## Classification of Soil on Particle Size and Moisture Content
Particle Size Classification of Soil There are two soil classification systems in common use for engineering purpos The Unified Soil Classification System is used for virtually all geotechnical engineering work except highway and road construction,where the AASHTO Classification of Soil is used Both systems use the results of grain size analysis and determinations of Atterberg limits to.
