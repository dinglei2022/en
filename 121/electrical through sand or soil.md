## Inherent Factors Affecting Soil EC
Page 1 Guides for Educators Soil electrical conductivity (EC) is a measure of the amount of salts in (salinity of soil)soil.It is an important indicator of soil health.Difference between Sand and Soil Sand vs SoilKey difference: The main difference between the two is that,the soil has pores which allow the water and nutrients to be held,whereas the sand is loose,grainy and does not have pores to hold water or nutrients.Often,people are confused with the terms 'sand and soil',and consider them to be the same.Though,sand is a type of soil,they are quite different from each other.
