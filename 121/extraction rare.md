## Extraction and Separation of Rare Earth Elements from
The extraction of rare earth elements (REEs) was investigated with mixtures of secoctylphenoxyacetic acid (CA12,H2A2) and 2,2′bipyridyl (bipy,B) from nitrateExtraction of rare earths from bauxite residue EuropeanSep 17,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Several methods for recovering valuable metals from bauxite residue have been already reported.Rareearths elements can be recovered by direct leaching with different acids,but their extraction efficiencies depend on the acid concentration upon a significant amount of iron and silicon dissolution,which limits the rareearths recovery.
