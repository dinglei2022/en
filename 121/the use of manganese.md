## Manganese Element information,properties and uses
Manganese is too brittle to be of much use as a pure metal.It is mainly used in alloys,such as steel.Steel contains about 1% manganese,to increase the strength and also improve workability and resistance to wear.Manganese steel contains about 13% manganese.This is extremely strong and is used for railway tracks,safes,rifle barrels andManganese:Uses,Side Effects,Dosage,InteractionsManganese is a mineral that is found in several foods including nuts,legumes,seeds,tea,whole grains,and leafy green vegetables.It is considered an essential nutrient,because the body requires it to function properly.People use manganese as medicine.Manganese is used for prevention and treatment of manganese deficiency,a condition in which the body doesn't have enough manganese.
