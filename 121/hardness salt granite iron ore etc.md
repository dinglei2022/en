## Mohs scale of mineral hardness Wikipedia
The Mohs scale of mineral hardness ( m oʊ z ) is a qualitative ordinal scale characterizing scratch resistance of various minerals through the ability of harder material to scratch softer material.Created in 1812 by German geologist and mineralogist Friedrich Mohs,it is one of several definitions of hardness in materials science,some of which are more quantitative.tungsten carbide sandmaking strip GUBTMetaltungsten carbide sandmaking strip as a core parts of vertical impact crusher (sand making machine),it widely used in mining,gravel,cement,metallurgy,hydropower engineering and other industries,for the need to withstand highspeed impact and strong wear,using super wearable cemented carbide material is the most ideal choice.
