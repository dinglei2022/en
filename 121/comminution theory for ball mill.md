Load behaviour,mill power.2.2 Theories of Comminution.(steel ball and steel rod are contained in ball mill and rod mill),the working theory of ball.A study of comminution in a vertical stirred ball mill.The energy input per ton of grinding media in the stirred ball mill could be 10 times higher than for the tumbling ball mill.Although during coarse grinds the media wear was higher in the stirred ball mill than in the tumbling mill,it became less so as grinding proceeded and for a product median size of 4.8 microns it was the same.
