## DETERMINATION OF AGGREGATE CRUSHING VALUE
The aggregate crushing value gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load.Crushing value is a measure of the strength of the aggregate.The aggregates should therefore have minimum crushing value.3.Insoluble Residue in Carbonate Aggregatesnbsp 0183 32 7 Procedure for Determining Only the Plus 75 μm No 200 Size Fraction of Insoluble Residue 7 1 For many applications only the plus 75 μm No 200 size insoluble residue fraction is of interest This section provides a procedure for determination of the amount
