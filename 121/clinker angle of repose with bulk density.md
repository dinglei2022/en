## Angle of Repose and Handling Dry Bulk Solids
Angle of repose is the angle above a horizontal plane at which a material will naturally rest.When agitated by a rumbling belt conveyor,for example,this angle is significantly but predictably reduced.The dynamic angle of repose,or angle of surcharge,plays a large part in the transporting of dry bulkStandard Test Method for Measuring the Angle of Repose of1.1 Particle size,shape,and bulk density will affect the flowability of powder material.This test method is used for the determination of the angle of repose of freeflowing mold powders.At angles greater than this value this material will flow.1.2 The values stated in inchpound units and degrees are to

## Angle of repose Wikipedia
The internal angle between the surface of the pile and the horizontal surface is known as the angle of repose and is related to the density,surface area and shapes of the particles,and the coefficient of friction of the material Material with a low angle of repose forms flatter piles than material with a high angle of repose
