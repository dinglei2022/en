## Roasting (metallurgy) Wikipedia
Roasting is a process of heating of sulphide ore to a high temperature in presence of air.It is a step of the processing of certain ores.More specifically,roasting is a metallurgical process involving gas solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s).Often before roasting,the ore has already been partially purified,e.g.by froth flotation.FLOWSHEET DEVELOPMENT FOR GOLD OREBODIESroasting the ore or concentrate to burn off the carbon.All of these techniques are relatively expensive however,so the economic cutoff gold grade for refractory ores is somewhat higher than nonrefractory ores.The mining industry uses a "rule of thumb" of 80% gold recovery to define
