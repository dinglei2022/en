## AC Motor Overview & AC Motor Specifications
A special wound rotor AC motor,however,has controllable speed and torque The applications of wound rotor AC motors are markedly different from squirrel cage AC motors because of the rotor circuit’s accessibility Obtaining the AC motor’s performance characteristic is a matter of inserting different resistance values in the rotor circuitAC Generator Definition,Construction and WorkingJun 19,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32AC Generator is an electrical machine which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.The input supply of AC Generator is mechanical energy which is supplied through some primemover and the output is alternating energy in the form of alternating voltage &amp current.In this post we will discuss AC Generator working and construction.

## Synchronous Motor Construction,Principle,Types,
A synchronous motor is an AC motor wherein,at steady state,the rotation of the shaft is synchronized with the frequency of the supplied current; the rotation period is exactly equal to an integral number of AC cycl Fig 1 Synchronous Motor These motors contain multi phase AC electromagnets on the stator of the motor that create a.Motor specifications PetroWikiMotor specifications are key to matching load.Alternating current motors are designed to.(See the NEMA Motor Design section below for more details of the.

## Basic construction and working of a DC Generator.
Construction of a DC machine: Note: A DC generator can be used as a DC motor without any constructional changes and vice versa is also possible.Thus,a DC generator or a DC motor can be broadly termed as a DC machine.These basic constructional details are also valid for the construction of a DC motor.
