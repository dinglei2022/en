## A REVIEW OF GOLD LEACHING IN ACID THIOUREA SOLUTIONS.
Although the cyanidation process has been used in the gold industry for more than a century,it still remains the preferential process for the treatment of gold ores and concentrates because of its simplicity and economy.The anodic half cell reaction for gold dissolution in an acidic solution was suggested by Kazakov et al.Use of ferricyanide for gold and silver cyanidationper manganate (KMnO4) for gold and silver cyanidation process has been proposed with the purpose of increasing gold and silver dissolution rate[4−9].Unfortunately,none of these oxidants has been successfully practiced,probably due to their high cost and potential reactions with free cyanide.On the other hand,the investigations on the
