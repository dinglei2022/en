## Cement kiln chemeurope
Cement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of Portland and other types of hydraulic cement,in which calcium carbonate reacts with silicabearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silies.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per annum,and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity usually define the capacity of the cement plant.Rotary kilnA rotary kiln is a pyroprocessing device used to raise materials to a high temperature (calcination) in a continuous process.Materials produced using rotary kilns include: Cement Lime Refractories Metakaolin Titanium dioxide Alumina Vermiculite Iron ore pellets They are also used for roasting a wide variety of sulfide ores prior to metal.
