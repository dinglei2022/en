## Technology Thorium Power Canada Inc.
There is a vast difference between the use of thorium in conventional technology and its use in Thorium Power Canada technology.One of the key ways Thorium Power Canada's technology differs is that the Thorium Reactors are designed to breed artificial uranium233 from thorium,burn most of that fuel as soon as it is bred,and store the minor amount of unburned fuel.Safety and Regulatory Issues of the Thorium Fuel CycleMay 17,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32Thorium has been widely considered an alternative to uranium fuel because of its relatively large natural abundance and its ability to breed fissile fuel (233 U) from natural thorium (232 Th).Possible scenarios for using thorium in the nuclear fuel cycle include use in different nuclear reactor types (light water,high temperature gas cooled

## Thorium fuel cycle Energy Eduion
The thorium fuel cycle is the path that thorium transmutes through from fertile source fuel to uranium fuel ready for fission.Th232 absorbs a neutron,transmuting it into Th233.Th233 beta decays to Pa233 and finally undergoes a second beta minus decay to become U233.This is the one way of turning natural and abundant Th232 into something fissionable.Development of Tiny Thorium Reactors Could Wean the WorldAug 30,2010&nbsp&#0183&#32The Norwegian firm Aker Solutions bought Rubbia's patent for this thorium fuel cycle,and is working on his design for a proton accelerator.The Telegraph says this $1.8 billion (&#1631.2 billion

The thorium fuel cycle is a nuclear fuel cycle that uses an isotope of thorium,232 Th,as the fertile material.In the reactor,232 Th is transmuted into the fissile artificial uranium isotope 233 U which is the nuclear fuel.Unlike natural uranium,natural thorium contains only trace amounts of fissile material (such as 231 Th),which are insufficient to initiate a nuclear chain reaction.Is Thorium the Fuel of the Future to Revitalize NuclearSince LFTRs use thorium in its natural state,no expensive fuel enrichment processes or fabriion for solid fuel rods are required,meaning the fuel costs are significantly lower than a
