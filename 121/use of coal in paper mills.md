## International Paper spends to cut energy use at paper mills
But many paper mills have historically been big buyers of outside energy as well,either electric power or fuels,such as coal and natural gas,burned in a mill's own boilers.INTERNATIONAL PAPERInternational Paper Brazil Facilities Lead the Way on Solid Waste.In Brazil,where our fiber is supplied by eucalyptus plantations grown near our mill,land application of composted pulp and paper mill residual waste materials returns organic matter and nutrients to the very land that produces the mill’s primary raw material.
