## Which material is the best conductor? AnswersDrive
Although it is the best conductor,copper and gold are used more often in electrical appliions because copper is less expensive and gold has a much higher corrosion resistance.As to why silver is the best conductor,the answer is that its electrons are freer to move than those of the other elements.Conductors and Insulators ndeedOther materials that are sometimes used as conductors are silver,gold,and aluminum.Copper is still the most popular material used for wires because it is a very good conductor of electrical current and it is fairly inexpensive when compared to gold and silver.Aluminum and most other metals do not conduct electricity quite as good as copper.
