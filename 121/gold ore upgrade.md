## Ways to get more gold ingots ore? forum.playrix
2019223&ensp&#0183&enspIt is so slow building up enough gold ore to upgrade anything! Is there a way to get more gold other than digging in the mine? I'm trying to upgrade my trains,but it takes so long to find enough gold that I keep giving in and using the ingots for factory upgrades in order to free up my barn space.Also,this is unrelated but if there are tips on how to "search" through the forums,thatOre box The RuneScape WikiOre boxes are items that store metal ores.Initially,they can store up to 100 of each ore,increased by 20 for certain ores at certain Mining levels (see table below).Completing the Everything Is Oresome achievement (90 Mining required,boostable) also increases storage by 20 for all ores,allowing up to 140 to be stored.These two effects are independent of each other.
