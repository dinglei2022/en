Crushed stone is produced by crushing quarry rock,boulders,cobbles,or largesize gravel.Crushed aircooled blastfurnace slag is also used as fine or coarse aggregate.The aggregates are usually washed and graded at the pit or plant.Some variation in the type,quality,cleanliness,grading,moisture content,and other properties is expected.Section 902 AGGREGATES mdotcf.state.mi.usSection 902.AGGREGATES 902.01.General Requirements.Ensure the fine aggregate portion of the gradation does not exceed crushed stone,iron blast furnace slag,reverberatory furnace slag or a blend of aggregates in accordance with Table 9023 and this subsection.
