## Conventional Ball Mill vs Attritors Union Process
Conventional Ball Mill vs Attritors High Energy Ball Milling In discussions on high energy ball milling,the more generic term “ball mills” is often used in place of the terms “stirred ball mills” or “Attritors,” but the differences between the types of mills are quite distinctGrinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process Control10&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;the milling process takes place during rotation as a result of the transfer of kinetic energy of the moving grinding media into the grinding product.The design of a ball mill can vary significantly depending on the size,the equipment used to load the starting material (feeders),and the system for discharging the output product.
