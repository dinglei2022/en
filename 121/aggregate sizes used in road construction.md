## Aggregates for Concrete
Size numbers (grading sizes) for coarse aggregates apply to the amounts of aggregate (by mass) in percent ages that pass through an assortment of sieves (Fig.5).For highway construction,ASTM D 448 (AASHTO M 43) lists the same 13 size numbers as inAggregate building material BritannicaAggregate,in building and construction,material used for mixing with cement,bitumen,lime,gypsum,or other adhesive to form concrete or mortar.The aggregate gives volume,stability,resistance to wear or erosion,and other desired physical properties to the
