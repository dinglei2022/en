## Watermill Wikipedia
A watermill or water mill is a mill that uses hydropower.It is a structure that uses a water wheel or water turbine to drive a mechanical process such as milling (grinding),rolling,or hammering.Such processes are needed in the production of many material goods,including flour,lumber,paper,textiles,and many metal products.These watermills may comprise gristmills,sawmills,paper millsA Grinding Mill for reliable size reduction tasks RETSCHA modern grinding mill must be able to deal with many tasks while providing a highdegree of grindability,with results that are fine and exact.As demands for higher performance grinding mills are continuously increasing,RETSCH is dedied to incorporate the latest in grinding technology with ever new product developments.Product Overview

## Cryogenic Grinding &amp Attritors
Attritors can generally grind to finer size particle size range than impact or hammer mills by combining the advantages of cryogenic temperatures with both impact and shear forces inherent to high energy internally agitated ball mills.Cryogenic grinding is most effective when the product is sprayed with liquid nitrogen as it is being conveyedSAG mills MetsoSemiautogenous mills or SAG mills,as they are often called,can accomplish the same size reduction work as two or three stages of crushing and screening.Often used in grinding at modern mineral processing plants,SAG mills reduce the material directly to the desired final size or prepare it for the following grinding stages.
