## Cobalt germanide precipitates indirectly improve the
The comparison of microstructures obtained by different synthesis routes (waterquenching and meltspinning followed by spark plasma sintering) reveals the indirect nature of the beneficial influence of cobalt germanide precipitates on the thermoelectric properties of germanium telluride and germanium antimony tellurides (GST materials).Germane WikipediaGermane is the chemical compound with the formula Ge H 4,and the germanium analogue of methane.It is the simplest germanium hydride and one of the most useful compounds of germanium.Like the related compounds silane and methane,germane is tetrahedral.It burns in air to produce GeO 2 and water.Germane is a group 14 hydride

Experiments are designed using Taguchi method to find the optimum parameters for silica sand nanoparticles production using low speed ball milling.Orthogonal array and signaltonoise ratio are applied to study performance characteristics of machining parameters which are the ball to powder weight ratio,volume of milling jar,and rotation speed.Organotin chemistry WikipediaOrganotin compounds or stannanes are chemical compounds based on tin with hydrocarbon substituents.Organotin chemistry is part of the wider field of organometallic chemistry.The first organotin compound was diethyltin diiodide ((C 2 H 5) 2 SnI 2),discovered by Edward Frankland in 1849.The area grew rapidly in the 1900s,especially after the discovery of the Grignard reagents,which are
