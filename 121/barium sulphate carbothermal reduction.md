## Barium carbonate Wikipedia
Barium carbonate is made commercially from barium sulfide either by treatment with sodium carbonate at 60 to 70 &#176C (soda ash method) or by passing carbon dioxide at 40 to 90 &#176C.In the soda ash process,solid or dissolved sodium carbonate is added to barium sulfide solution,and the barium carbonate precipitate is filtered,washed and dried.Carbothermal Reduction of Barium Sulfate Rich Sludge,Pelovski et al studied the reduction of barium sulfate by carbon in the presence of inorganic salts such as sodium carbonate and calcium chloride and observed that these additives promote the reduction of barite However,most of the studies mentioned above were conducted using pure grade barite concentrate

## Barium sulfate — Wikipedia Republished WIKI 2
Almost all of the barium consumed commercially is obtained from barite,which is often highly impure.Barite is processed by carbothermal reduction (heating with coke) to give barium sulfide:.BaSO 4 + 4 C → BaS + 4 CO.In contrast to barium sulfate,barium sulfide is soluble in water and readily converted to the oxide,carbonate,and halides.Nonhazardous Treatment for Barium Slag UsingBarium slag (BS) is an insoluble alkali residue derived from the product of barium compounds following the process of carbothermal reduction and water acid leaching.In this study,two BSderived
