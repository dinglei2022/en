## Processing,smelting and refining gold World Gold Council
From ore to dor&#233.Cyanidation.More gold is recovered by cyanidation than by any other process.In cyanidation,metallic gold is oxidised and dissolved in an alkaline cyanide solution.When gold dissolution is complete,the goldbearing solution is separated from the solids.Silver processing BritannicaA process routinely employed in the fire assaying of gold ores is the addition of silver prior to fusion of the ore in order to ensure that the silver content of the final bead is high enough to dissolve This is called inquartation,and the separating of silver and gold by leaching with nitric acid is referred to as parting

Mineral Processing,Equipment Manufacturers,Ball,Gold CIP Production Line adsorbs gold from cyaniding pulp by active carbon including 7 steps: leaching pulp preparation,cyaniding leaching,carbon adsorption.How Is Gold Processed? ReferenceGold is processed by cyanide milling,a chemical procedure that separates 95 to 98 percent of the gold from raw mined ore.It is then refined to the gold standard purity,according to Mineweb.Heap leaching is a less expensive method of gold extraction,but it is a longer process and it recovers less gold than the cyanide milling process.
