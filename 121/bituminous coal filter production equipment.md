## Eastern Bituminous Coal
Bruce G.Miller,in Clean Coal Engineering Technology,2011.Coal Cleaning.The costs of cleaning Eastern bituminous coals for mercury removal range from no additional cost (for coals already washed for sulfur removal) to a cost of $33,000 per pound of mercury removed [95].The costs for cleaning Powder River Basin subbituminous coals are higher and approach $58,000 per pound of mercury removed.Activated Carbon Calgon Carbon CorporationThe primary raw material used in the production of our activated carbons is bituminous coal that is crushed,sized and processed in low temperature bakers followed by high temperature activation furnaces.The structure of our activated carbon is one of the reasons it’s considered the best in the market.It’s about what’s on the inside.
