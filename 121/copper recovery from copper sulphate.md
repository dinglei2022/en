## Copper recovery from copper(II) sulfate solutions by
This research was inspired by a study where Cu 2+ in copper zinc sulfate solutions was recovered as copper metal by heating for 2 h at 200 &#176C with sawdust (Petlička and Klir,1969).Extraction of metals using wood,cellulose and lignin at temperatures of &gt190 &#176C has also been patented (Goryachkin etUS3597154A Recovery and purifiion of copper sulfateThe recovered precipitate of dibasic copper sulfate from one recovery cycle is combined in a regenerating zone with hot aqueous effluent.The dibasic copper sulfate reacts with the sulfuric acid in the hot effluent thereby neutralizing the bulk of the sulfuric acid and converting the dibasic copper sulfate to cupric sulfate.
