## Properties of Groundwater Lenntech
Properties of groundwater.Composition: The geological nature of the soil determines the chemical composition of the groundwater.Water is constantly in contact with the ground in which it stagnates or circulates,so equilibrium develops between the composition of the soil and that of the water: i.e.water that circulates in a sandy or granitic substratum is acidic and has a few minerals.What Are the Properties of Limestone? ReferenceLimestone has low porosity it is weather resistant and has a density of between 2.5 and 2.7 kg cm3.It has a hardness of between 3 and 4 on Moh's Scale and a water absorption of less than 1 percent.Limestone is a very compact rock that takes polish very well.
