## How iron is made material,manufacture,making,history
The raw materials used to produce pig iron in a blast furnace are iron ore,coke,sinter,and limestone.Iron ores are mainly iron oxides and include magnetite,hematite,limonite,and many other rocks.The iron content of these ores ranges from 70% down to 20% or less.Sintering metallurgy BritannicaSintering,the welding together of small particles of metal by applying heat below the melting point.The process may be used in steel manufacturing—to form complex shapes,to produce alloys,or to work in metals with very high melting points.In a steelsintering plant a bed of powdered iron ore,

## Blast furnace Wikipedia
The primary advantage of the early blast furnace was in large scale production and making iron implements more readily available to peasants.Cast iron is more brittle than wrought iron or steel,which required additional fining and then cementation or cofusion to produce,but for menial activities such as farming it sufficed.Sinter Plant Process blastfurnacesSinter plant process pdf WordPress.Learn more &#187 sinter plant process pdf 31 Schematic of Sinter Plant Emission Points and Typical Controls.A.Sintering at Integrated Iron and Steel Plants.sinter plant process video

Jan 01,2012&nbsp&#0183&#32It can be noted that the major share (72%) of energy is required during iron making which includes coke making (12%),iron ore sintering (6%),and blast furnaces (54%).The steel making needs very little share (4%) as the process is exothermic in nature.The thermal energy used in power generation and hot rolling account for 8% and 11%Ore Sintering an overview ScienceDirect TopicsThe sintering process begins with the preparation of a sinter mixture consisting of iron ore fines,fluxes,solid fuel (called bonding agents in Japan) such as coke breeze,and return fines from the sinter plant and blast furnace as well as recycled ferruginous materials from downstream iron
