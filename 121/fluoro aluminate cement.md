## Characterization of modified calciumsilie cements
The calcium fluoroaluminate cement showed calcium hydroxide deposits at 7 days but not in the specimens aged for longer periods of time.This calcium hydroxide was depleted by further reaction of the aluminate phase to the calcium hydroxide to produce more ettringite.The deposition of ettringite was evident in all the specimens tested.Lime Patents and Patent Appliions (Class 106 792Search for Lime Patents and Patent Appliions (Class 106 792) Filed with the USPTO

The fluoroaluminate cements were developed by the American researchers of the Cement Portland Association in the early nineteenseventies (Italian Patents No.865436 and No.988018).Subsequently,similar cementitious compositions were developed in Japan and sold as Jet Cement.Highperformance concretes from calcium aluminate cementsCalcium aluminate cements are considerably more expensive than Portland cements (around four to five times as expensive) and so do not compete with the latter in any appliion where conventional or highperformance concrete made with Portland cement performs satisfactorily.
