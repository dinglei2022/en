## Dynamic Cone Penetrometer DGSI Durham Geo Soil
The original Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) was developed in 1959 by the late Professor George F.Sowers.The DCP uses a 15 lb (6.8 kg) steel mass falling 20 in (50.8 cm) that strikes the anvil to cause penetration of a 1.5 in (3.8 cm) diameter cone (45&#176 vertex angle) that has been seated in the bottom of a hand augered hole.Investigation of the change in soil fabric during cone201821&ensp&#0183&enspInvestigation of the change in soil fabric during cone penetration with grain size somewhere between clay and sand.The 2.3 Test setup and equipment Three cone penetration tests were carried out as summarized in Table 1.For each test,the soil sample was built
