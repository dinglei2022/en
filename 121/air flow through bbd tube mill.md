Many things contribute to the cfm flowing through a tube.The main numbers that contribute are the size of the tube and the pressure of the air.For instance,a 1 4&quot; hole at 20 psi will flow 31.4 cfm of air,while at 100psi it will flow 104 cfm.You should be able to fexplosion in coal mill bbdHot air through the mill besides removing coal moisture,picks up the.BBD 3448.Read more Explosion In Ball Tube Coal Mill Causes Protable Plant.

## Roof Ventilation with Turbine Vents
During warm weather,the air inside your attic heats up.Since warm air rises,it tends to float out of the highest ventilation spaces.As air leaves your attic,more air has to replace it.The conventional wisdom is to put in soffit vents down at the bottom of the roof so the replacement air can enter here and flow up under all the roof sheathing.Calculate expected flow rate through a tube&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;I also need to estimate a flow rate through a tube.This time assuming 100% toluene.I have the density (.87g l) and viscosity (.68cSt) and viscosity inlet and outlet pressures (from a tank with 25psi head pressure into another tank at 12psi),but need help finding the K value and Kr.
