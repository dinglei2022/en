EFFECT OF DESIGN AND THE OPERATING PARAMETERS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF CYCLONE SEPARATOR—A REVIEW.number of different forms of cyclone separator but the most common design used industrially is the reverse flow cyclone.Economy and simplicity in design and construction are theComparison of Plate Separator,Centrifuge and HydrocycloneEnhancement of separator performance through design alterations is possible for all three separator types.When the available space for separation is limited (offshore production) to very limited (down hole separation),a plate separator will not,or cannot,be used.Because of economic reasons the chosen separator type is usually a hydrocyclone.
