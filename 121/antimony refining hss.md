## Extraction of Antimony
The refined metal is then ladled out and cast as &quot star antimony,&quot the surface of the cakes showing a welldefined crystal structure.A method has also been suggested for refining electrolytically using an electrolyte containing antimony trifluoride with about 100 grams of free sulphuric acid and 20 grams of free hydrofluoric acid per litre.Antimony Smelting Mineral Processing &amp MetallurgyThe history of the antimony industry of China dates back to 1897 when the Tai Shing Co.was formed,under contract with the Hunan Bureau of Mines,for the smelting of the ore to crude and in 1908 the Wah Chang Mining &amp Smelting Co.was formed for the smelting and refining of the ore and crude to regulus.

## Arsenic (V) removal from aqueous system using adsorbent
Oct 15,2009&nbsp&#0183&#321.Introduction.Arsenism has become one of the most serious endemic diseases in China in the last decade due to arsenic pollution.It was reported that over 2 million people are exposing to arsenic polluted water and about 10,000 persons were diagnosed as arsenism patients (Sun,2004,Kanel et al.2005).Elevated arsenic concentrations in groundwater are mainly caused by human activitiesAntimony and Tellurium AlloysIn the case of antimony &amp tellurium alloys,the theoretical side only is at present important but it is hoped that the results of this investigation may have some industrial value,at least indirectly,by furnishing one more example for comparison when studying commercial alloys.

## Hydrometallurgy ScienceDirect
Hydrometallurgy involves reacting the ore at low or moderate temperatures with a liquid solvent that will selectively dissolve the valuable metal or metals.Separating the dissolved metals from each other by chemical means,concentrating and purifying the desired metal values,and finally preparing the pure metal,usually in powder form,isAntimony trioxide WikipediaAntimony(III) oxide is an amphoteric oxide,it dissolves in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution to give the metaantimonite NaSbO 2,which can be isolated as the trihydrate.Antimony(III) oxide also dissolves in concentrated mineral acids to give the corresponding salts,which hydrolyzes upon dilution with water.
