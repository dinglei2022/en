## Calculate Cement Sand and Aggregate for Nominal mix,
Following is a simple method used by engineers to calculate cement,sand and aggregate to produce different grade of concrete like M5,M75,M10,M15 and M20 if you don’t want to learn the math involved in the design,you can use the table given at the end of the article to produce different grade of concretePea Gravel Mix Concrete Construction Magazine Concrete,Pea Gravel Mix By,Richard Meininger replied that there is no problem designing a concrete mixture with 3 8 inch maximum size coarse aggregate (pea gravel or crushed stone) using the ACI 211 proportioning procedures for a concrete slab placed by pumping But the concrete will shrink more than a No 57 mixture,so control joints must be at a.
