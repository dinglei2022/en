## flotation process Infoplease
flotation process,in mineral treatment and mining,process for concentrating the metalbearing mineral in an ore.Crude ore is ground to a fine powder and mixed with water,frothing reagents,and collecting reagents.When air is blown through the mixture,mineral particles cling to the bubbles,which rise to form a froth on the surface.Froth flotation circuit design and basic testworkFroth flotation is a very important mineral concentration process that is used to recover a vast array of different minerals containing valuable commodities such as copper,lead,zinc,nickel,molybdenum,tungsten,silver,gold,phosphate and potash.
