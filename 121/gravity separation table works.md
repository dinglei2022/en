## Gravity Separators
Gravity separators are most often used in seed and grain operations.Stones,damaged or unfilled seed and other impurities can easily be removed,increasing the percentage of material that will germinate.The video below shows stones being removed from woodchips.Often they are used in series,when a pure finished product is desired.THEORY AND OPERATION OF THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY …2018 4 4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The two main parts of the gravity separation process are air and table motion.If we understand how these two things work together then we have the basis for good operation.The basic principle of operation of the gravity separator is that it takes ad vantage of the difference in size,shape and specific gravity of particles.
