## Study on working principle and separation
The variablediametered water medium separation bed is a newtype gravity separation equipment.In order to study its separation mechanism,the paper used ANSYS FLOTRAN to simulate the distribution of the flow field so as to obtain the distribution laws of the flowElectrostatic Drum Separators ManufacturersPrinciple and working of Electrostatic Drum Type Separator: The basic working of Electrostatic Drum Type Separator is deflection of electrically charges particles when passed through an electrical field.Separations of this kind bring about clear segregation of particles which are of small particle size.
