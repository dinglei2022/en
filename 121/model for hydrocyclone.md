## Mathematical model of the hydrocyclone based on physics of,
The model equations are solved in a computer code that takes as input the hydrocyclone dimensions and feed slurry characteristics The output of the computer code is the velocity profiles of the fluid and the separation efficiency curve To validate the model,an LDV was used to measure the velocity profiles inside a 75 mm hydrocycloneAnalysis of hydrocyclone performance based on …selection of hydrocyclone in different parts of the site.TSK model generates a crisp output value instead of a fuzzy one.The defuzziﬁer is not

## DATA BASED PERFORMANCE MODELLING OF HYDROCYCLONE,
2 Performance modelling of the hydrocyclone To quantify hydrocyclone operation various attempts have been made to develop theoretical and empirical models Although,a number of investigations have been carried out to study the flow field and dispersed phase particle behaviour in the hydrocyclones,their separation phenomena are still notHydrocyclone Centrifugal Separators VAFHydrocyclone Centrifugal Separators.VAF Hydrocyclone Separators are effective in removing suspended particles from any flow stream of water where.MODEL FLOW.

## Study on design and performance evaluation of hydrocyclone,
hydrocyclones were fabricated with 3mm thick mild steel sheet The clean water pressure drop and the percentage of sand trapped in hydrocyclone were recorded It was found that,the hydrocyclone model M 3 with 26 0 cone angle and 0065m underflow cylinder diameter was the best model with the removal efficiency of 9568% among all the six models
