## Clay Wikipedia
Clay is a finelygrained natural rock or soil material that combines one or more clay minerals with possible traces of quartz (SiO 2),metal oxides (Al 2 O 3,MgO etc.) and organic matter.Geologic clay deposits are mostly composed of phyllosilie minerals containing variable amounts of water trapped in the mineral structure.Extraction of alumina from kaolin by a combination of pyroThe most important factors influencing the extraction of alumina from kaolin is the temperature of the sintering process.The effect of the sintering temperature on the efficiency of the selfdisintegration process and the completeness of the phase transformations,hence the extraction of alumina from kaolin was investigated.

## White Kaolin Clay Skin Benefits Solution for Sensitive Skin
Kaolin clay is also known as China clay,White clay,and Kaolinite clay.The main component of kaolin clay is the mineral kaolinite,which is a layered silie mineral.Kaolin clay is found all over the world,but the name comes from Gaoling,the Kaoling mountains in China,where it was mined for centuries.Sulfurous Acid Leaching of Kaolin for Preparing AluminaThe Bureau of Mines in cooperation with several aluminum producers has evaluated several processes for recovering alumina from domestic resources.The major processes studied were hydrochloric acid,nitric acid and sulfurous acid leaching of kaolin,and the limesinter process to treat anorthosite.

## Extraction of rubidium from kaolin clay waste: Process
The effect of mass ratio of chlorinating agent to kaolin clay waste was investigated at roasting time 1 h and temperature 900 &#176C.The XRD pattern of the kaolin clay waste,CaCl 2 and NaCl with the mass ratios of 1:0.3:0.2 is shown in Fig.6 and leaching results of samples are shown in Table 5.Processing Clay the Easy Way: Water ExtractionThe method I prefer,and teach,is the Water Extraction Method.The big benefit of this method is that usable clay can be extracted from the most marginal of soils.The clay shown below was processed from soil that was almost 70 percent sand and,using other methods,would have been considered unusable.
