Stage 3: Roasting At this stage of the process,the chemical reactions begin.They convert the copper minerals into copper metal.We can illustrate the types of process using the example of chalcopyrite CuFeS 2.From the formula,it is clear that iron and sulfur have to be removed in order to produce copper.Copper Sulfide an overview ScienceDirect TopicsAll copper sulfides require the presence of Fe 3+ and O 2 as oxidizing agents for leaching to occur The copper sulfide is oxidized by Fe 3+The resulting Fe 2+ is reoxidized to Fe 3+ by O 2The Fe(II) Fe(III) redox couple acts in a catalytic manner in these reactions (shown for elevated temperature reaction conditions where the sulfur containing product is sulfate,rather than the,

## Quality of copper concentrate impacts smelter emissions,
Nov 18,2021&#0183;&#32;Copper concentrate quality drivers CRU data shows that the average copper concentrate grade has declined by 7% since 2007 (from ~27% to ~25% Cu content) The grade of the concentrate is primarily driven by the mineralogy of the copper deposit,as well as the success rate (recovery) of metal during beneficiationOVERVIEW OF PGM PROCESSING Anglo American PlatinumHigh grade concentrate requirement PGM Cu grade way too low

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores,
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 9999% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday useThe most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,
