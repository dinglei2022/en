## Thermal power station Wikipedia
A thermal power station is a power station in which heat energy is converted to electric power.In most of the places in the world the turbine is steamdriven.Water is heated,turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator.After it passes through the turbine,the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated this is known as a Rankine cycle.Ppt for power plant SlideShareDec 29,2013&#0183;&#32;UNIT 1 THERMAL POWER PLANT 3 THERMAL POWER PLANT 4 TURBINE 5 Cross section view of turbines 6 COOLING TOWERS 7 Working block diagram of thermal power plant 8 UNIT 2 HYDRO ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS 9 Pelton Wheels Suited for high head,low flow sit The largest units can be up to 200 MW
