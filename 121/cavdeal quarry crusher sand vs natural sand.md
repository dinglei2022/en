## Crushed rock sand An economical and ecological
The study investigates the use of crushed rock sand as viable alternative to Natural River sand that is being conventionally used as fine aggregate in cement concrete.Various mix designs were developed for different grades of concrete based on IS,ACI and British codes using Natural River sand and crushed rock sand.Use of Quarry Dust to Replace Sand in Concrete Annatural river sand has become scarce and very costly.Hence we are forced to think of alternative materials.The Quarry dust may be used in the place of river sand fully or partly.A comparatively good strength is expected when sand is replaced partially or fully with or without concrete admixtures.
