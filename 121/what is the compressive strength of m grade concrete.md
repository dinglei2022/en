## Concrete Grade Types Hunker
A standard 3,000 psi concrete is equivalent to roughly 20 MPa.Some countries also define concrete types by compressive strength,using a standard nomenclature not found in the U.S.In India,for example,concrete grades are rated using the letter M,followed by a number,where the number represents the compressive strength in MPa.High Strength Concrete of M60 Grade for Highway2017330&ensp&#0183&enspHigh Strength Concrete of M60 Grade for Highway Pavements for Heavy Vehicles Sanjay Srivastava*,of high strength high performance concrete mix of M60 grade.material ratio,six cubes for compressive strength,six beams for flexural strength and three cylinders for modulus of elasticity were prepared.Finally water cementitious material
