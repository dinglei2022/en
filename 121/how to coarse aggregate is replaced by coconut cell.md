## Construction aggregate Wikipedia
Construction aggregate,or simply "aggregate",is a broad category of coarse to medium grained particulate material used in construction,including sand,gravel,crushed stone,slag,recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregat Aggregates are the most mined materials in the worldPerformance of Coconut Shell as Coarse Aggregate in,(2009) replaced the coarse aggregate by coconut shell and grained palm kernel in their study Percentage of replacement by coconut shell were 0%,25%,50%,75% and 100% respectively Conclusion is that the combination of these materials has potential of being used as lightweight aggregate in concrete and also has reduce the.
