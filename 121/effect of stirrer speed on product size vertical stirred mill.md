## DEM simulation and analysis of operating parameters on
Stirred media mills have been increasingly used in ultrafine grinding.The VXPmill is a vertical high speed stirred media mill for grinding mineral ores with high efficiency.Since it is a new technology in the industry,there is little understanding on the breakage kinetics of the mill.In order to gain more knowledge about the VXPmill,computer modelling of the mill was performedA Comparative study on a vertical stirred mill agitatorIt is evident that grinding in a vertical stirred mill with a double helical screw is more efficient than that using a pin type stirrer in terms of the product size distribution and the specific
