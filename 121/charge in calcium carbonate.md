May 15,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32Carbonate ion you mean? Carbonate ion = CO3 2 means carbonate is an anion with a negative 2 charges.The oxidation state or oxidation number of Carbon in CO3 is 4+ The oxidation number of Oxygen in CO3 is 2CO3 = 1C + 3 O = 1(4+) + 3(2) = 4 + 6 = 2.Therefore,the charge on Carbonate ion is 2I apologize for unable to format this better.Calcium carbonate crystallisation at charged graphiteCalcium carbonate crystallisation on surfaces has been studied extensively due to its prominence in biomineralisation,but the role of surface charge in nucleation
