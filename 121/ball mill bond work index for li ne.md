A Bond Ball Mill Work Index may also be used in the simulation and optimisation of existing mill(s) and the associated grinding circuit(s).Sample Requirements: A minimum of 8 kg of material crushed to nominally minus 10 mm is preferred.JKTech would stage crush the sample to minus 3.35 mm,as required for the Bond Ball Mill Work Index test feed.Bond Work Index Formula EquationBond Work Index Tests.Grinding Solutions offers a range of Bond Work Index Testing from crushability and abrasion to ball and rod mills.For more information on the tests please see below: Bond Low Energy Impact Test.The Bond Low Energy Impact test can be used to determine the Crusher Work index (CWi),also known as the Impact Work Index.

Use of Work Index Since its introduction in the 1960s the Bond Ball Mill Work Index (BBMWi) parameter has been extensively used in predicting ball mill power draw.Along with comminution circuit design the work index parameter is widely used in tracking mill performance.Due to the age and lack of controls for the test manyCORRELATION BETWEEN BOND WORK INDEX ANDthe work index depending on the grind size.In this way,work index values are usually obtained for some specific grind size that characterizes the grinding operation to design or under evaluation.This study was carried out in a standard bond ball mill 305 mm x 305 mm size
