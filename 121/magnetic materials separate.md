## Magnetic separators are designed to separate ferrous
Magnetic separators are designed to separate ferrous materials from nonmagnetic materials.The ferrous materials are usually impurities of varying particle size and their extraction either improves the purity level of a bulk product or protects sensitive machinery Separation techniques are also used in metal recycling to sort ferrous from nonferrous material and for conveying cans in canningWhat are some examples of magnetic materials? QuoraDec 08,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32Ferromagnetism,paramagnetism and diamagnetism are the most common ones.Ferromagnetic materials are named after iron,the most wellknown ingredient in electromagnets.A magnetic field is strengthened several thousand times by the presence of a f
