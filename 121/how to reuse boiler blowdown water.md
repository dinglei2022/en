## Boiler Blowdown
To avoid boiler problems,water must be periodically discharged or “blown down” from the boiler to control the concentrations of suspended and total dissolved solids in the boiler.Surface water blowdown is often done continuously to reduce the level of dissolvedWater and Wastewater Treatment Technology UpdateThe handling of power plant water and wastewater is becoming increasingly complex.Fortunately,innovative treatment technologies can help.Recent advances include
