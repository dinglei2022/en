## Froth flotation Wikipedia
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.This is used in mineral processing,paper recycling and wastewater treatment industries.Historically this was first used in the mining industry,where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century.Kinetics of Coal Flotation 911metallurgistHowever,understanding the flotation kinetic behavior of coal,ash and pyrite is important in order to simulate and optimize flotation separation processes.Materials and Methods All coal samples were first crushed to minus &#188 inch and then split into 500gram subsamples and stored in

## Switching and optimizing control for coal flotation
Flotation is an important part of coal preparation,and the flotation column is widely applied as efficient flotation equipment.This process is complex and affected by many factors,with the froth depth and reagent dosage being two of the most important and frequently manipulated variables.This paper proposes a new method of switching and optimizing control for the coal flotation process.The Future for Flotation E &amp MJFlotation has been a mainstay of mineral processing for the best part of a century,and the technology continues to develop.E&ampMJ asked some of the world's suppliers of equipment and reagents for their insights on current and future trends.Flotation is one of the key technologies within the mineral processing alogue.

## Optimisation of operating variables of fine coal flotation
An attempt has been made in this paper to optimize the batch laboratory froth flotation parameters of fine coal using the above two concepts,i.e.kmod and SI and statistical techniques.A flotation bank containing four Outukumpu cells was optimized using the results obtained from the lab study.International Journal of Coal Preparation and UtilizationABSTRACTThe focus of this research is to explore the relationship between the response functions (ash content and flotation perfect index [FPI]) and variables (collector dosage,frother dosage,and stirring speed).The Box Behnken experimental design and response surface methodology were applied for modeling the influence of some variables on the performance of coal flotation.
