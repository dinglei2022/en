## Preconcentration Gekko
Physical separation processes,including blasting techniques,ore sorting,screening,magnetic separation,gravity separation,jigs,may be employed as preconcentration techniques.Depending on the mineral and specific characteristics of the ore body,a tailored preconcentration flowsheet may use several devices to prepare the preconcentrateManganese Ore Magnetic Separator jig,jigger,jigGravity separation and magnetic separation can be involved for manganese upgrading.Gravity separation is more commonly used in manganese beneficiation with its low plant investment and low operation cost.However for some manganese ore of too fine inlay or small density difference between manganese and its attached gangue,gravity separation can not work,magnetic separation or

Magnetic separation separates according to the magnetic force and gravity force.The magnetic force is up to magnetic ore itself and the magnetic field while the nonmagnetism material is mainly affected by mechanical force.Both materials move along different routes.Jig,Jigging Machine,Jigger Machine XinhaiA tungsten ore dressing plant in Jiangxi is loed in the mountains,the workshop area is small,the requirement for jig is much more strict in gravity separation process,according to the hierarchy law of the jigging bed theory,Xinhai developed and researched based on traditional jigging machine,the separating medium adopted digital

## EFFECTIVE PROCESSING OF LOWGRADE IRON ORE
in specific gravity and magnetic susceptibility between the desired iron minerals and the gangue minerals,it was suggested that gravity separation and or magnetic separation may be useful to concentrate this type of ore.These two techniques were adopted for the beneficiation of the Wadi Halfa lowgrade iron ore.Jig concentrators WikipediaJig concentrators are devices used mainly in the mining industry for mineral processing,to separate particles within the ore body,based on their specific gravity (relative density).The particles would usually be of a similar size,often crushed and screened prior to being fed over the jig bed.There are many variations in design however the basic principles are constant: The particles are
