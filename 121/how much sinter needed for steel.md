## Sinter plant Wikipedia
Sinter plants agglomerate iron ore fines (dust) with other fine materials at high temperature,to create a product that can be used in a blast furnaceThe final product,a sinter,is a small,irregular nodule of iron mixed with small amounts of other minerals The process,called sintering,causes the constituent materials to fuse to make a single,Pressing And Sintering Of Powder PartsPressing and sintering are the mechanisms used to form solid parts from powders Pressing occurs first,then sintering,Amount of powder needed will be based on the bulk density of the powder and the amount of material in the final part,Vacuum sintering is mainly applicable to refractory metals and stainless steel Sintering of a,
