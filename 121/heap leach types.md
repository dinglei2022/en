## Heap Leaching an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Both types of leaching are used extensively for mining waste and lean copper ore.The process has a long history,with origins at least in the 17th century in Rio Tinto in Spain (Table 1.2).Heap leaching was realised considerably later for efficient extraction of uranium and gold.types of equipments of leaching and process of leachingTypes of Leaching Underground insitu leaching [image] Heap leaching [image] Tank leaching [image] Pressure leaching [image] Heap Leaching.Heap leaching is a simple,lowcost method of recovering precious metals from lowgrade ores.Ore is stacked in heaps over an impermeable leachingpad.Leach

Several research groups have spent considerable time investigating coarse ore leaching.Coarse ore leaching includes both heap and dump leaching.The terra "heap leaching" will be used in this paper to mean any type of coarse ore leaching.The results of their work are generally in agreement: the progress of leaching can be described by the shrinking core model and its associated mathematics.HEAP LEACHING OF MindoroFor all three types of mineralization heap leaching tests were completed at two crush sizes of minus 12.7mm and minus 50mm.Complimentary to these were agitation leach tests at a grind size of 80% passing 75&#181m to indie the maximum gold extractions that might be achieved from each type of mineralization.
