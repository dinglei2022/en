## how a jaw crusher works and what it is used for
A fixed jaw,mounted in a &quot;V&quot; alignment is the stationary breaking surface,while the movable jaw exerts force on the rock by forcing it against the stationary plate.The space at the bottom of the &quot;V&quot; aligned jaw plates is the crusher product size gap,or the size of the crushed product from the jaw crusher.Jaw CrushersJaw Crusher technology RETSCH Jaw Crushers are robust and powerful forced feed crushers.The feed material passes through the no rebound hopper and enters the crushing chamber.Size reduction takes place in the wedgeshaped area between the fixed crushing arm and one moved by an

## Crusher
Gyratory crushers are principally used in surface crushing plants.The gyratory crusher (Figure 6.5) consists essentially of a long spindle,carrying a hard steel conical grinding element,the head,seated in an eccentric sleeve.The spindle is suspended from a “spider” and,as it rotates,normally between 85 and 150 rpm,it sweeps out a conical path within the fixed cru
