Dimeric silicon dioxide,(SiO 2) 2 has been prepared by reacting O 2 with matrix isolated dimeric silicon monoxide,(Si 2 O 2).In dimeric silicon dioxide there are two oxygen atoms bridging between the silicon atoms with an SiOSi angle of 94&#176 and bond length of 164.6 pm and the terminal SiO bond length is 150.2 pm.Silicate WikipediaIn geology and astronomy,the term silicate is used to mean silicate minerals,ionic solids with silicate anions; as well as rock types that consist predominantly of such minerals In that context,the term also includes the non ionic compound silicon dioxide SiO 2 (silica,quartz),which would correspond to x = 2 in the general formula
