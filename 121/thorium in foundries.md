## India Slashes Plans for New Nuclear Reactors by Two Thirds,
India has large deposits of thorium,but has not built and operate a commercial thorium fueled reactor for power generation A fast breeder reactor using U233 thorium is being developed at Kalpakkam The plant will use plutonium produced in PHWR reactors as well as from PWR reactors to breed U 233 from thoriumMagnesium alloy WikipediaPermanent mold castings are made from the same alloys and have about the same physical properties as sand castings Since the solidification shrinkage of magnesium is about the same as that of aluminium,aluminium molds can often be adapted to make magnesium alloy castings (although it may be necessary to change the gating)
