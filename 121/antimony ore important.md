## Antimony trioxide Wikipedia
It is produced via two routes,revolatilizing of crude antimony(III) oxide and by oxidation of antimony metal.Oxidation of antimony metal dominates in Europe.Several processes for the production of crude antimony(III) oxide or metallic antimony from virgin material.The choice of process depends on the composition of the ore and other factors.What is Antimony Used for Metal ItemsWhat is Antimony Used for Today.Modern uses of Antimony also take advantage of its hardening effect in alloys.It is often alloyed with lead and with tin,and is widely employed for leadacid battery plates,bullets and cable sheathing.You can also find tin antimony solder.
