## Flotation Froth
Froth flotation is a process that selectively separates materials based upon whether they are water repelling (hydrophobic) or have an affinity for water (hydrophilic).Importantly,the word flotation is also used in the literature to describe the process in density separation in which lighter microplastics float to the surface of a salt solution.FlotationDAF (Dissolved air flotation) is a procedure of induced flotation with very fine air bubble or &#171; microbubbles &#187;,40 to 70 microns.Mechanical flotation is a term used in the mineral industry to describe the use of dispersed air to produce bubble that measure 0.2 to 2 mm in diameter.The conditions for the application of the different flotation processes in water treatment are summarized in.
