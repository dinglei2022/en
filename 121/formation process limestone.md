A stalagtite is a mineral formation that forms at the top of a limestone cave.A stalagmite is a mineral formation that rises from the bottom of a limestone cave.Geology Bluff Shelters of the Arkansas OzarksIn addition to bluff shelters,the limestone in the Ozarks also led to the formation of true caves through a different process.There is some overlap between caves and shelters.Sometimes cave entrances resemble bluff shelters,and sometimes the collapse of a cave can form a bluff shelter.

Limestone is a sedimentary rock,which means it was formed from small particles of rock or stone that have been compacted by pressure.Sedimentary rock is important because it often contains fossils and gives clues about what type of rock was on the Earth long ago.Lime Production from Limestone Grade 12U ChemistryMay 06,2013&nbsp&#0183&#32This rain will behave as an acid in the limestone formation process: dissolves the limestone.(H 2 CO 3 (g) + CaCO 3 (s) ↔ 2HCO 3 (aq) + Ca 2+ (s): CO 3 2 acts as a base).In this process,the equilibrium is constantly moving in nature,and this becomes evident with the formation of stalagmites and stalactites within these caves.
