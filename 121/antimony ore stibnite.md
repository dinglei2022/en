## Stibnite: Mineral information,data and localities.
Stibnite is a very soft delie mineral and should be kept in a container with a very soft cushion like cotton and not allowed to rub up against the sides of the box.Stibnite is a bit like graphite in that it will leave a streak when rubbed against paper.Antimony trioxide Wikipedia20191024&ensp&#0183&enspAntimony(III) oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula Sb 2 O 3.It is the most important commercial compound of antimony.It is found in nature as the minerals valentinite and senarmontite.Like most polymeric oxides,Sb 2 O 3 dissolves in aqueous solutions with hydrolysis.
