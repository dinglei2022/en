Magnetite has a black or brownishred color and a black streak.It has a hardness of about 6 on the Mohs hardness scale.It is one of two minerals in the world that is naturally magnetic.Magnetite,also known as lodestone,is found throughout the United States.Magnetite is an important source of iron ore and occurs in many igneous rocks.University of Minnesota’s Mineral Pages: HematiteIlmenite exhibits a black streak similar to that of magnetite,while hematite’s streak is red to reddish brown Graphite,Wisconsin and Michigan held tremendous amounts of hematite,together with other iron ores such as magnetite,goethite and siderite Although these iron ore deposits have been metamorphosed and enriched by groundwater.
