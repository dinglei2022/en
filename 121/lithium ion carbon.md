## The Regulating Role of Carbon Nanotubes and Graphene in
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene,known with many appealing properties,are investigated intensely for improving the performance of lithium‐ion (Li‐ion) and lithium sulfur (Li S) batteries.However,a general and objective understanding of their actual role in Li‐ion and Li S batteries is lacking.Nanobatteries WikipediaCarbon nanostructures have been used to increase the capability of electrodes,namely the hode.In LiSO 2 batteries,carbon nanostructuring was able to theoretically increase the energy density of the battery by 70% from the current lithiumion battery technology.
