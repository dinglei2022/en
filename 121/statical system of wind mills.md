## Introduction to Wind Power North Carolina Wind Energy.
Wind ener gy is a source of renewable power which comes from air current flowing across the earth's surface.Wind turbines harvest this kinetic energy and convert it into usable power which can provide electricity for home,farm,school or business applications on small (residential),medium (community),or large (utility) scales.Vestas&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Vestas Wind Systems,a Danish based company,was founded in 1945 under Peder Hansen.Vestas’ headquarters are currently located in Aarhus,Denmark,but the company also boasts of

## Health Effect of Wind Turbines Science Based Medicine
There is some evidence to suggest that infrasound can have an effect on the vestibular system of sensitive individuals.This,however,has not been directly correlated with the existence of symptoms.One objective question to answer is how loud are wind turbines? This depends on the exact model and,of course,how fast the wind is blowing.How do Wind Turbines work ?&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Working of a wind turbine is illustrated in this video with the help of animation.The topic covered are blade design,use of brake,velocity sensor,yawing m
