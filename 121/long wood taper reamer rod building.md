&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;I was wondering,why not make a bridge end pin that matches a Taper Pin reamer which can be bought very cheaply everywhere,so I wouldn't need to spend $50 60 dollars on a special bridge end pin reamer.Does it really matter what the taper angle of a bridge pin is? Would it be wise if I were to turn bridge pins or end pins to match a taper pin.Easier way to ream cork? Grips and Reel Seats Rod BuildingPage 1 of 3 Easier way to ream cork? posted in Grips and Reel Seats: OK,so far there has not been an issue with reaming cork grips.However,a situation had come up that requires inquiry of the forum members.I mostly build fly rods and spinning rods which have a small diameter blank.My problem is I am working on a rod that has a large diameter blank.

A precision tapered reamer is used to make a tapered hole to later receive a tapered pin.A taper pin is a self tightening device due to the shallow angle of the taper,they may be driven into the tapered hole such that removal can only be done with a hammer and punch.They are sized by a number sequence (for example,a No.4 reamer would use No.4 taper pins).Guidance on how to make the tapered bore on a high …&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Sure seems like I could use a long boring bar and get it very close that way first,otherwise I am not sure how to establish the initial tapered bore otherwise without stepping the bore with different sized drills.How does the reamer even cut anything if the cutting edge is in the same plane as the reamer's taper?
