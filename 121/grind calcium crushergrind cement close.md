## The role of calcium carbonate in cement hydration
Limestone,mainly consisting of calcite,is a permitted additive to Portland cements often up to a 5 wt.% limit.It is shown by experiment and calculation that much,if not all,of this calcite is reactive and affects the distribution of lime,alumina and sulfate and thereby alters the mineralogy of hydrated cement pastes.Cement from CO2: A Concrete Cure for Global Warming,Cement,which is mostly commonly composed of calcium silicates,requires heating limestone and other ingredients to 2,640 degrees F (1,450 degrees C) by burning fossil fuels and is the third.
