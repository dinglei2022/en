## Bond Work Index Procedure and Method
Bond Work Index Procedure Step by Step While performing the test,we go through steps 0,1,2,3,4…….in sequence.Fill the data as needed guided by each step.The Ball Mill Charge: Clean the Ball Mill and accessory equipment before starting.Count and weigh the Balls by sizing group.Record the results on the Ball Count and Charge Weight.Comminution Hazen ResearchBond Ball Mill Grindability: requires 15 kg of minus 6 mesh material: $950 This test determines the Bond Ball Mill Work Index,which can be used with Bond’s Third Theory of Comminution to calculate net power requirements for sizing ball mills The test is a closed circuit,dry grindability test is run in a standard ball mill,and can be.
