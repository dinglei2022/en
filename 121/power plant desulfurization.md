What is flue gas desulfurization? Flue gas desulfurization (FGD) is the technology used for removing sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) from the exhaust (or flue gases) produced by coalfired power plants.A majority of FGD systems have two stages: one for Fly Ash removal and the other for SO 2 removal.Power Plant FGD Wet FGD System DuconDucon has supplied wet FGD systems on over 20,000 megawatts of combined power plant capacity.Ducon FGD systems can achieve over 99% sulfur dioxide removal efficiency.Ducon Flue Gas Desulfurization systems can also recover up to 90% of oxidized mercury in the flue gas.
