That's a lot of nuggets and flakes! Although all of the main 14producing gold states have streams that yield gold "color" or placer gold,almost all of them rely on lode mining for the vast majority of their gold.The exceptions are Oregon and Alaska â€” which is the leading placer goldproducing state.Arizona's Placer Gold Deposits by CountySanta Cruz County is in southcentral Arizona along the Mexican boundary.Both lode and placer gold have been produced,but the placer output has been small.From 1900 through 1959,the county produced about 108,200 ounces of gold,mostly from the Oro Blanco district.From 1942 through 1959 gold production was very low.

## Professor Hausel's Guide to Arizona Lode &amp Placer Gold
May 15,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32As I continue to research my latest project &quotArizona Lode and Placer Gold A Guide for Prospectors" I am amazed at all of the potential gold and silver deposits in Arizona.They are literally everywhere south of the Colorado Plateau province.And if anyone has a nose for finding gold deposits,I believe I'm one of those people.I was harassed endlessly the last year before I retired from theGeology of Gold Mineralization &amp How Gold Deposits are FormedGold is relatively scarce in the earth,but it occurs in many different kinds of rocks and in many different geological environments.Though scarce,gold is concentrated by geologic processes to form commercial deposits of two principal types: lode (primary) deposits and placer (secondary) deposits.

## Prospecting Lode Gold Deposits
Prospecting for lode deposits begins with a search for mineralized outcrops,the key to the existence of which may often be found in mineralized float (pieces of rock from the lode that have been loosened by weathering and washed downhill).Geologists now generally agree that most valuable mineral deposits have a magmatic origin and,therefore,that the most promising areas to prospect are in
