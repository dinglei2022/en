The demand for noble metals is increasing,owing to their excellent chemical and physical properties.In order to meet the demand,the recovery of noble metals with high purity from diverse secondary resources,which contain small amounts of noble metals,is of immense value.In this work,the possibility of the separation of Au(III),Pd(II),Pt(IV),Rh(III),and Ir(IV) by solvent extractionSeparation Process of Gold Concentrate From RocksAqua regia or in Latin is more known as royal water is a chemical solvent all the metals Separation Process of Gold READ MORE &gt&gt&gt Gold Separation

## Liquid liquid extraction Wikipedia
2019101&ensp&#0183&enspLiquid liquid extraction (LLE),also known as solvent extraction and partitioning,is a method to separate compounds or metal complexes,based on their relative solubilities in two different immiscible liquids,usually water (polar) and an organic solvent (nonpolar).There is a net transfer of one or more species from one liquid into another liquid phase,generally from aqueous to organic.
