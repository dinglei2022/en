## Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) and Dissolved Nitrogen
Dissolved Air Nitrogen Flotation is used in appliions where the specific gravity of the solids or contaminants is very close to or less than 1.0.Dissolved air or nitrogen provides the driving force for separation.The gas is dissolved into a liquid (water) under pressure inAir Solubility in Water engineeringtoolboxAir Composition and Molecular Weight Dry air is a mechanical mixture of nitrogen,oxygen,argon and several other gases in minor amounts Air Density at varying pressure and constant temperatures Figures and tables showing changes in air density at pressure varying from 1 to 10 000 bara (14.5 145000 psi) and constant,selected

## Dissolved Air Flotation Systems
Dissolved Air Flotation systems effectively remove TSS,FOG,and other pollutants from wastewater.Conceptually,the DAF process is simple tiny bubbles attach to solid contaminants causing them to float and then sludge is skimmed off the surface of the water but designing a DAF system for a realworld appliion isn't quite as simple.Effects of pH and pulp potential on selective separationflotation,the effects of pH,pulp potential,aeration by nitrogen and air during the Mo Cu flotation were investigated.2.Materials and Methods Through a systematic sampling program,a representative CuMo concentrate sample was collected from the Sungun CuMo concentrate thickener underflow which is
