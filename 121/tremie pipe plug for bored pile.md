Changshu Huanli Industries Co.one of our manufacturing bases in mainland China has been established in 1992,which specialized in the foundation piling tools and equipment research and supply,especially the rotary piling industry.Thanks to the fast development of foundation sector in China,our company has been expanded and has more than 100 staff.New approach for tremie concrete used for deeppanel or bored pile can take 12 hours or longer from start to completion.During this period of time concrete workability criteria must maintain excellent and tolerances in workability are tight.This is particular important for the concrete inside the pile shaft as the fresh concrete rises upwards through the duration of the tremie pour.

A foam rubber plug,usually referred to as a "pig," is placed in the top of the tremie pipe before the hopper is filled with concrete.As concrete enters the tremie pipe,the pig slides down,separating the concrete from the water or slurry.Once the tremie pipe and hopper is full of concrete,lifting the tremie slightly allows the pig toUnderReam Pile Foundations: Objectives and Design SoilADVERTISEMENTS: Underream piles are commonly used in India especially as a solution for structures in black cotton soil regions.Objective and Appliions of UnderReam Pile Foundations: Underreamed pile foundations are bored cast insitu concrete piles with one or more bulbs or underreams.The bulb is formed by enlarging the stem of the pile near the []

## Bored Cast in Situ Concrete Pile,Its Construction and
bored cast in situ pile is a strong choice in the following conditions: If noise prevention to the buildings loed around the construction is mandatory or undesired,then the construction of bored cast in situ pile is the most suitable option.Bored cast in situ pile is ideal as end bearing pile,exclusively when it need to be socketed into rock.What is the function of introducing cement plug beforeIt is a common practice in the construction of bored piles by adding a cement plug before concreting of bored piles takes place.One of the possible explanations is that the cement grout serves as a barrier and protects fresh concrete from being washed away by water inside pile bore.
