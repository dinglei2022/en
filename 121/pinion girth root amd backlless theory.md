## Tooth stress calculation of metal spur and helical gears
In addition,the critical load conditions are considered,and both the toothroot stress and the contact stress under these conditions are determined.2.Analytical method 2.1.Load distribution for spur gears.Consider a pair of meshed spur gears (pinion and gear) with either one or two lines of contact.Evolution of balanced root stress and tribologicalThis is mainly due to the root stress developed in pinion root region which is higher than that of the gear.If this unbalanced root stress is removed,a uniform bending strength between the pinion and gear can be achieved.This design is called as a uniform bending strength design of gears.
