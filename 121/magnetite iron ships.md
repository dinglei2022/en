## Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics
Jun 25,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of ironcontaining ores.The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore,leaving a soft,malleable iron metal.Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (presentday Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BC.How does a magnetic compass work? Explain that StuffOct 08,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32That's why airplanes (plus large ships and some land vehicles) rely on gyrocompasses.Unlike a magnetic compass,which points the same way because of magnetic attraction,a gyrocompass uses a gyroscope â€”a fastspinning wheel,mounted on gimbals,that keeps rotating in the same direction whichever way you turn it.Gyrocompasses are better able

## What Is a Magnetic Compass? Sciencing
Apr 25,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32The magnetic compass is the most wellknown of all instruments used in finding direction.It is the oldest navigational instrument and has been aiding sailors to cross the seas for many centuries.Mariners can use magnetic compasses to fix a ship's position on a chart by using it to take bearings of visibleMagnetism ZephyrusThe first magnets were known as magnetite or lodestone.It is said that a Cretan shepherd called Magnes first noticed lodestone when the irontipped end of his crook was pulled down when he passed a certain rock.The ancient Greek scientist,Archimedes of the &quotEureka!&quot fame is believed to have used lodestone to pull nails from enemy ships
