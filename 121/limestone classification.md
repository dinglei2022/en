## Limestone Sedimentary rocks
Limestone is a very common sedimentary rock consisting of calcium carbonate (more than 50%).It is the most common nonsiliciclastic (sandstone and shale are common siliciclastic rocks) sedimentary rock.Limestones are rocks that are composed of mostly calcium carbonate (minerals calcite or aragonite).Carbonate rocks where the dominant carbonate is dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate) areLimestone WikipediaLimestone is a carbonate sedimentary rock that is often composed of the skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral,foraminifera,and molluscsIts major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite,which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3)A closely related rock is dolomite,which contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite,CaMg(CO 3) 2
