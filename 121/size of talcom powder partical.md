## MESH and MICRON SIZES
Mesh size or mesh number indies both the number of filaments or wires per linear inch of fabric or wire filter cloth and the filament or wire diameter.As mesh number increases,the size of openings decreases.Mesh size is not a precise measurement of particle size because of the sizeMetal Powder Particle Size and Shape HORIBAPowder flow and compaction are determined in part by the particle size distribution and shape properties of the material.Laser diffraction and image analysis are being used to improve product and process performance for many metal powder appliions.

## Talc Wikipedia
Talc is a clay mineral composed of hydrated magnesium silie with the chemical formula Mg 3 Si 4 O 10 (OH) 2.Talc in powdered form,often in combination with corn starch,is widely used as baby powder.This mineral is used as a thickening agent and lubricant,is an ingredient in ceramics,paint and roofing material,and is also one of the main ingredients in many cosmetic products.
