## The Latest Mining Boom? Plants That Eat Metal And Scrub.
Plants that eat metal sound like a biological impossibility.But these hungry little guys exist,sucking tiny bits of toxic metal from the soil.They don't just clean the Earth,either—they can actually mine bits of gold and nickel for use by humans.It's called phytomining,and it's the subject.Biotechnology and the Mine of Tomorrow: Trends in,Phytomining is an application of this process in which hyperaccumulators are grown on a substrate having sufficient metal concentration,and are then harvested and processed to extract the metals Processing involves burning the plants after harvest to create ash from which the metal is recovered by smelting or by application of reagents
