## Questions About Solder to Flex Circuits
Questions About Solder to Flex Circuits What is the best way to solder fine pitch surface mount connectors to a thin flexible circuit? S.S.Expert Panel Responses Using a Vapor Phase will provide an Oxygen free solder environment for best solder joint results.It will also guarantee 0 Deg delta T and provide a controlled ramp rate.What is the RIGHT Soldering Temperature?If you have,you might be wondering the same thing as Jyri.Jyri wrote to me in an email about soldering and asked: "I always wondered what is the right soldering temperature in various situations?" That is a great question.My answer to that is,you have to get the solder joint hot enough to melt the solder.
