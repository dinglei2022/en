## Iron ore Wikipedia
Ores containing very high quantities of hematite or magnetite (greater than about 60% iron) are known as &quotnatural ore&quot or &quotdirect shipping ore" meaning they can be fed directly into ironmaking blast furnaces.Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron,which is one of the main raw materials to make steel—98% of the mined iron ore isMagnetite Beneficiation & Processing Fundamentals,Participants will look at the typical types of iron ore deposits and how each may be processed to achieve a sellable product It will also outline the process routes to treat magnetite and demonstrate the benefits of each type of material Magnetite almost always needs processing to reach a satisfactory grade,therefore a focus of this is.
