## The Extracting of Germanium from Crude Oxide
Since the discovery of germanium in certain American zinc ores,notably that of Joplin,Mo.several procedures have been suggested for the extraction of the germanium.These procedures,however,were simple distillations of the zinc ore with hydrochloric acid carried out in the laboratory on a small scale.The cost of the materials and the character of the reagents required obviously wouldtjj.qinghai.gov.cn2004521&ensp&#0183&enspArsenic Ore,Cobalt Ore,Magnesite Pyrophyllite,Tin Ore,Germanium Ore Zinc Ore,Mica 、、、、、、、 、、、、 、、、
