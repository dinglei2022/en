## Preparation of Alkanes Organic Chemistry Tutorial
Preparation of Alkanes from Unsaturated Hydrocarbons.Unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes and alkynes) react with H 2 in the presence of finely divided alysts such as platinum,palladium or nickel to form alkanes.This process is called hydrogenation.Difference Between Saturated Hydrocarbons and UnsaturatedSaturated hydrocarbons are always an example of alkanes,whereas unsaturated hydrocarbons always have an example of only alkenes and alkynes.Saturated hydrocarbons are very less reactive than the unsaturated hydrocarbons,whereas the unsaturated hydrocarbons are more reactive than the saturated hydrocarbons.

## Why are alkenes and alkynes called unsaturated compounds
Alkenes and alkynes are called unsaturated compounds because the carbon atoms do not have as many hydrogen atoms as they possibly could.A saturated compound contains a chain of carbon atoms joined by single bonds,with hydrogen atoms filling all of the other bonding orbitals of the carbon atoms.16 Uses of Alkynes All Uses ofAlkynes are unsaturated hydrocarbons in which carboncarbon triple bond exists between the two carbon atoms.Unsaturated hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons that possess a double or triple covalent bond between neighboring carbon atoms.Traditionally,alkynes are known as acetylenes,formally referred to as ethyne.All hydrocarbons,inclusive of alkynes,are repellant to water but are likely to []
