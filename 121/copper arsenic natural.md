Copper is a versatile metal used in thousands of everyday products.It oxidizes readily to form a distinctive coating known as patina.The patina gives the Statue of Liberty its characteristic appearance,but the oxidation of copper can also cause undesirable effects under some circumstances.Chemistry of Arsenic (Z=33) Chemistry LibreTextsToday the arsenic remaining in the body can be detected during autopsy so this is not (happily) a very effective way to dispatch people undetected.Since Arsenic is toxic to most organisms,it is praised as an herbicide,and pesticide.For example,copper arsenate,(Cu 3(AsO 4) 2),mixed with chromium is a pesticide used to treat wood.
