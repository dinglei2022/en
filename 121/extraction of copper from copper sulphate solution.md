## Copper extraction
This KS3 education resource looks at copper mining,extraction and pyroprocessing of sulfide ores.Processing Stages Stage 1: Crushing and grinding The ore from the mine contains about 2% copper.To get at the copper the first stage is crushing in hugeCopper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper OresCopper processing is a complied process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called hodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different
