## Gold vs.Pyrite.The Difference Between Gold and Iron Pyrite
The most obvious way to tell the difference between them is the specific gravity.When panning out material,gold will settle and concentrate in the bottom of the pan,but pyrite will move freely in the pan.You will often see them at the surface mixed in with the lighter sands and gravels.Recovery of Gold In Pyrite Ores Mine Engineer.Com provides.Sulfide ores,and pyrites in particular,have caused and continue to cause difficulty in.Gravity concentration tends to recover the pyrite with the gold,and only.
