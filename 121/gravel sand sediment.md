A bar in a river is an elevated region of sediment (such as sand or gravel) that has been deposited by the flow.Types of bars include midchannel bars (also called braid bars,and common in braided rivers),point bars (common in meandering rivers),and mouth bars (common in river deltas).The loions of bars are determined by the geometry of the river and the flow through it.Sand and Gravel Overlay for Control of Mercury in SedimentsSAND AND GRAVEL OVERLAY FOR CONTROL OF MERCURY IN SEDIMENTS by Leonard H.Bongers and Mohammed N.Khattak Research Insitute for Advanced Studies (RIAS) Martin Marietta Corporation 1450 South Rolling Road Baltimore,Maryland 21227 for the Office of Research and Monitoring ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY Project Code #16080 HVA Contract #6801

## SEDIMENTATION OF SAND AND MUD IN RESERVOIRS IN
Basically,all sediment (gravel,sand and mud) transported to a reservoir by a river is derived from erosion of the land surface.When the river flow enters a reservoir,its velocity and hence transport capacity are reduced and the sediment load is deposited in the reservoir (see Figure 1.1).Building a National Offshore Sand Inventory BOEMBuilding a National Offshore Sand Inventory MMIS shows sand resources offshore Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) sand and gravel resources are vital sources of material for the construction of coastal protection and restoration projects,including efforts to protect coastal communities,national defense facilities,and federal and state infrastructure.

## Grain size Wikipedia
Grain size (or particle size) is the diameter of individual grains of sediment,or the lithified particles in clastic rocks.The term may also be applied to other granular materials.This is different from the crystallite size,which refers to the size of a single crystal inside a particle or grain.A single grain can be composed of several crystals.4.Sampling procedures and equipmentsieve analysis.Areal samples are suitable for gravel sediment that contains a relatively large amount of sand and fine gravel,because areal samples,which focus on a small sampling area,are capable of including these fines,whereas pebble counts and grid counts tend to neglect them.
