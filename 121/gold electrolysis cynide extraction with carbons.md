## What's the CIP gold extraction process? Quora
CIP stands for 'carboninpulp' where finely ground gold ore mixed with a solution of sodium cyanide in water is agitated in tanks.In the presence of oxygen,the particles of gold form a complex with the cyanide.The pulp is then transferred to lCyanide Leaching Of Gold Mine Engineer.ComOnce the gold has been dissolved in the cyanide,and the ore body has been reasonably depleted of its gold,there are two main processes for recovering the gold from the pregnant cyanide solution.One is the MerrillCrowe zinc precipitation process and the other is the adsorption of the gold onto activated carbon.
