## Identifiion of hard coal surface structure using polar
Hard coal is a very complex substance containing copolymer matter which is partially rigid and partially elastic.This problem is further complied by functional groups present on the surface (Hao et al.2013).Such a structural composition creates difficulties in modeling sorption phenomena and the identifiion of coal structure.Anthracite Coal Hickman,Williams &amp CompanyAnthracite Coal is a hard,compact coal that has a submetallic luster.It also contains the highest level of fixed carbon,the lowest level of impurities,and the highest energy density among all types of coal except graphite.These properties help make it suitable for many metallurgical appliions.
