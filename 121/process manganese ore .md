## Hydrometallurgical Processing of Manganese Ores: A Review
The production of manganese alloy from manganese ore is an energy intensive process and therefore,apart from manganese ore,power plays an important role in the production of ese alloy.There are basically two mangan processes for the manufacturing of the alloy using either one of high,medium or low grade ore,viz Blast furManganese Mining and Processing: Everything you Need to KnowChemical studies of manganese during the 16th through 19th centuries led to the realization that the addition of manganese to iron orebased steel made it even harder.In today's world,manganese is often used for hodic shielding in the battery industry.The Basics of Manganese

## Reductive Acid Leaching of Low Grade Manganese Ores
Our study emphasizes on the leaching of low grade manganese ores with minimal concentrations of both the organic acids.Acid produced by the biological species are of 0.5 M to 1M concentration and shows better lea ching capacity without any hazardous effect,therefore the acid concentration levels were taken as per the natu ral concentration.Manganese Price 2019 [Updated Daily] MetalaryThe modern name "manganese" was derived from the 16 th century name for manganese dioxide,manganesum.The pigments from several colored manganese oxides,such as manganese dioxide,have been used by men since the Stone Age,as is the case in the Gargas cave paintings.These have been dated as 24,000 to 30,000 years old.
