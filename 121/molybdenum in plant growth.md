Nutrients are an essential part of healthy plant growth.For a plant to grow,it requires the correct temperature and humidity,moisture,light,air,certain mineral salts (nutrients) and the absence of pathogens (disease causing organisms).Plant nutrition is the science which studies what plants eat,or more to the point which nutrients the plant takes from its surroundings,in what amounts.The Role of Molybdenum in Agricultural Plant Production NCBI NIHBackground The importance of molybdenum for plant growth is disproportionate with respect to the absolute amounts required by most plants.Apart from Cu,Mo is the least abundant essential micronutrient found in most plant tissues and is often set as the base from which all other nutrients are compared and measured.

Without sufficient molybdenum plants accumulate nitrate in their leaves,but cannot use it to make proteins for normal growth.The plant becomes stunted and the leaves show symptoms of nitrogen deficiency,appearing pale green or yellowish green in colour between the veins (figure 1).The iron and molybdenum use efficiencies of plant growth.SUMMARY.Iron has many catalytic roles in photosynthesis,respiration and nitrogen assimilation; molybdenum is involved in NO 3 and (usually) N 2 reduction.This paper concentrates on computing the efficiency of use of Fe and Mo in growth of organisms growing with different mixtures of the major resources photons,carbon and nitrogen.
