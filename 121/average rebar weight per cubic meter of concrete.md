## For one meter cube of concrete how much kg steel is
For one meter cube of concrete how much kg steel is its depend on dia of bar used in concrete for example the weight of 50 to 60kg per cubic meterHow many kg of steel reinforcement in one cubic meter.It all depends on the type and sizes of the steel used.It also depends on the load that the concrete has to take at certain points.7865kg is the weight of a cubic meter of steel.Typical.

## Calculate Quantities of Materials for Concrete Cement.
This method of calculation for quantities of materials for concrete takes into account the mix proportions from design mix or nominal mixes for structural strength and durability requirement.Now we will learn the material calculation by an example.Calculating Quantities of Materials for per cubic meter or cubic feet or cubic yards concreteHow much does reinforced concrete weigh per cubic yard.Normal weight concrete a mixture or sand,cement,and stone gravel has an accepted density of 145 pounds per cubic foot.Since there are 27 cubic feet per cubic yard,a cu.yd.weighs 3915.
