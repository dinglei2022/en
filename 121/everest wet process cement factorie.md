## Industrial process such as grinding crushing
Spherical graphite grinding system: The spheroidization process is the most important step for making cathode &amp; anode materials.Prominer has the ability to provide the complete spherical graphite grinding system including primary crushing mill,shaping mill,air classifier and dedusting system.Dry Process for Manufacturing of Cement ,In dry and semi dry processes for manufacturing of cement,the raw materials are crushed and fed in the correct proportions into a grinding mill,of coal in this method is only about 100 kg when compared to the requirement of about 220 kg for producing a ton of cement in the wet process
