## (PDF) Greater mycorrhizal colonization of unisexual morphs,
Different sexual morphs of dimorphic and trimorphic populations of plants have different demands for resources correlating with phenotypic and ecological dissimilarities among morphsTrimorphic stepping stones pave the way to fungal virulenceJan 13,2009&#0183;&#32;As a result,the trimorphic species C albicans is a successful commensal and pathogen,whereas the dimorphic yeast S cerevisiae is an uncommon pathogen Exploring genetic circuits controlling dimorphism in both species,and those between them,is likely to be illustrative
