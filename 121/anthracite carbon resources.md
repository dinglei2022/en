## Anthracite
Fossil carbon is found in many forms,starting from the youngest: peat,lignite,coal,and anthracite.Oil and natural gas are large carbon resources,too.All of them have been used for coke making,except anthracite and natural gas,but only a relatively few coal grades are considered as good coking coals for metallurgical coke.Wanboda Carbons Carbon Additive,ECA,GCA,Graphitized.Wanboda Group is one of the largest and leading Manufacturer and Supplier of Carbon &amp; Coke products in China.Products including Carbon Additive,Electrically Calcined Anthracite Coal,Calcined Anthracite Coal,Graphitized Petroleum Coke,Metallurgical Coke.

Coal is a combustible black or brownishblack sedimentary rock,formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements chiefly hydrogen,sulfur,oxygen,and nitrogen.Coal is formed if dead plant matter decays into peat and over millions of years the heat and pressure of deep burial converts the peat into coal.Atlantic Carbon GroupAtlantic Carbon Group Plc is a UK based anthracite mining and processing company with its operational HQ at Stockton Mine,Hazleton,Pennsylvania,USA.We are the leading US producer of high quality anthracite coal.
