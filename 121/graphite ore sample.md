## About Graphite Saint Jean Carbon
There are three principal types of natural graphite,each occurring in different types of ore deposit The mineral graphite is an allotrope of carbon.Unlike diamond (another carbon allotrope),graphite is an electrical conductor,making it a semimetal.Graphite is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions.As a result it is used in thermochemistry as the standard state forPRELIMINARY MINERAL PROCESSING R.K ON THE GRAPHITE3.2 Processing of Bentinck Ore Three different procedures were used to produce the three graphite products.The procedures are shown schematically in Figures 1,2 and 3 and are described in detail in the Appendix.The procedures involved crushing the ore sample to 6 mesh and splitting the sample into 2 kg charges for subsequent tests involving grinding,flotation and gravity
