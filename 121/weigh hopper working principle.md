## Gravimetric Feeders: The Achilles' Heel of Continuous,
Gravimetric feeders are frequently used in continuous manufacturing process A gravimetric feeder relies on a control system that adjusts the speed of the feeder based on loss in weight measurements Since the controller is unable to discern the discharge rate when its hopper is being filled with new material,two hoppers arranged in series are typically usedHow to Design Efficient and Reliable Feeders for Bulk SolidsHow to Design Efficient and Reliable Feeders for Bulk Solids by John W Carson,PhD and Greg Petro,PE A feeder is an extremely important element in a bulk material handling system,since it is the means by which the rate of solids flow from a bin or hopper is controlled When a feeder stops,solids flow should cease When a
