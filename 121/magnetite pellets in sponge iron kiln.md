## Cold Bonding of Iron Ore Concentrate Pellets: Mineral,
Iron ore concentrate pellets are traditionally hardened at high temperatures in horizontal grates and grate kiln furnac However,heat induration requires tremendous quantities of energy to produce high quality pellets,and is consequently expensive Cold bonding is a low temperature alternative to heat induration Pellets can be cold bonded using lime,cement,sponge iron,iron ore pellets manufacturing process by tunnel kilnIron ore pelletizing SBM Corporation Iron ore pelletizing SBM grate kiln systems Iron ore is upgraded to a higher iron,indurated pellets) moves in a direction opposite to that of the process gas flow.
