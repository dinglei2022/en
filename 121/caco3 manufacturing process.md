## Calcium carbonate Essential Chemical Industry
Calcium carbonate (limestone) is heated to form calcium oxide (quicklime) and carbon dioxide: It is an endothermic reaction and the equilibrium lies far to the left at low temperatur Only at about 1200 K does the partial pressure of carbon dioxide exceed atmospheric pressure and the decomposition proceeds to completion
