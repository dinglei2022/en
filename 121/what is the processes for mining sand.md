## Environmental impact of mining Wikipedia
20191011&ensp&#0183&enspEnvironmental impacts of mining can occur at local,regional,and global scales through direct and indirect mining practices.Impacts can result in erosion,sinkholes,loss of biodiversity,or the contamination of soil,groundwater,and surface water by the chemicals emitted from mining processes.These processes also have an impact on theRiver Sand Mining and Mining Methods SpringerLinkAbstract.Largescale sand extraction from river environment for building constructions is a global phenomenon.Indiscriminate sand mining imposes a series of physical,ecological,and socioenvironmental impacts on the river basins.

In order for mining to be economically feasible,the deposit must be loed relatively close to the surface,typically no more than 50 meters deep.Once mined,oil sands is mixed with water to produce a pumpable slurry that can be gravity separated.Learn more about bitumen production from mined oil sands.Mining equipment,Sand and Gravel equipment,CompactSpecial corrosion and heatresistant hydrocyclones are also available for specific processes.The modular construction of these units,in conical or cylindrical form,facilitates component interchangeability among hydrocyclones of different sizes and materials.Maintenance is simple and convenient,thanks to the hydrocyclone assembly system.
