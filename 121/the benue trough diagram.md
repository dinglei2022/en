## Benue Trough Wikipedia
The Benue Trough is a major geological structure underlying a large part of Nigeria and extending about 1,000 km northeast from the Bight of Benin to Lake Chad It is part of the broader Central African Rift System Location Sketch map of Benue Trough The trough has its southern limit at the northern.Earth Sciences Research Journal Portal de Revistas UNThe deeper sources were most likely due to intra basement basic intrusive bodies underlying the sediment covered marginal areas of the Benue Trough The sedimentary cover in the area was generally low and therefore,
