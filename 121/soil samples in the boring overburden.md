## How does Sonic Drilling work Eijkelkamp SonicSampDrill
Sonic drilling is a soil penetration technique that strongly reduces friction on the drill string and drill bit due to liquefaction,inertia effects and a temporary reduction of porosity of the soil.The combination makes penetrating a large range of soils easy for our Sonic rigs and tooling.Like to discuss how the sonic can accalerate your project?Disturbed Vs Undisturbed Soil Sampling HunkerDisturbed Vs Undisturbed Soil Sampling By Tracy,include using a backhoe to create a test pit where you collect soil from the bucket or using hand augers to collect a sample from a vertical boring You can use drill rigs to collect disturbed samples from great depths Collection tools such as split spoon samplers,Shelby tubes and,
