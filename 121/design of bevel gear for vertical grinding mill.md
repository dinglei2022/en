## A New Gearbox Generation for Vertical Roller Mills
The first gearbox generation for vertical roller mills consisted of two helical gear stages combined with a bevel stage as shown in Fig.3.This concept was used from 50 kW up to 3900 kW.Today,this concept is normally used up to a power of approx.1000 kW,while larger gearboxes are usually designed with aShifting to top gear with specialized designs for coal grinding.16 Jun 2015.Approximately 40 years ago,the power limits for large vertical mills driven with bevel spur gear arrangements were reached.With these limitations on the spur gear&#39;s capabilities,gear suppliers had to innovate on a new gear arrangement to fulfil the increased demands coming from the industry.
