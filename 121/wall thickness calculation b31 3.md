## Pipe &amp its wall thickness calculation SlideShare
Pipe wall thickness calculation •Pipe wall thickness design is for internal pressure.•When calculating pipe wall thickness operating pressure and operating temperature is always multiplied by a factor of 1.5 to get the design parameters.This factor is called safety factor.B31.3 Req'd Thickness ASME (mechanical) Code Issues2002531&ensp&#0183&enspNote that in paragraph 319.3.5,B31.3 says &quotNOMINAL THICKNESSES,and outside diameters of pipe and fittings SHALL be used in flexibility calculateion&quot.So this is different from the wall thickness calculation.This is all covered in the CASTI book,&quotPractical guide to ASME B31.3" by Woods and Baguley.All the above is just my opinion.
