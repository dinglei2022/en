Abstract: An adjustment and suspension system for supporting the mainshaft of a gyratory crusher within a stationary spider hub.The system includes a piston movable within the spider hub to adjust the vertical position of the mainshaft.A stop member positioned within the spider hub controls the maximum vertical movement of the piston within the spider hub.Rock Crushers for Commercial Gold Mining Operations.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The gyratory crusher works on the same principle as the jaw crusher but has a conical head and a concave surface.The crushing chamber is lined with a hardened manganese steel material.The rock crushing is caused by a circular movement in the crushing surface and the materials are progressively crushed until they are of a smaller size that can.
