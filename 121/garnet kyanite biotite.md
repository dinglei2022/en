## Schist Homestead
Certain schists have been derived from finegrained igneous rocks such as basalts and tuffs.Most schists are mica schists,but graphite and chlorite schists are also common.Schists are named for their prominent or perhaps unusual mineral constituents,such as garnet schist,tourmaline schist,glaucophane schist,etc.KyaniteGarnetMica SchistKyaniteGarnetMica Schist: Texture: Foliated Medium to coarsegrained: Composition: Muscovite,Biotite,Quartz,Feldspar,Kyanite,and Garnet: Index Minerals: Kyanite and Garnet: Color: Medium silver gray to whitish: Miscellaneous: Bluegray kyanite blades on some foliation surfaces medium to largesized redbrown garnets: Metamorphic Type

## Index mineral Wikipedia
An index mineral is used in geology to determine the degree of metamorphism a rock has experienced.Depending on the original composition of and the pressure and temperature experienced by the protolith (parent rock),chemical reactions between minerals in the solid state produce new minerals.When an index mineral is found in a metamorphosed rock,it indies the minimum pressure andMetamorphic rocks,minerals,grade,and facies Lucky SciAug 08,2014&nbsp&#0183&#32Metamorphic Grades.Metamorphic grades describe rocks on a relative scale from less altered to more altered.In pelitic (finegrained sedimentary) rocks,the appearance of index minerals indies the degree of alteration.Index minerals are helpful in determining isograds and metamorphic zones.I remember the order of the index minerals with the mnemonic &quotCBGSKS" which I read as
