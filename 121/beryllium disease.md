## About Beryllium Department of Energy
Unless ventilation and other controls are used,small particles and chips of insoluble berylliumcontaining materials break off during machining and other processes and spread through the air in the work area.Inhalation of these tiny particles is the type of exposure that can lead to chronic beryllium disease.Beryllium Disease Pulmonary Disorders Merck ManualsAcute beryllium disease is a chemical pneumonitis causing diffuse parenchymal inflammatory infiltrates and nonspecific intraalveolar edema.Other tissues (eg,skin,conjunctivae) may be affected.Acute beryllium disease is now rare because most industries have reduced exposure levels,but cases were common between 1940 and 1970,and many cases progressed from acute to chronic beryllium disease.

## Beryllium Disease merckmanuals
Beryllium disease differs from other environmental lung diseases in that at low levels of exposure,lung problems seem to occur only in people who are sensitive to beryllium—about 2 to 6% of those who come in contact with it.The disease can occur in such people even with a relatively brief exposure to berylliumBeryllium disease definition of Beryllium disease byIn the 1930s,scientists discovered that beryllium could make fluorescent light bulbs last longer.During the following decade,the hard,grayish metal was identified as the cause of a potentially debilitating,sometimes deadly disease characterized by shortness of breath and inflammation,swelling,and scarring of
