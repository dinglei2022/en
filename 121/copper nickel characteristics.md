## Copper Wikipedia
Copper is sometimes used in decorative art,both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments.Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents,fungicides,and wood preservatives.Copper is essential to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome cCopper WikipediaThe US fivecent coin (currently called a nickel) consists of 75% copper and 25% nickel in homogeneous composition.The alloy of 90% copper and 10% nickel,remarkable for its resistance to corrosion,is used for various objects exposed to seawater,though it is vulnerable to the sulfides sometimes found in polluted harbors and estuaries.
