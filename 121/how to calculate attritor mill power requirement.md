## CALCULATION OF THE POWER DRAW OF DRY …
For all model based methods,a reliable method to calculate mill power draw for a given mill is required for the calculation of power draw.Morrell (1996) proposed a mathematical model for autogenous,semi autogenous and ball mills which is based on the motion of grinding charge inside the mill.He also verified his approach withcenter wet ball mill equipment lebenimhirschen.chBall Mill Design Power Calculation.A wet grinding ball mill in closed circuit is to be fed 100 TPH of a material with a work index of 15 and a size distribution of 80% passing &#188 inch (6350 microns) The required product size distribution is to be 80% passing 100 mesh (149 microns) In order to determine the power requirement,the steps are as
