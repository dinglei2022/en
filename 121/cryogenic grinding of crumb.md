## A Review on Using Crumb Rubber in Reinforcement of Asphalt,
To produce crumb rubber,initially it is important to reduce the size of the tyr There are two techniques to produce crumb rubber: ambient grinding and the cryogenic process In the crumb rubber market,there are three main classes based on particle size: (a) type 1 or grade A: 10 mesh coarse crumb rubber,(b) type 2 or grade B: 14 to 20.CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES FOR CRUMB RUBBER MODIFIED …using one or more combinations of four processes: crackermill,granulator,wet grinding,and or cryogenic process.To control the quality of the CRM,it is necessary to insure that certain chemical properties and the required gradation are provided and that the The.
