## Extraction of Gold,Gold Extraction Process,Gold Ore
Gold CIL (Carbon in Leach) Process is an efficient design of extracting and recovering gold from its ore.By cyaniding and carbon leaching crushed gold ore slurry simultaneously,CIL process lower the gold mining operation cost and increase gold recovery rate to a degree of 99%.Cyanide Leaching Of Gold Mine Engineer.ComGold Cyanide Solution (Leaching Gold With Cyanide) Since the 1890's,cyanide has been used to recover gold from gold bearing ores.And today,over 115 years later,most of the worlds gold is recovered with cyanide playing a large part in the beneficiation of the yellow precious metal.

## cyanide process Infoplease
cyanide process or cyanidation,method for extracting gold from its ore.The ore is first finely ground and may be concentrated by flotation if it contains certain impurities,it may be roasted.It is then mixed with a dilute solution of sodium cyanide (or potassium or calcium cyanide) while air isGold Cyanidation Process Mineral Processing & MetallurgyThe Cyanidation Process or CYANIDE LEACHING is ‘most notably used in the recovery of gold.Safety and environmental concerns are of prime importance in the operation of a cyanidation plant.As we get farther into this type of recovery you will see why.The preparation of the ore for processing is similar to flotation.The ore must be ground.
