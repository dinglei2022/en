## How Cement Is Made
Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains.The cement is now ready for transport to readymix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects.Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement,some kilns in the United States use a wet process.Cement WikipediaA cement plant consumes 3 to 6 GJ of fuel per tonne of clinker produced,depending on the raw materials and the process used.Most cement kilns today use coal and petroleum coke as primary fuels,and to a lesser extent natural gas and fuel oil.
