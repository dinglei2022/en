## WasteWater System: Sludge Thickening Equipment (Options
Sludge Thickening Equipment (Options &amp Design) Let us study some of the options available which are commonly used in the industries' wastewater treatment systems.Gravity Thickening Method relying on gravity principle can be applied to both untreated primary and even waste activated sludge.Difference Between Clarifier and ThickenerThe Difference Between a Clarifier and a Thickener is subtle as they will visually look the same.Fundamentally,thickeners and clarifiers are both used to settle solids which results in the separation of liquids and solids.Thickeners are used to concentrate solids,while clarifiers are used to purify liquids.A thickener will give you a high density underflow while a clarifier will not.

## Thickener
When wastewater is treated,sludge is produced.Ovivo thickeners are designed to continuously produce as thick a sludge as possible.Powered by heavyduty drives,designed to handle the specified torque for 20 years of continuous operation,the sludge is gently mixed by rotating rake arms.gravity thickener Equipment Environmental XPRTPassavant Gravity Thickener offers a particularly economic solution for the mechanical thickening process.The robust,tried and tested gravity thickeners are designed for a maximum pressure of 0.58 psi on the bottom scraper blades which enables sludge thickening of up to 600 g l (80 oz gal),depending on the type of sludge.

## Sludge Thickening Concentration Wastewater Treatment
Oct 10,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Gravity thickener design is very similar to that of primary settling basins.The mechanism of the process is also similar.Due to relatively higher solid content in sludge than that in wastewater,a heavyduty scraper is often called for in sludge gravity thickening in order to move sludge to a hopper from which it is withdrawn and furtherGRAVITY BELT THICKENERS gravity belt thickener operationThe process is simple,the decrease in sludge volume is impressive.Our Gravity Belt Thickeners (GBT) reduce the volume of thin sludges and slurries produced during municipal or industrial wastewater treatment.The principle of the GBT is simple: Sludge is flocculated with polymers,released water drained by gravity through a traveling filter belt.
