## A Study of Efficient Drying Parameters for Bed Dryers
going to focus on fluidized bed dryers.The drying of food has many benefits but it comes at a price.Industrial dryers consume on average about 12% of the total energy used in manufacturing processes.In manufacturing processes where drying is required,the cost of drying can approach 60 70% of the total cost (Hamdullahpur et al.2002).Thus,(Received Novem)4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Fluidized bed drying is a process of contact between the two phases.The solid phase,under fluidization con ditions,assumes a &quot;fluid like&quot; state.When drying air is passed upward through a layer of wet material,as shown in Fig.2,the gas will pass at low flow rates through the fixed bed of particles.As the gas velocity is increased,

Fluidized Bed Dryer Technology.Drying solutions that reduce clumping &amp; improved flow ability.Our Fluid Bed Dryer is a revolutionary solution to the frustrations many processing facilities have for clumping and bridging of treated seed and edibles.The Fluidized Bed Dryer uses a combination of air in motion through a vibrating,tilted table.Principle of Operation for Fluid Bed Processors,Dryers,…To prevent the uppermost layers of fluid bed particles from being pulled into the exhaust stream,the fluid bed exhaust plenum tapers outward,effectively reducing the air velocity by 50 percent.The vibratory motion of the processor also serves to convey the material along a defined pathway for uniform processing on a &quot;first in first out&quot; basis,and to evacuate the fluid bed at the end of.
