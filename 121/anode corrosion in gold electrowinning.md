## 10 Questions Answered About Electrowinning and Electrorefining
Apr 17,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32Electrorefining utilizes anodes comprised of impure metal.When the current is passed through the solution,the anode is corroded into the solution,causing the metal ion to migrate over to be replated onto the hode.In electrowinning,on the other hand,the metal is already dissolved into solution hence the anode is inert.Corrosion of lead anodes in metallic electrowinningThe corrosion of anodes in electrowinning is costly because of their relatively short lifespan,material cost,and their impact on hodic deposit quality.The objective of this thesis was to understand the corrosion behavior of Pb anodes in electrolyte simulating Zn and Ni electrowinning conditions.

## Insoluble anodes for electrowinning zinc and other metals.
This Bureau of Mines investigation was prompted by the need for a stable anode for electrowinning metals,particularly zinc and copper,from acid solutions.The polarization behavior of PbAg (1 pct Ag) anodes in H2SO4 and fluoride solutions was determined as the first step in the development of such an anode.The effect of impurities and additives on theTHE EFFECT OF IMPURITIES AND ADDITIVES ON THE ELECTROWINNING OF ZINC by HARUHISA FUKUBAYASHI,1936A DISSERTATION Presented to the Faculty of Graduate School of the UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI ROLLA In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY in METALLURGICAL ENGINEERING 1972 ~t~
