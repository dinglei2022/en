## Mineral industry of Africa Wikipedia
The mineral industry of Africa is the largest mineral industries in the world.Africa is the second largest continent,with 30 million km&#178 of land,which implies large quantities of resources.For many African countries,mineral exploration and production constitute significant parts of their economies and remain keys to economic growth.Preliminary Assessment of NonFuel Mineral Resources ofMineral resources are materials that are in such form that economic extraction of a commodity is currently or potentially feasible.In this assessment,teams of scientists from the USGS and the AGS compiled information about known mineral deposits and then evaluated the possible occurrence of undiscovered deposits of all types.
