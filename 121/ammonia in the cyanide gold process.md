## Microbial destruction of cyanide wastes in gold mining,
Microbial destruction of cyanide and its related compounds is one of the most important biotechnologies to emerge in the last two decades for treating process and tailings solutions at precious metals mining operations Hundreds of plant and microbial species (bacteria,fungi and algae) can detoxify cyanide quickly to environmentally acceptable levels and into less harmful by products Full.The Safe and Effective Use of Cyanide Society for Mining,Role of Cyanide in Ore Processing A process called “Cyanidation”,or cyanide leaching,has been the dominant gold extraction technology since the 1970s In this process sodium cyanide,in a dilute solution of ranging from 100 ppm to 500 ppm or 001% to 005% cyanide,is used to selectively dissolve gold,

## A kinetic and electrochemical study of the ammonia cyanide,
However it will be shown that under conditions of zero free cyanide,gold does leach readily via the Cu(CN) 3 2− complex It was found that the addition of ammonia had little effect on the leaching of gold by Cu(CN) 3 2−,but did increase the leaching kinetics when the major cyanide species present is,Eliminating Copper from Gold OreOct 11,2015&#0183;&#32;The success of this process will depend largely upon the relatively complete solubility in ammonia of those copper minerals which dissolve in cyanide Chemical reaction of copper minerals and cyanide The Hunt method calls for the direct treatment of the ore with a solution of potassium cyanide to which ammonium hydroxide has been added
