## Calculate cement sand and aggregate Nominal Mix Concrete,
Following is a simple method used by engineers to calculate cement,sand and aggregate to produce different grade of concrete like M5,M75,M10,M15 and M20 if you don’t want to learn the math involved in the design,you can use the table given at the end of the article to produce different grade of concreteTypes of concrete WikipediaUltra high performance concrete is a new type of concrete that is being developed by agencies concerned with infrastructure protection UHPC is characterized by being a steel fibre reinforced cement composite material with compressive strengths in excess,

## composition of m20 grade concrete
Actually,what do we mean by grade of concrete.? Concrete grades are denoted by M10,The composition of light weight concrete is similar to that of conventionalComposition of M10 M20 M25 M30 grades of concrete?The ratios of cement to sand to aggregate for the different grades of concrete are as follows.M10 has a ratio of 1:3:6.M15 has a ratio of 1:2:4.
