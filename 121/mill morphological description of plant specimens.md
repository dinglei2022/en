## Plant morphology
Plant morphology or phytomorphology is the study of the physical form and external structure of plants.This is usually considered distinct from plant anatomy,which is the study of the internal structure of plants,especially at the microscopic level.Plant morphology is useful in the viMorphological Investigation of Genus Ziziphus Mill.The genus Ziziphus Mill.is a member of the Family Rhamnaceae and comprises of ca.170 species distributed in tropical and subtropical regions.The species in the genus are of economic and medicinal importance.This study was conducted to identify the members of the genus in Saudi Arabia as well as morphological features that show delimitation in the genus.
