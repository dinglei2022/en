## 1.7 Lignite Combustion epa.gov
The SOx emissions from lignite combustion are a function of the sulfur content of the lignite and the lignite composition (i.e.sulfur content,heating value,and alkali concentration).The conversion of lignite sulfur to SOx is generally inversely proportional to the concentration of alkali constituents in the lignite.COPPER CATALYZED LOWTEMPERATURECOPPER CATALYZED LOWTEMPERATURE PYROLYSIS AS A to a significant improvement of is observed in the higher heatins value of the heattreated lignite.

## What are the types of coal? USGS.gov
Subbituminous: Subbituminous coal is black in color and dull (not shiny),and has a higher heating value than lignite.Lignite: Lignite coal,aka brown coal,is the lowest grade coal with the least concentration of carbon.Also,there is peat.Peat is not actually coal,but rather the precursor to coal.Calorific Value of Coal A Useful Detail Lignite CoalCalorific Value of Coal A Useful Detail.you just cannot take it off.Calorific Value of Coal.of coal is the heat liberated by.and lignite (brown coal.
