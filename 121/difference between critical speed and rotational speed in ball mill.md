## Which is better,a screw or rack and pinion drive.
Speed There is an appreciable difference in speed between the systems due to gearing.The R&P is geared more aggressively to better utilize the low end torque of stepper motors,and is also more mechanically efficient than Acme screw systems.Because of this,it is capable of much higher top speeds (rapids of 600 IPM+ for some NEMA 23 systems.Understanding CNC Cutting Tool Speeds &amp; FeedsCutting speed (SFM) SFM Also called surface speed or simply speed is the speed difference (relative velocity) between the cutting tool and the surface of the workpiece it is operating on.It is expressed in units of distance along the workpiece surface per unit of time,typic
