## 3 Aggregate Properties
Strength is a measure of the ability of an aggregate particle to stand up to pulling or crushing forces.Elasticity measures the &quotstretch&quot in a particle.High strength and elasticity are desirable in aggregate base and surface courses.These qualities minimize the rate of disi ntegration and maximize the stability of the compacted material.relation between crushing value and strength of aggregatesWhat is the main difference between crushing test and impact Crushing Strength is only compression load is applying this test commonly crushing test helps to determine the aggregate crushing value of coarse aggregates as per IS: 2386.
