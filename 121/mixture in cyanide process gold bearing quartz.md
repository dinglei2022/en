## How gold is made history,used,parts,procedure.
Each process relies on the initial grinding of the gold ore,and more than one process may be used on the same batch of gold ore.Mining 1 In lode or vein deposits,the gold is mixed with another mineral,often quartz,in a vein that has filled a split in the surrounding rocks.Gold is obtained from lode deposits by drilling,blasting,or.Gold in Quartz February 2016 (Vol.85,No.06) ICMJ's.Gold in quartz veins occurs as particles and scales scattered through the quartz,often filling cracks and openings in the vein material.The gold can be such small particles as to be invisible to the naked eye,or as larger aggregates of easy to see blobs,leaves and crystals in cavities in the quartz.The gold fills cracks and spaces in the quartz as the ascending gold bearing solutions.

## Extracting Gold HowStuffWorks
The most common solvent is cyanide,which must be combined with oxygen in a process known as carbon in pulp.As the cyanide and oxygen react chemically,gold in the pulp dissolves.When workers introduce small carbon grains to the tank,the gold adheres to the carbon.Filtering the pulp through screens separates the gold bearing carbon.Copper,Silver and Gold University of DenverCopper,silver and gold are found in elemental or "native" form at the earth's surface.and became an alternative to the ruby glass that was a colloidal suspension of gold.This process was widely used to make signal lenses and similar products in place of the more expensive ruby glass.These deposits originate when gold bearing quartz.
