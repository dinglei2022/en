## Manganese Wikipedia
20 07 2016&#0183;&#32;Manganese is a hard,brittle,silvery white metal derived from the Latin word 'magnes',meaning magnet Originally discovered in 1774,manganese is the fifth most abundant metal present on the Earth’s crustManganese EncyclopediaNinetyfive percent of all manganese ores are used in the production of steel.The element improves the strength and toughness of steel by acting as a scavenger of sulfur,preventing the formation of FeS,which induces brittleness.Biologically,manganese is an important trace element it is essential to the utilization of vitamin B 1.

## SAE AISI Special Carbon Steels chemical composition,
Manganese Manganese increases hardenability in carbon steels but also embrittlement up to about 2%,at which point it becomes extremely brittle This extreme brittleness will remain a characteristic of the steel as you continue to add manganese until you have exceeded 5% when a transformation begins.
