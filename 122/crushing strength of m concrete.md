## Is the crushing strength of M 15 grade concrete 1500 Kn sqm? Quora
M15 stands for a compressive strength of 15 MPa or 15 Megapascals.1 MPa is the same as 1 N mm.So,15 MPa.= 15 N mm.= 15000000 N m.= 15000 kN m.What is the maximum compressive strength achieved with concrete.Taiheiyou Cement Corporation of Japan has recently developed a new cementitious material that is claimed to deliver record compressive strength of 464 N mm&nbsp;.
