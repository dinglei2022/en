## Effect of phosphorus and fluorine on.
Abstract.By means of hydration heat,XRD and SEM,effect of phosphorus and fluorine (P 2 O 5 and F −) in phosphorous slag on hydration process of tricalcium silicate (C 3 S) and tricalcium aluminate (C 3 A) was explored.The results indicated that the early hydration exothermic rate of C 3 S and C 3 A was obviously lowered by P 2 O 5 and F − in phosphorous slag,the second peak occurring.Fluoride Mineralization of Portland cementUpon cooling,the clinker melt re crystallizes to aluminate and ferrite.abundance,CaF2 (e.g.fluorspar) is by far the most widely used fluoride mineralizing.

## Calcium fluoride Wikipedia
Calcium fluoride is the inorganic compound of the elements calcium and fluorine with the formula CaF 2.It is a white insoluble solid.It occurs as the mineral fluorite (also called fluorspar),which is often deeply coloured owing to impurities.World fluorspar resources,market and deposit examples.inclusions,fluorite density may vary from 3.0 to 3.6 g cm3.Fluorite has a melting point of 1418°C.Fluorite comes in a variety of colors: colorless,white,yellow,blue,green,rose,red,brown or nearly black,but the purple variety is most common.Ideally,fluorite contains 51.1% calcium and 48.9% fluorine.

## Fluorite: The mineral fluorite information and pictures
Fluorite is the only mineral for which significant quantities of the important element fluorine can be obtained.Fluorite is also used as a flux in the manufacture of steel and other metals to eliminate impurities.There is a great demand for Fluorite in the optics field,and to meet it synthetic crystals are grown to produce special lenses.Calcium Fluoride AMERICAN ELEMENTSCalcium Fluoride is a water insoluble Calcium source for use in oxygen sensitive applications,such as metal production.Fluoride compounds have diverse applications in current technologies and science,from oil refining and etching to synthetic organic chemistry and the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.
