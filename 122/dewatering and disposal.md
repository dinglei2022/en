## Design Manual Dewatering Municipal Wastewater Sludges
4.2 Sludge Processing Methods Selection Procedures When either evaluating or selecting a dewatering process,the designer must consider both prior treatment processes and subsequent disposal practices.A dewatering process cannot be evaluated without also examining the other processes involved in the overall solids handling system.Wastewater treatment Dewatering BritannicaWastewater treatment Wastewater treatment Dewatering: Digested sewage sludge is usually dewatered before disposal.Dewatered sludge still contains a significant amount of water—often as much as 70 percent—but,even with that moisture content,sludge no longer behaves as a liquid and can be handled as a solid material.Sludgedrying beds provide the simplest method of dewatering.

## Sludge Treatment and Disposal
This report describes various methods of sludge treatment and disposal: it is intended for those charged with the task of determining the fate of sludge,providing them with the information necessary to select among action alternatives.The report has been developed thanks to cooperation between the European Environment Agency (EEA) and theDISPOSAL,REPROCESSING AND REUSE OPTIONS FORis adopted (Vachon et al.1987).Sludge disposal constitutes a significant proportion of the overall treatment costs.Various options available for sludge disposal are reviewed below.Pond disposal Sludge management involves three principle steps,namely solidliquid separation,sludge dewatering and disposal.
