## Hydrocyclones
A hydrocyclone is a device used for the classifiion of sub sieve materials typically below 200 microns.The material (in slurry form) is fed into the feed chamber at pressure,using a centrifugal pump.The centrifugal pump is paired with a cyclone to ensure optimal feed rate for the cyclone to perform efficiently.Cyclone Unit Hydrocyclone SeparatorThe cyclone unit is a device for separating and removing heavy particles of coarse sediment in the sewage.Sometimes used for mud dehydration.Two kinds of pressure type and gravity type,the circular cylinder body structure or metal pipe production.Water pressure or gravity from the upper part of the structure (or metal tube) into the tangent.
