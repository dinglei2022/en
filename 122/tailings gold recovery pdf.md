## Gold Extraction & Recovery Processes
Gold Extraction & Recovery Processes.View Larger Image; Metallurgical Content.Process Development.Gold Recovery.Gold recovery comprises similar stages to the processing of most ores.First,the valuable minerals are separated from the gangue through concentration.The final concentrate is obtained by repeated processing and is smelted.Extraction of Gold from Sands and Slimes Tailings Dump.The recovery is derived from the separation of the gold contained within the sulphides of the tailings material and a dedicated process stream to recover that gold.The sulphides are separated by means of flotation process and that resulting concentrate is subjected to regrind below 25 µm to enable a greater liberation of the gold.
