## What particle size range does ball mill grinding produce,
Answer (1 of 3): Ball mill grinding is one method of crushing ore to an appropriate size fraction Specifically,ore is put into a large receptacle (a drum) and then it rotates slowly around Inside the receptacle,there are balls,usually made of metal,that as the ore is rotated around the re.Particle Size Conversion TableFor example,if the particle size of a material is described as 4 +40 mesh,then 90% or more of the material will pass through a 4 mesh sieve (particles smaller than 4.76 mm) and be retained by a 40 mesh sieve (particles larger than 0.420 mm).If a material is described as 40 mesh,then 90% or more of the material will pass through a 40 mesh.
