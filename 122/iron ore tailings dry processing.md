## Karara Iron Ore TSF design considerations for a unique,
Oct 08,2014&#0183;&#32;Globally,mine operators are becoming increasingly aware of water availability costs and constraints This is leading to a trend of de watering tailings disposal particularly where fresh water is required for processing The Karara Mining Limited operation located in the Mid west of Western Australia selected a large scale dry stack facility for their tailings disposal and storage largely for.Synthesis of magnetite powder from iron ore tailings.1.IntroductionTailings refer to waste material of beneficiation processes.With the increased demand on iron and steel and commensurate processing of iron ore,the proportion of iron ore tailings as solid waste is growing faster.
