Nov 19,2015&nbsp&#0183&#32Copper smelters generally operate as a toll,but they may also sell the metal on behalf of the miner.All the risk (and reward) of fluctuating copper prices falls on the miner's shoulders.The treatment and refining charges are dynamic,and tend to rise when there is a high availability of copper ore.In this way it can be seen that lowerCopper USGS Mineral Resources ProgramEven though the smelting and refining charges are driven by processing cost factors,they may fluctuate significantly according to the market balance for concentrates.Similarly,prices for copper scrap are discounted from the refined value of the recoverable copper content to allow for processing costs and profit.Though the.
