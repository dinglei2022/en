## ANSI Particle Size Conversion Chart Washington Mills
ANSI (American National Standards Institute) Washington Mills has created a particle size conversion chart to assist our customers in selecting the correct grit size based on millimeters,microns,or inches.Selecting Blasting Media for Etching,Cleaning,StrippingIt is important to know the differences in blasting media,since different abrasive blasting media are required for different appliions.Blasting media can be used for purposes such as cleaning,stripping,etching,strengthening and polishing.In addition to the media type,grit or mesh size is another factor to consider for your appliion.

How to understand mesh sizes and microns and how to convert one to the other.What does mesh size mean? Figuring out mesh sizes is simple.All you do is count the number of openings in one inch of screen (in the United States,anyway.) The number of openings is the mesh size.So a 4 mesh screen means there are four little squares across oneScreen Tech International API Data SheetSep 23,2015&nbsp&#0183&#32The procedure tests mesh performance down to a specific micron.That micron # falls into a range of microns.Screen tech International compliant meshes are listed above,along with table 5—pg.40 and 41 of the testing procedure to show the breakdown of API#'s and the range of microns that fall within the API#.

Mesh Vs Micron What is the difference? 25,400 microns = 1 inch So then what does mesh size mean? The way in which to figure out the mesh size of a paint filter is quite simple.If you took the time,all you have to do is count the number of openings in one inch of screen.The total number of openings becomes the mesh size.Understanding Mesh Sizes espimetalsThe designation 325 mesh is simply saying the powder passed through a 325 mesh screen.If you needed a powder that was closer to size you would need to specify two mesh sizes.For example: Tantalum Powder,40+100 Mesh,3N8 Purity.This powder would have particles that were smaller than 40 mesh (420 micron) but larger than 100 Mesh (149 micron).
