The total unit weight is a function of the moisture content of the soil (Table 5 8).Distinctions must be maintained between dry (γ d),saturated (γ sat),and moist or total (γ t) unit weights.The moisture content should therefore be obtained at the same time as the unit weight to allow conversion from total to dry unit weights.Typical ValuesSection 902 AGGREGATES Jboss Home PageSection 902.AGGREGATES 902.01.General Requirements.The Department may re inspect and retest aggregates regardless of inspection at the producing plant.Provide safe access to the material for sampling from haul units or stockpiles.Do not use spent metal casting foundry sand,unless the contract expressly allows for its use.
