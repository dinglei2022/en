## What method is used to separate copper from copper
One method of extracting copper from a solution of its compounds is electrophoresis.An electrode made of copper would be dipped into the solution.Copper sulfate is soluble in water so thatExtraction of Tin and Copper by Acid Leaching of PCBsIt is shown in the diagram that copper is in solution at low pH in the form of the CuNO 3 + ion.For separation of copper and tin,tin must exist as a solid in this region and can be removed by filtration.The copper in the solution can be recovered by cementation from a sulfate bath.2.Materials and Methods 2.1.Dissolution Studies
