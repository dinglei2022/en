## Rcovery of gold in pyritic ores
Sulfide ores,and pyrites in particular,have caused and continue to cause difficulty in recovering the gold values from these ores.In most instances,visible gold can not be seen under microscopic examination of pyrite gold ores.However,if the ore is ground to 200 mesh,most times,a few specs of gold can be visibly seen under microscopic(PDF) The effecT of Iron And oxIdIzIng flux AddITIon onA portion of the pyritic ore was primarily roasted using a rotary kiln to remove sulphur content for the comparison of the results obtained from direct fire assay of the pyritic ore.Then,fire assay process was performed to the roasted ore and gold and silver content in the ore was determined.

was calculated based on the sulfur dioxide exhausted.As copper turned into copper sulfate during sulfation roasting,it is important that how much sulfur removed and remained in the roasted ore.Seen from Figure 1,the transformation ratio of sulfur dioxide enhanced from 75% to 92% when the roasting temperature ranged from 450˚C to 650˚C.Sulphide Gold GekkoSulphide Gold Recovery.Preconcentration of coarse 350 500 micron sulphideassociated gold ore,using the InLine Pressure Jig,is required to reject gangue from the high value material.The IPJ,a classic preconcentration device,is effective in gangue rejection prior to further processing of valuable goldbearing material.

## Sulfur isotopes in sedimenthosted orogenic gold deposits
Because gold is believed to be mostly transported as bisulfide complexes in orogenic deposits (e.g.Groves et al.2003 Goldfarb et al.2005),the source of the sulfur is important to the understanding of the source of Au,the source of the hydrothermal fluids,and the genesis of the deposits.However,the S source of such deposits has been equivocal for many decades.Characteristics and Genesis of Epithermal Gold DepositsTHIS Gold in 2000volume is organized around a classifiion of hypogene gold deposits that emphasizes their tectonic setting and relative time of formation compared to their host rocks and other gold deposit types (e.g.Sawkins,1972,1990 Groves et al.1998 Kerrich et al.2000).The temporal division of orogenic gold deposits into Archean,Proterozoic,and Phanerozoic follows closely the

## The effect of sulphur species on thiosulphate leaching of gold
The effect of three typical sulphur species tetrathionate,trithionate and sulphide on thiosulphate leaching has been investigated in both pure gold and ore systems.The gold dissolution increased at low concentrations of the sulphur species,but decreased at high concentrations.Sulfur Mining &amp Processing: What to Know General KinematicsSulfur mining takes place in countries such as Poland,Russia,Ukraine,United States and Turkmenistan.Ijen,a quiet but active volcano in East Java,Indonesia contains a one kilometer wide crater lake a well known site of sulfur mining.Sulfur miners break off large chunks of sulfur from the crater floor and carry the chunks out in large baskets nearly 3 kilometers to town.
