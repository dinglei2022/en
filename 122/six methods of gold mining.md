## Major Storms and Paystreaks New 49ers Prospecting Club
A lot of gold that was excavated was never recovered.It was washed out of the high streambed deposits,through sluice boxes,and right back into the present rivers and creeks.This was particularly true of hydraulic mining,where an estimated 59% of the gold was missed by many of the large and small operations alike.Placer mining WikipediaA rocker box (or "cradle") is capable of greater volume than a gold pan,however its production is still limited when compared to other methods of placer mining.It is only capable of processing about 3 or 4 yards of gravel a day.It is more portable and requires less infrastructure than a sluice box,being fed not by a sluice but by hand.
