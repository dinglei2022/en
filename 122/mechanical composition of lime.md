## limestone Characteristics,Uses,& Facts Britannica
Limestone has two origins: (1) biogenic precipitation from seawater,the primary agents being lime secreting organisms and foraminifera; and (2) mechanical transport and deposition of preexisting limestones,forming clastic deposits Travertine,tufa,caliche,chalk,sparite,and micrite are all varieties of limestoneStudy on Physical Mechanical Properties and Microstructure,Based on the engineering background in the Jianghuai undulating plain area,this study aims to explore the variation laws of expansive potential,mechanical properties,microstructure,and mineral composition of expansive soil stabilized by fly ash and lime and then to assess the stabilizing effect

## Lime (material) Wikipedia
Production In the lime industry,limestone is a general term for rocks that contain 80% or more of calcium or magnesium carbonate,including marble,chalk,oolite,and marlFurther classification is done by composition as high calcium,argillaceous (clayey),silicious,conglomerate,magnesian,dolomite,and other limeston Uncommon sources of lime include coral,sea shells,calcite and.
