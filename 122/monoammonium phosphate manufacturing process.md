## No.9 Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)
Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP) Monoammonium phosphate (MAP) is a widely used source of P and N.It is made of two constituents common in the fertilizer industry and has the highest P content of any common solid fertilizer.Production The process for manufacturing MAP is relatively simple.In a common method,a one to one ratio of ammonia (NH 3) andPhosphorus Fertilizer Production and TechnologyHistory of Phosphate Fertilizer • Early sources were mostly animal based ̶ bones,guano,manure • Treatment of bones with acid to increase P solubility started early to mid 1800s • Sulfuric acid treatment process of bones and P minerals (apatite) was patented in mid 1800s.• Today most P fertilizer production
