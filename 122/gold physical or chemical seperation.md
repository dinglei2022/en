## Chapter 1,section 3
Every substance has a unique set of properties—characteristics that allow us to recognize it and to distinguish it from other substances.For example,the properties listed in Table 1.3 allow us to distinguish hydrogen,oxygen,and water from one another.The properties of matter can be categorized as physical or chemical.Is filtration a physical or chemical method of separation?Is filtration a physical or chemical method of separation? such as derivatisation.however i think phase changes are still ok for physical separation methods.a mixture of gold dust,iron

## Industrial processes Wikipedia
Industrial processes are procedures involving chemical,physical,electrical or mechanical steps to aid in the manufacturing of an item or items,usually carried out on a very large scale.Industrial processes are the key components of heavy industry.Mineral processing WikipediaGravity separation is one of the oldest technique in mineral processing but has seen a decline in its use since the introduction of methods like flotation,classifiion,magnetic separation and leaching.Gravity separation dates back to at least 3000 BC when Egyptians used the technique for separation of gold.
