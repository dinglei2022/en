Breccia is a clastic sedimentary rock that is composed of large (over two millimeter diameter) angular fragments The spaces between the large fragments can be filled with a matrix of smaller particles or a mineral cement which binds the rock togetherThe Formation of Fossil FuelsThe sediments became sedimentary rocks.Over millions of years,pressure from the rocks changed some of the organic.Compaction happens when sediments.

## What are the steps or processes that lead to sedimentary,
Sedimentary rocks,are made of fragments,whereas metamorphic rocks are from existing rocks Metamorphism requires the partial recrystallisation of the old rock,but in a sedimentary rock there are no crystals,so no recrystallisation takes place
