## Sedimentary rocks
Sedimentary rocks can be divided into two major egories: clastic and precipitated (or chemical).Since the character of the sedimentary rock is largely controlled by the sedimentary environment,they have a story to tell about the climate,the environment,and even who lived at the time they were laid down.Reading the book of sedimentaryCharacteristics of Sedimentary Rocks Rocks GeographyADVERTISEMENTS: The following are the twelve main characteristics of sedimentary rocks.(1) Sedimentary rocks are formed of sediments derived from the older rocks,plant and animal remains and thus these rocks contain fossils of plants and animals.The age of the formation of a given sedimen&#173tary rock may be determined on the basis of the []
