## Zinc ore and mines Minerals and mines Foundations of,
Zinc ore occurs in two types of deposit: as primary zinc ore in thin veins known as rakes,or a secondary deposit formed by weathering of the primary mineral veins Zinc ore is most commonly found as zinc carbonate (ZnCO 3),known as calamine or smithsonite It generally occurs as rounded,crystalline crusts or granular,honeycombed masses that.Ore WikipediaAn ore is a natural occurrence of rock or sediment that contains sufficient minerals with economically important elements,typically metals,that can be economically extracted from the deposit The ores are extracted at a profit from the earth through mining; they are then refined (often via smelting) to extract the valuable element or elements The ore grade,or concentration of an ore.

## Uses of Zinc Supply,Demand,Production,Resources
Sphalerite (zinc sulfide) is the primary ore mineral from which most of the world's zinc is produced,but a number of other minerals that do not contain sulfide contain zinc as a major component Much of the early zinc production was from nonsulfide deposits; however,as these resources were exhausted,production shifted to sulfide depositsIndustrial Minerals,Ores,and Gemsare cinnabar (HgS),an ore of mercury,sphalerite (ZnS),an ore of zinc,or cassiterite (SnO 2),an ore of tin (Mineral) Part A: The table lists several ores of metals and their chemical formulas Identify the metal that each mineral ore is a source of by looking at the formula You can use your ESRT to find the symbol for each element

## Zinc Wikipedia
Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has five stable isotop The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende),a zinc sulfide mineral The largest workable lodes are in Australia,Asia,and the United Stat Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore,roasting,and final extraction using electricity.ZincZinc ore occurs in two types of deposit: as primary zinc ore in thin veins known as rakes,or a secondary deposit formed by weathering of the primary mineral veins.Zinc ore is most commonly found as zinc carbonate (ZnCO 3),known as calamine or smithsonite.
