## About us
IRON ORE MINING Iron ore mining.Virtually every industry is involved with weighing and feeding of some kind.Be it putting the right number of gherkins in a 370 millimetre jar,producing the optimum aluminium for a Formula 1 engine or blending the right material for a complex bridge construction no sector of industry isn’t involved in.MiningMining Mining Underground mining: When any ore body lies a considerable distance below the surface,the amount of waste that has to be removed in order to uncover the ore through surface mining becomes prohibitive,and underground techniques must be considered.Counting against underground mining are the costs,which,for each ton of material mined,are much higher underground than on the.
