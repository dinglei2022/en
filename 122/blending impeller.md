## Products Impeller Marine Propeller: liquid mixing
The Marine Propeller is the most common type of mixing impeller.It is an axial flow impeller,having its design rooting in the marine propulsion industry.Standard Marine Propellers have three blades,but they can be twobladed,fourbladed,or encased by a circular guard.Mixing Impellers by FusionFusion Fluid Equipment offers a wide array of mixing impellers with specific performance characteristics to meet most appliions.All of our impellers come standard in 316 Stainless Steel,but 304 Stainless Steel,Aluminum,and Carbon Steel versions of most impeller styles are available.
