## Utilization of iron ore tailings as fine aggregate in.
In this paper,the possibility of using iron ore tailings to replace natural aggregate to prepare UHPC under two different curing regimes was investigated.It was found that 100% replacement of natural aggregate by the tailings significantly decreased the workability and compressive strength of the material.
