## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics,and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow.capacity calculation of ball millcapacity calculation of ball mill.Ball Mill Design Power Calculation.The basic parameters used in ball mill design (power calculations),rod mill or any tumbling mill sizing are; material to be ground,characteristics,Bond Work Index,bulk density,specific density,desired mill tonnage capacity DTPH,operating % solids or pulp density,feed size as F80 and maximum ‘chunk size’,product.
