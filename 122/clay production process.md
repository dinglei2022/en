## 4 PRIMARY STEPS OF BRICK MANUFACTURING PROCESS ,
The process of brick making 1 Preparation of brick clay or brick earth In this step the soil is excavated in steps and then laid on leveled ground Then the soil is cleaned of impurities such as vegetation matter,stones or pebbles etc After removing impurities it is exposed to weather for few months This is called the process of weatheringTHE USE OF WASTE MATERIAL IN THE MANUFACTURING,this method of production is currently cost effective,the availability of raw material and cost of production are becoming a concern to the industry One of the possible remedies is the use of waste material,having a chemical composition similar to that of natural clay or shale,to replace a percentage of the raw material
