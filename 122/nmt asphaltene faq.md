Jun 11,2012&#0183;&#32;Although asphaltenes are always present in crude oils,they create problems only when they become insoluble in the remainder of the oil A change in asphaltene solubility can occur because of changes in pressure,composition,or temperature Whether asphaltene insolubility constitutes a problem,however,depends primarily on when and where in the oil production,transportation,and,A Novel Way to Treat Asphaltene Deposition Problems FoundRecently a new class of polymeric dispersants was developed that act as asphaltene inhibitors,stabilizing the asphaltenes and preventing flocculation.It is widely believed that these asphaltene inhibitors act in the same manner as the resins and maltenes interacting with the asphaltenes and stabilizing the asphaltene micelles in the crude oil.

## Exfoliation of asphaltenes Baker Hughes Incorporated
Apr 28,2015&#0183;&#32;Exfoliation of asphaltenes United States Patent 9017546 Abstract: A method for decomposing an asphaltene particle includes contacting the asphaltene particle with an intercalating agent; and reacting the intercalating agent to increase a distance between asphaltene molecules in the asphaltene particle to decompose the asphaltene.Asphaltene Deposition Energy & FuelsAlthough asphaltenes are always present in crude oils,they create problems only when they become insoluble in the remainder of the oil A change in asphaltene solubility can occur because of changes in pressure,composition,or temperature Whether asphaltene insolubility constitutes a problem,however,depends primarily on when and where in the oil production,transportation,and processing.

## CA2666956A1 Heating tar sands formations to visbreaking,
A method for treating a tar sands formation is disclosed The method incl udes heating at least a section of a hydrocarbon layer in the formation from a plurality of heaters located in the formation The heat is controlled so that at least a majority of the section reaches an average temperature of be tween 200 &#176;C and 240 &#176;C,which results in visbreaking of at least some hydro carbons in the.Literature Review SummaryResponse Number Oil response at or above that predicted 20 Project performed well (in most cases oil response was near or above expectations) 5 Injectivity is sufficient 2 Gas Production within designed limits 4 Other: minimum asphaltene deposit,cost inline with predictions,lower corrosion than expected,acceptable well failure rate 4
