## Magnetite Vs.Meteorite Sciencing
Magnetite is made up of iron oxide,making it opaque and metallic,much like a meteorite could appear; some other meteorites,however,can be brown or gray.Most meteorites contain an iron and nickel alloy,while terrestrial rocks like magnetite most often doTypes of Iron Ore: Hematite vs.Magnetite INNIron ore is most often found in the forms of hematite and magnetite.Learn what makes those types of iron ore different and make an informed investment.Thanks for both comments.Mr.Newell.
