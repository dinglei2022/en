## Gold cyanidation Wikipedia
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthurForrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from lowgrade ore by converting the gold to a watersoluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction.Vanadium Extraction Process Mineral Processing &amp MetallurgyThe Flowsheet of Vanadium Extraction Process Repulping and Leaching.The accumulated and drained slime tailings are excavated from Ponds No.1 and 2 at the rate of 100 to 150 tons per day on a three shift basis using a front end loader.
