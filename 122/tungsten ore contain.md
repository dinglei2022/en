## TUNGSTEN CARBIDE CAS N&#176;: 12070 12 1 inchemorg
Very fine tungsten carbide can also be obtained by reaction of tungsten ore or scrap with chlorine,followed by gas phase reduction with hydrogen,and carburization: W + 3 Cl2 → WCl6 WCl6+ 3 H2 → W + 6 HCl,Since most cemented carbides contain tungsten carbide,which gives them their extreme hardness and their high specific gravity.Tungsten: Properties,Production,Applications & AlloysTungsten is a dull silver colored metal with the highest melting point of any pure metal Also known as Wolfram,from which the element takes its symbol,W,tungsten is more resistant to fracturing than diamond and is much harder than steel It is the refractory metal's unique properties its.
