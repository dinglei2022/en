ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE A neutronabsorber body for use in burnable poison rods in a nuclear reactor.The body is composed of a matrix of Al2O3 containing B4C,the neutron absorber.Areas of high density polycrystalline Al2O3 particles are predominantly encircled by pores in some of which there are B4C particles.nuclear physics Why is boron so good at neutron2019717&ensp&#0183&enspThe incident neutron will be delocalised and some part of it will almost always overlap the nucleus.What matters is the energy of the reaction: $$ ^{10}text{B} + n rightarrow ^{11}text{B} $$ and the activation energy for the reaction.I'm not sure we understand nuclear structure well enough to give a quantitative answer to this.

The method of detection relies on the absorption of the neutron by an atom with the simultaneous emission of a γray photon,often referred to as an (n,γ) reaction.Since the absorbing material must absorb neutrons and be capable of existing in gaseous form,then the choice of materials is very limited.Physics of Uranium and Nuclear Energy World NuclearOne of these neutrons is needed to sustain the chain reaction at a steady level of controlled criticality on average,the others leak from the core region or are absorbed in nonfission reactions.Neutronabsorbing control rods are used to adjust the power output of a reactor.
