## Uses of coal World Coal Association
Uses of coal.Coal has many important uses worldwide.The most significant uses of coal are in electricity generation,steel production,cement manufacturing and as a liquid fuel.Different types of coal have different uses.Steam coal also known as thermal coal is mainly used in power generation.Coking coal also known as metallurgical coal is mainly used in steel production.Other.Latest Technology of Highly Efficient Coal Fired Thermal.generated in Japan by thermal power plants using fossil fuels such as coal,LNG and petroleum in 2005 was approximately 60% of the total power,so that control of CO2 emissions from thermal power plants is the most important factor for limiting greenhouse effect gas emissions.
