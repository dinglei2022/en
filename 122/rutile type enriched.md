## Rutile Wikipedia
Rutile is a common accessory mineral in hightemperature and highpressure metamorphic rocks and in igneous rocks.Thermodynamically,rutile is the most stable polymorph of TiO 2 at all temperatures,exhibiting lower total free energy than metastable phases of anatase or brookite.Consequently,the transformation of the metastable TiO 2 polymorphs to rutile is irreversible.Rutile and its applications in earth sciences Sedimentology.Jun 12,2010.Rutile may therefore serve as a key mineral in sediment provenance analysis in a thorough study by Papp (2007) has recently revealed that the type.elevated Zr contents if such zircon lamellae rich rutiles are analysed.
