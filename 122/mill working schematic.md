## Colloid Mill: Operating Principles,components,Uses.
Colloid mill is a machine used in the disintegration of solid particles or droplet size of a liquid present in suspension or emulsion.The machine consists of an inlet (which is subjected to a tremendous shearing action that effects a time dispersion of uniform size) and an outlet.How Do Wind Turbines Work? Department of EnergyWind turbines work on a simple principle: instead of using electricity to make wind—like a fan—wind turbines use wind to make electricity.Wind turns the propeller like blades of a turbine around a rotor,which spins a generator,which creates electricity.Wind is a form of so
