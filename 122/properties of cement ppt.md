## What is Concrete and what are the Properties of Concrete
What is Concrete and what are the Properties of Concrete.Concrete is a mixture of portland cement,water,aggregates,and in some cases,admixtures.The cement and water form a paste that hardens and bonds the aggregates together.Concrete is often looked upon as "man made rock".Concrete is the most widely used construction material inThe Science and Engineering of Materials,4th201739&ensp&#0183&enspThe Science and Engineering of Materials,4th ed Donald R.Askeland Pradeep P.Phul&#233 Chapter 17 Construction Materials Objectives of Chapter 17 To present a summary of the material properties of wood,concrete,and asphalt.
