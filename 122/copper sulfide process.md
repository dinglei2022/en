## Copper monosulfide Wikipedia
Copper monosulfide is a chemical compound of copper and sulfurIt occurs in nature as the dark indigo blue mineral covelliteIt is a moderate conductor of electricity A black colloidal precipitate of CuS is formed when hydrogen sulfide,H 2 S,is bubbled through solutions of Cu(II) salts It is one of a number of binary compounds of copper and sulfur (see copper sulfide,Nickel processing BritannicaSulfide deposits are usually mined by underground techniques in a manner similar to copper,although some deposits have been mined using open pits in the early stag The mining of laterites is basically an earth moving operation,with large shovels,draglines,or front end loaders extracting the nickel rich strata and discarding large.

Jul 09,2019&#0183;&#32;Copper Sulfide Ore and Flotation Process July 9,2019 July 9,2019 by [email protected] 1 Types of copper sulfide ore (1) Single copper mineral Its ore characteristic is relatively simple,and the only useful component that can be recycled is copper,Innovations: How Hydrometallurgy and the SX EW Process,To be applicable to this process,the ores must contain copper minerals in sulfide form; as mineral such as Chalcocite (Cu 2 S),Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and Covellite (CuS) In the concentrating operations these minerals are separated from the gangue material of the ore,that might contain as little as 05% copper to form a concentrate.

Groups of 30 32 rats were given single intramuscular injections containing 20 mg of cupric oxide (16 mg copper),cupric sulfide (133 mg copper),and cuprous sulfide (16 mg copper) into the left and the right thigh of each rat All animals were observed for up to 20 months,after which histopathological evaluation was conductedA new way of extracting copper MIT NewsJun 28,2017&#0183;&#32;The MIT researchers found a promising method of forming liquid copper metal and sulfur gas in their cell from an electrolyte composed of barium sulfide,lanthanum sulfide,and copper sulfide,which yields greater than 999 percent pure copper This purity is equivalent to the best current copper production methods

## The cuprex metal extraction process: Recovering copper
The Cuprex™ metal extraction process produces hodegrade copper using a hydrometallurgical process based on chloride leaching of sulfide oreCopper Mining and Extraction: Sulfide OresThe blister copper produced by this process is 99% pure copper The name ‘blister’ copper comes from the fact that this final process produces bubbles of sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper
