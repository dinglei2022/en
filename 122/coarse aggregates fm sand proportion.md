2 天前&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;What Is Fineness Modulus of Sand? Fineness modulus of sand (fine aggregate) is an index number which represents the mean size of the particles in sand.It is calculated by performing sieve analysis with standard sieves.The cumulative percentage retained on each sieve is added and subtracted by 100 gives the value of fineness modulus.Coarse Aggregate: Definition & DensityCoarse aggregates have a wide variety of construction applications because they resemble standard rock particles,as opposed to fine aggregate,which more closely resembles sand.Coarse aggregates.
