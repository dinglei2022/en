## Amazon mining WWF
The Amazon is considered to have great potential for mineral assets,namely copper,tin,nickel,bauxite,manganese,iron ore and gold.As a result,governments are providing tax incentives for large scale projects,in order to boost development.As extractive technologies improve,it is likely that the scale of Amazon mining will increase.Extraction of Resources GeologyMining operations can be grouped into five major categories in terms of their respective resources.These are oil and gas extraction,coal mining,metal ore mining,nonmetallic mineral mining and quarrying,and mining support activities.
