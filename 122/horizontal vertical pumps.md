## Vertical submersible pumps
Two types of installation are often adopted by manufacturers,one is vertical submersible pumps,while the other,horizontal submersible pumps.Vertical submersible pumps,because of their spacesaving shape and simple structure,are widely used under water.Horizontal or Vertical? ekwestrel corpBest Efficiency Point flow.Many,if not most,of these pumps rely upon a combination of both the external bearing support and internal hydrodynamic support of the rotor to prevent rotor to stator contact.There are advantages and disadvantages inherent in either horizontal or vertical pump arrangements.
