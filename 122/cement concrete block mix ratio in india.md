## What Are Concrete Mixing Ratios? Reference
Concrete mixing ratios are the formula for calculating the correct amount of each ingredient used,including water,cement,sand and aggregate,to produce concrete with the properties desired.A basic concrete ratio is one part cement,two parts sand,and three parts gravel,slowly mixingCost per sq ft Concrete Slab in India EstimationTheir is lots of mix,mix refer to the ratio of cement sand and aggregate.As per Indian Standard Code their are lots of predefined mix like M20,M25 etc.Generally for slab we use M20 grade of concrete.Here M refer to Mix and 20 is the 28 days compressive strength in N mm2.which is calculated by Cube testing.M20 =&gt 1:1.5:3

## Cement Wikipedia
A cement is a binder,a substance used for construction that sets,hardens,and adheres to other materials to bind them together.Cement is seldom used on its own,but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry,or with sand and gravel,produces concrete.Cement is the most widely used material in existence and is only behind water asCement Concrete Tiles and Paving Blockscement concrete paving blocks involves the following steps: a) Proportioning b) Mixing c) Compacting d) Curing e) Drying A concrete mix of 1:2:4 (cement: sand: stone chips) by volume may be used for cement concrete paving blocks with water to cement ratio of 0.62.The concrete mix should not be richer than 1:6 by volume of cement to combined
