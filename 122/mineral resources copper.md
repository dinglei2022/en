## Copper Mineral Uses and Properties
Copper is an excellent conductor of electricity.Most copper mined today is used to conduct electricity mostly as wiring.It is also an excellent conductor of heat and is used in cooking utensils,heat sinks,and heat exchangers.Large amounts are also used to make alloys such as brass (copper and zinc) and bronze (copper,tin,and zinc).Rock and Mineral Resources GeologyCommonly,copper is either formed within sedimentary rocks,or associated with igneous rocks.The world's major copper deposits are formed within the granitic porphyry copper style.Copper is enriched by processes during crystallisation of the granite and forms as chalcopyrite—a sulfide mineral,which is carried up with the granite.
