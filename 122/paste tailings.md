## Tailings IPFS
Paste tailings.Paste tailings is a modifiion to the conventional methods of disposal of tailings (pond storage).A conventional tailings slurry has a low %solids and a relatively high water content (normally ranging from 20% to 60% solids for most hard rock mining) and when deposited into the tailings pond the solids and liquids separate.Tailings Solutions for the Future Weir GroupJul 03,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32We can provide a variety of processing systems inclusive of equipment and infrastructure to achieve the final tailings product that is required by the customer,from thickening to create a paste or applying a filter to produce a product which can be dry deposited.
