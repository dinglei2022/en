## Ask HILTI
ACI 318 14,in 1752 (c),allows for shear forces parallel to an edge,the concrete breakout strength,Vcbg,to be twice the value of Eq 17521b,albeit using Psi(ed,v) with a value of 10 Although our forces are parallel to the edge,Profis seems to be using and applying only the perpendicular concrete breakout strengthReinforced Concrete DesignReinforced Concrete Design Notation: a = depth of the effective compression block in a concrete beam.c = concrete compressive design strength at 28 days.
