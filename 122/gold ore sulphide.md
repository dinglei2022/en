## How gold is made history,used,parts,procedure.
In the last few years,several companies have focused on extracting gold from sulphide ore rather than oxide ore.Previous techniques made such extraction difficult and expensive,but a newer technique called bioleaching has made extraction more feasible.Gold Ore Sorting : TOMRASensor based ore sorting transforms the bottom line in gold mining Exploring gold ores becomes more challenging every year.Mines increasingly deliver lower grades and complex mineralogy,forcing mills to process more material and thus compounding the expanding ratio between these tonnages and the ounces of ore produced.

## Pretreatment Process on Refractory Gold Ores with As J Stage
Keywords: arsenic bearing gold ore,pretreatment process,refractory gold ore.In ores with a high sulphide content this treatment involves the production of&nbsp;.Gold Mineral Fact Sheets Australian Mines AtlasIn refractory ore,gold is locked in the sulphide minerals so that,to achieve satisfactory levels of gold recovery,additional processing such as roasting or biological leaching is required before cyanidation.Sulphide minerals in refractory ores are converted to oxides by either roasting or biological leaching to release the gold.In biological leaching the oxidation is caused by the action.
