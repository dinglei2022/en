## Tin (Sn) and Zinc
Anatolia has rich deposits of many metal ores and,as we also learned in more.The tin ore in the Kestel mines was mainly contained in hematite (an iron oxide) easily.This necessitates crushing and separation of the stuff,so altogether tin.converted hematite (Fe2O3 density 5.26 g cm3) to the black magnetic oxide.Study of New Process Technology for Lowgrade RefractoryStudy of New Process Technology for Lowgrade Refractory Zinc Oxide Ore along with a little amount of zinc sulfides.Magnetic separation Magnetic Con.Bulk flotation of sulfides Limestone ore classifiion grinding 80% 0.074mm sulfides cleaner ZnS Con.Tailings ZnO rougher I ZnO Con.ZnO middlings ZnO cleaner ZnO rougher II 2.0T to

## A novel process to upgrade the copper slag by direct
An innovative technology for direct reductionmagnetic separation with the addition of Na 2 CO 3 and CaO was studied to upgrade copper slag assaying 40.33% Fe total and 0.65% Cu.It is difficult to recover iron and copper from the slag by direct reduction since the iron mainly occurs in fayalite and the copper exists in copper sulfide.Investigation on the Beneficiation of Low Grade Manganese,Flotation,magnetic separation and leaching experiments have been carried out for the beneficiation of low grade manganese ore The results indicated that flotation and magnetic separation could improve the grade of Mn concentrate while the recovery was lower Better recovery of Mn could be achieved by leaching on optimum conditions,9178% of Mn could be recovered by 30 minutes leaching with.
