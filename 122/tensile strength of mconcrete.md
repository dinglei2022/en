## Why Does Concrete Have Great Compressive Strength,But,
Tensile strength of concrete The tensile strength of a material is simply the measurement of the force required to pull something to the point that it breaks In other words,you could say that the tensile strength of a material is the maximum tension it can withstand without breakingAn Evaluation of Tensile Strength Testing Research…estimate the tensile strength of portland cement concrete pavement.Information measured by the flexure beam test to a tensile strength value measured by the.
