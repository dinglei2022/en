## What is the cleavage of gold Answers
Gold is a very soft element and because of the gold alloys,gold may vary in cleavage.Pure cold has no cleavage,it has a fracture.It fractures in hackles with torn surfaces.Mineral Cleavage &amp Fracture Kids Love RocksCleavage and fracture are descriptions of how a mineral breaks into pieces.Cleavage.Cleavage describes how a mineral breaks into flat surfaces (usually one,two,three or four surfaces).Cleavage is determined by the crystal structure of the mineral.Common Cleavage Descriptions

## CALAVERITE (Gold Telluride) Amethyst Galleries' Mineral
Calaverite is one of the few minerals that is an ore of gold,besides native gold itself.It is the most common gold bearing mineral besides native gold.The element gold is typically either found as native gold (in its elemental state),as an alloy with other metals such as silver and copper and as trace amounts in a few minerals.Gold Mineral Specimen For SaleGold Nice size grain of Gold to 4mm in chloritic schist.This and many more mineral specimens are available for sale at Dakota Matrix Minerals.

## Mineral Identifiion Earth Science
Different minerals may be the same color.Real gold,as seen in Figure below,Mohs Hardness Scale is used to compare the hardness of minerals.Cleavage or the characteristic way a mineral breaks depends on the crystal structure of the mineral.Physical Characteristics of Minerals.Mineral Identifiion.Points to Consider.3 Minerals An Introduction to Geology3.4.5 Native Element Minerals Native copper Native sulfur deposited around a volcanic fumarole.Native element minerals,usually metals,occur in nature in a pure or nearly pure state.Gold is an example of a native element mineral it is not very reactive and rarely bonds with other elements so it is

## Minerals Cleavage and Fracture
Cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break along smooth planes parallel to zones of weak bonding.Fracture is the tendency of a mineral to break along curved surfaces without a definite shape.These minerals do not have planes of weakness and break irregularly.See the picture below:Mineral Identifiion Key Table IBThe Mineral Identifiion Key Table IB: Minerals with Metallic or Submetallic Luster &amp Hardness greater than 2&#189,but less than 5&#189: (Will not easily mark paper,but can be scratched with a pocket knife.)

## How to Identify 10 Red and Pink Minerals ThoughtCo
Jun 22,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Here are some rules of thumb about red minerals: 99 times out of 100,a deep red,transparent mineral is a garnet,and 99 times out of 100,a red or orange sedimentary rock owes its color to microscopic grains of the iron oxide minerals hematite and goethite.A transparent mineral that's pale red is a clear mineral that owes its color to impurities.Mineral Identifiion TableMinerals (Na,Ca,Mg,Fe,Al Silies) Luster nonmetallic.Color dark green to black.Hardness 6.Cleavage 2 directions at nearly 90&#186 (pyroxene) and 2 directions at 60&#186 and 120&#186 (amphibole).Darkcolored igneous rocks and gneiss.Some amphibole minerals formerly used as asbestos some pyroxene minerals used as source of lithium.
