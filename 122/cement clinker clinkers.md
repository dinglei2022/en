## Clinker Cement Science
Limestone is softer than cement clinkers,thus could be grind into finer particles.When it interground with clinkers,for an overall specific surface area (Blaine) of 420 m 2 kg,50% of the limestone can be below 700nm,compared with 3 &#181m for the corresponding clinker.Addition of finer limestone particles to clinker completes the fineCement Clinker,Portland Cement Clinker Suppliers ThailandCement clinkers are formed by the heat processing of cement elements in a kiln.Limestone,clay,bauxite,and iron ore sand in specific proportions are heated in a rotating kiln at 2,770&#176 Fahrenheit until they begin to form cinder lumps,which are also known as cement clinkers.These are usually ground with gypsum,to produce the fine powder

Clinker minerals react with water to produce the hydrates that are responsible for cement's setting and strengthgiving properties.Reaction with water occurs only at the surface of the clinker particle,and so only proceeds rapidly if the clinker is finely ground to produce a large reaction surface.10 Basic Facts on Clinker Clinker and Cement20191028&ensp&#0183&enspCrusher operation raw mill operation rotary kiln operation cement mill operation vertical cement mill clinker quality cement quality white clinker Clinker and Cement Figure 21 below shows the results of laboratoryground cement made from two industrial clinkers with two different sulfate addition rates (2 3 gypsum 1 3 SH).
