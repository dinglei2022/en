## 10 Tips for Designing with Current Sense Resistors
This means keeping the sense circuitry as close as possible to the sense resistor and running the voltage sense tracks close to each other.A good way to keep these tracks really close is to superimpose them in different PCB layers.Resistors Electronics ClubResistor values are often written on circuit diagrams using a code system which avoids using a decimal point because it is easy to miss the small dot.Instead the letters R,K and M are used in place of the decimal point.To read the code: replace the letter with a decimal point,then multiply the value by 1000 if the letter was K,or 1000000 if the letter was M.

## Resistors in Series and Parallel Boundless Physics
Resistors in Series and Parallel.Essentially,wire resistance is a series with the resistor.It thus increases the total resistance and decreases the current.If wire resistance is relatively large,as in a worn (or a very long) extension cord,then this loss can be significant.If a ‚Ä¶Resistors DigiKey ElectronicsFor your convenience we have provided links to the many types of resistors Digi Key Electronics sells: from our complete resistor families (Through Hole,Chip Resistors,Chassis Mount) down to the unique application specific resistors (High Power,Automotive,Safety).
