## Modifiion and Refinement of AluminumSilicon Alloys
2018424&ensp&#0183&enspThe addition of certain elements,such as calcium,sodium,strontium,and antimony,to hypoeutectic aluminumsilicon alloys results in a finer lamellar or fibrous eutectic network.It is also understood that increased solidifiion rates are useful in providing similar structures.There is,however,no agreement on the mechanisms involved.Profiling of Antimony Diffusivity in Silicon SubstratesIn conventional IC processing,solidstate diffusion is an isothermal process as the substrate is heated uniformly to high temperatures (9001300&#176C),so that the dopant atoms have sufficient energy to move through the lattice of substrate.Such process is emerging from the gradient in impurity concentrations that induces atoms to
