&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Re: how to estimate the wear rate for Ball mill.Ball wear can be measured by weighing an entire charge before and after grinding a known tonnage of materials.With new balls sample of given size can be weighed before and after grinding a given tonnage and,assuming uniform wear per unit of ball surface,the total charge wear can be estimated.Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum Grinding.Aug 2,2013.In Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that.factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and tear.
