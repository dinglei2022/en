## Why the concentration of minerals in the soil is always
Sep 28,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32Source of all minerals is soil.While up taking the minerals from soil,root tissues concentrate them as per their requirement.So basically due to concentrating effort by root tissue due to its selective activity it has higher concentration.AbsoGravity Concentration Mineral Concentrators APTGravity concentration is one of the oldest,well proven solutions used to extract precious minerals from the surrounding material.It is based on the difference in.

## Mineral processing metallurgy Britannica.com
Mineral processing,art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock,or gangue.It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.The primary operations are comminution and concentration,but there are other important operations.Electrostatic Concentration Ores & MineralsElectrostatic separation of ores in its present form is generally known as the Huff process,from the name of Charles H.Huff,of Boston,Mass.through whose constant and persistent labors (with the invention of Clinton E.Dolbear as a basis) the successful commercial process embracing separative machinery and the various electrifying devices.
