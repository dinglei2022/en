## What is Silica Fume?
One of the most beneficial uses for silica fume is in concrete Because of its chemical and physical properties,it is a very reactive pozzolan Concrete containing silica fume can have very high strength and can be very durable,The raw materials are quartz,coal,and woodchips The smoke that results from furnace operation is collected.clinker factor Page 1 of 2 International Cement ReviewNov 10,2010&nbsp&#0183&#32Re: clinker factor.The majority of Portland cement clinker manufactured around the world has a lime saturation of between 90 and 100%.This means that c.1.55 tonnes of raw mix are required and c.0.55 tonnes of CO2 are lost due to calcination of the CaCO3 in the raw material.

## What is Silica Fume?
The raw materials are quartz,coal,and woodchips.The smoke that results from furnace operation is collected and sold as silica fume,rather than being landfilled.Perhaps the most important use of this material is as a mineral admixture in concrete.Power plant ashes as substitute raw materials CementMagazine Articles Power plant ashes as substitute raw materials Power plant ashes as substitute raw materials 19 November 2012 A hard coal power plant: Cooling towers are on the left The generator,boiler house and other facilities on the right,Such applications include usage as an additive in concrete as cement replacement material,

## Types of Chemical Admixtures The Concrete Network
Mineral admixtures affect the nature of the hardened concrete through hydraulic or pozzolanic activity.Pozzolans are cementitious materials and include natural pozzolans (such as the volcanic ash used in Roman concrete),fly ash and silica fume.They can be used with Portland cement,or blended cement either individually or in combinations.
