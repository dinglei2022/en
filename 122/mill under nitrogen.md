## RESPONSE OF TOMATO (Lycopersicum esculentum var.Mill) TO
A randomized complete block experiment was carried out at the teaching and research farm of Federal University of Technology,Akure (7 16 N,5 12 E) loed in the rain forest vegetation zone of Nigeria,to examine the response of tomato to NitrogenCryogenic Grinding &amp; AttritorsAn additional benefit of cryogenic milling in an internally agitated ball mill is the ability to fully immerse the product in liquid nitrogen during milling.The level of liquid nitrogen in the milling chamber can be maintained via a thermocouple and liquid nitrogen flow controller system.

grain,nitrogen transport is especially important during the grain filling (Zhang et al.2017).However,abiotic stresses often limit crop growth and N uptake by a direct or indirect effect.Thus,it is important to understand the dry matter and nitrogen accumulation,partitioning and translocation of crops under stress conditions.Nitrogen fixation in the treatment of pulp and paperAlthough acetylene reduction demonstrated the presence of nitrogen fixation,nitrogen balances were used to quantify the extent of fixation.Table 3.Activated sludge treatment of a bleached kraft mill effluent under both nitrogen fixing and nitrogen fed operation ~e.~ct~rperfonn~~.e~ ~~ .
