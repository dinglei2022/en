Jun 20,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32That would be incredibly dangerous.Exposure to large amounts of cesium137 can cause burns,radiation sickness and increase the risk of cancer and in case of very large quantities,death.Because cesium137 is so easily dispersed in air,this also makes it an "ideal" material for a dirty bomb.Radioactive Cesium137 From Fukushima Is In California WineJul 26,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32California wine lovers will get to test that theory,after researchers at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) discovered cesium137 in several goldenstate vintages.The researchers tested 18 bottles of California ros&#233 and cabernet sauvignon from 2009 onward finding increased levels of the radioactive isotope in bottles produced after the Fukushima disaster.

## 5 SELFCONTAINED IRRADIATORS Radiation Source Use and
Most selfcontained irradiators use a radionuclide radiation source,with the vast majority being cesium137 because of its long halflife,relatively low cost,and relatively modest shielding requirements,which make it possible to place a device in the upper floors of some hospitals and blood banks.Current Results How Radioactive is Our Ocean?Cesium137 undergoes radioactive decay with a 30year halflife and was introduced to the environment during atmospheric weapons testing in the 1950s and '60s.Along with cesium137,we detected cesium134 which also does not occur naturally in the environment and has a halflife of just two years.
