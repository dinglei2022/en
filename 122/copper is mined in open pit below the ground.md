## Public hearing set for controversial Resolution Copper
The process is cheaper —about 90% less than traditional openpit mining — and generates less waste rock.Resolution's mine would tunnel 7,000 feet below the surface.Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining &amp ExtractionEl Teniente,in Chile,is the world's largest underground copper mine.Open pit mining is employed when the orebodies are extensive,low in grade,and relatively near the surface,where they can be quarried after removal of overburden.Chile also boasts the world's largest (in terms of output) openpit copper mine,Escondida.

## Innovations: How Do They Do That? How Copper is Made
Copper ore,in concentrations ranging from 0.29 percent to ten times that amount,is mined from open pit or underground mines.The crushed mine ore is ground in rod and ball mills and then sent to flotation machines where the copper mineral rises to the top in a froth,making a copper concentrate of approximately 30 percent,27 percent iron and 33 percent sulfur.The World's 20 Largest Copper MinesJun 25,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32The world's 20 largest copper mines produce nearly 9 million metric tons of the precious metal a year,about 40 percent of the world's total copper mine capacity.Chile and Peru,alone,account for about half of the copper mines on this list,but the U.S.does make the cut,with two mines
