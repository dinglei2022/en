## Ball Mill
Ball mills give a controlled final grind and produce flotation feed of a uniform size.Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore.The balls are initially 5 10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds.The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 voBall MillBall mills are among the most variable and effective tools when it comes to size reduction of hard,brittle or fibrous materials.The variety of grinding modes,usable volumes and available grinding tool materials make ball mills the perfect match for a vast range of applications.

## AMIT 135: Lesson 7 Ball Mills &amp; Circuits Mining Mill.
Number,size and mass of each ball size depends on mill load and whether or not the media is being added as the initial charge.For the initial chargin of a mill,Coghill and DeVaney (1937) defined the ball size as a function of the top size of the feed,i.e.d↓V = 0.40 K√F dB = ball size (cm) F = feed size (cm)Variables in Ball Mill Operation Paul O.Abbe&#174;The first problem will ball mills is that we cannot see what is occurring in the mill.The other problem is that many of the independent variables are non linear or have paradoxical effects on the end results.In ball milling of dry solids the main independent variables are mill di
