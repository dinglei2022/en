Leaching is the process by which constituents of a solid material are released into a contacting water phase.Although some species may be more of an environmental concern than others,the leaching process is indiscriminant such that all constituents (e.g.major or minor matrix components as well as inorganic,organic and radionuclide contaminants) are released under a common set of chemicalLeaching in Metallurgy and Metal RecoveryJul 10,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32The simple act of steeping tea is,in fact,very similar to the process of leaching in metal recovery.Although you may be skeptical of my comparison,I assure you that I can explain what I mean.Leaching,by definition,is the process of extracting a substance from a solid material,after it has been in contact with a liquid.
