“The Matthews correlation coefficient is used in machine learning as a measure of the quality of binary (two class) classifications It takes into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally regarded as a balanced measure which can be used even if the classes are of very different sizClassification Algorithm in Machine Learning JavatpointThe Classification algorithm is a Supervised Learning technique that is used to identify the category of new observations on the basis of training data In Classification,a program learns from the given dataset or observations and then classifies new observation into a number of classes or groups Such as,Yes or No,0 or 1,Spam or Not Spam.
