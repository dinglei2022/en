## Improved Concrete Properties Using Quarry Dust as
Quarry dust has been proposed as an alternative to river sand that gives additional benefit to concrete.Quarry dust is known to increase the strength of concrete over concrete made with equal quantities of river sand.The Compressive strength of quarry dust concrete continues to increase with age for all the percentage of quarry dust contents.Replacement of Natural Sand by Crushed Sand in theMar 01,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32Nowadays it is very important to make the concrete economical.Therefore the present work has initiated to make the concrete economical by replacing the natural sand by crushed sand in the concrete.From our study it is concluded that different Crushed sand gives different results for compressive strength depending on different quarries and from study of different research paper at
