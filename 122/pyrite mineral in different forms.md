Pyrite is widely distributed and forms under extremely varied conditions.For example,it can be produced by magmatic (molten rock) segregation,by hydrothermal solutions,and as stalactitic growth.It occurs as an accessory mineral in igneous rocks,in vein deposits with quartz and sulfide minerals,and in sedimentary rocks,such as shale.Types of Ore MiningHallOfFame.orgThe metals in ore can occur in many different minerals (compounds) in the rock.As an example,copper occurs in more than 50 minerals with varying percentages of copper in the chemical formulas of those minerals.The richest grade of copper ore is native copper,which is pure copper (100%).
