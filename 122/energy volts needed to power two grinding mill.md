## How a Wind Turbine Works Department of Energy
The concept of harnessing wind energy to generate mechanical power goes back for millennia.As early as 5000 B.C.Egyptians used wind energy to propel boats along the Nile River.American colonists relied on windmills to grind grain,pump water and cut wood at sawmills.Today’s wind turbines are the windmill’s modern equivalent converting the kinetic energy in wind into clean.Mill (grinding)A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().

## What are amps,watts,volts and ohms? HowStuffWorks
Electrical power is measured in watts.In an electrical system power (P) is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current.The water analogy still applies.Take a hose and point it at a waterwheel like the ones that were used to turn grinding stones in watermills.You can increase the power generated by the waterwheel in two ways.Mill (grinding) WikipediaA mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().Related items: Mortar and pestle,Expeller,Extruder
