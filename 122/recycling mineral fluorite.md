## Camera Lenses — Design LifeCycle
The majority of the waste related to camera lenses comes indirectly from the conversion of energy to power plants and equipment that develops camera lenses.Because high amounts of electricity and heat are needed to form the precision elements of camera lenses,large amounts of fuel are required to power the machinery to develop camera lenses.Fluorite: Mineral information,data and localities.Fluorite Group.Fluorite is found as a common gangue mineral in hydrothermal veins,especially those containing lead and zinc minerals.It is also found in some greisens,granites,pegmatites and hightemperature veins,and as a component of some marbles and other metamorphic rocks.
