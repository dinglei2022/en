Potash and soda feldspar occur as essential constituents of granite,syenite and gneisses.However,workable deposits are found in pegmatite veins consisting mainly of feldspar,quartzfeldspar veins and also occur with mica pegmatites.Feldspar is of widespread occurrence and is mined in almost all countries.Feldspars are aluminosilies.What is Feldspar? Industrial Minerals AssociationFeldspar is by far the most abundant group of minerals in the earth's crust,forming about 60% of terrestrial rocks.Most deposits offer sodium feldspar as well as potassium feldspar and mixed feldspars.Feldspars are primarily used in industrial appliions for their alumina and alkali content.

Labradorite (An 50 70) is determinable in fractions coarser than 5&#181; Feldspars are determined by allocation of residue K,Na and Ca to their equivalent endmember feldspars,with suitable correction factors for mineral solubility and for increase of Na from pyrosulfate in K and Ca feldspars The remainder of the residue is allocated to quartzQuebec Marble and Granite CountertopsQUALITY Granite is normally a coarse grained igneous rock that is comprised of quartz,feldspars and micas The quartz will be be the lighter color minerals with the remaining consisting of feldspars and muscovite The dark minerals are hornblende or biotite Granite is by far the most common rock found in the outer crust of the planet
