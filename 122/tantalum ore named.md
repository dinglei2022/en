## TANTALITE (Iron Manganese Tantalum Niobium Oxide)
Tantalite is the most widespread tantalum mineral and makes for an important ore of the industrially useful metal.Tantalum is used in alloys for strength and higher melting points,in glass to increase the index of refraction,and in surgical steel,as it is nonreactive and nonirritating to body tissues.Economic Geology of Niobium and TantalumTantalum ore has characteristically grades of about 0.03% Ta 2 O 5,generally as a coproduct of cassiterite and other minerals.Note that because of facile overgrinding,metallurgical recovery of columbite by crushing and milling hardrock ore is often as low as 50%.Tantalum is silvery grey,heavy and very hard but malleable and ductile.

## Tantalum Ta PubChem
The biocompatibility of two types of radiopaque tantalum markers was evaluated histologically.Reactions to pin markers (99.9% purity) and spherical markers (95.2% purity) were investigated after 36 wks in rabbits and 548 wks in children with abnormal growth.Tantalite: Mineral information,data and localities.An obsolete group name for minerals with the general formula (Mn,Fe)(Ta,Nb) 2 O 6,equivalent to the Tantalite(Fe)Tantalite(Mn) Series.Generally mangandominant members are more abundant in nature.Many specimens called tantalite actually belong to the columbite series or tapiolite series.Visit gemdat for gemological information about Tantalite.

## Tantalum Element information,properties and uses
An oxide layer which forms on the surface of tantalum can act as an insulating (dielectric) layer.Because tantalum can be used to coat other metals with a very thin layer,a high capacitance can be achieved in a small volume.This makes tantalum capacitors attractive for portable electronics such as mobile phones.NIOBIUM What's in a name?Niobium was discovered by Charles Hatchett in 1801,England.It was discovered in an American ore (naturally occurring material from the earth,rich in particular elements,such as iron ore) that had been sent to England about a century earlier.Hatchett discovered this ore and named the new element found in

The name columbium,which Hatchett named the new element,came from the poetic name for North America—Columbia—and was used interchangeably for niobium until 1949,when the name niobium became official.Swedish scientist Anders Ekberg discovered tantalum in 1802,but it was confusedTantalum capacitor WikipediaA tantalum electrolytic capacitor is an electrolytic capacitor,a passive component of electronic circuits.It consists of a pellet of porous tantalum metal as an anode,covered by an insulating oxide layer that forms the dielectric,surrounded by liquid or solid electrolyte as a hode.Because of its very thin and relatively high permittivity dielectric layer,the tantalum capacitor
