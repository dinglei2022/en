## Sludge Mr.Youngberg's Science Classes
What is sludge? Sludge is a jar of 2 liquids,4 solids,a dissolved salt and an insoluble powder all mixed together.The student's task is to separate out all the items and identify the items using their chemical and physical properties.There are about 1215 labs that the student will have to perform in order to correctly separate and item the samples.APPENDIX H EXAMPLE OF SLUDGE SAMPLING PROCEDURE Ttransportation to the laboratory.14.Prior to delivering the samples to the lab,complete a chainofcustody sheet to document proper sample handling.15.After sample delivery,clean all equipment according to established procedures and store in a clean,dry area.Appendix H: Example of Sludge Sampling Procedure H2

## Sludge Conditioning to Improve Filtration Sludge Press
Their potential advantage as sludge conditioners lies in the fact that they are normally fed in relatively low dosages and,therefore,result in an insignificant addition to the amount of sludge requiring dewatering.Polymers,as applied to clarifiion and sludge conditioning appliions,fall into one of three egories.Flocculants: Selecting Polymers and Jar Testing ProceduresIn addition to jar tests,settling tests using graduated cylinders can also be run to determine the effect of polymer dosage on floc size,settling rate,and sludge compactness.Lastly,Buchner funnels and leaf filters can be used in sludge dewatering appliions to

## Assessment of Using Chemical Coagulants and Effective
In sludge dewatering practice the descriptive parameter is the specific resistance of Sludge (SRF) test,which is known as the Buchner funnel test.It is one of the most commonly employed tests for the evaluation of wastewater sludge dewaterability or filterability.HighTesting and Analysis of Consolidated Sludge Samples fromTesting activities presented in this report include particle size measurement via wet sieving,sludge settling and sludge density measurements,sludge shear strength measurement,and measurement of sludge dissolution enthalpy to ascertain the uranium metal content of the sludge.Section 1.0 provides the summary and conclusions to date.
