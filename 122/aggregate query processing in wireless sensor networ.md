## An adaptive in network aggregation operator for query,
In this paper,we propose an adaptive in network aggregation operator for query processing in sensor nodes of a WSN,called ADAGA (ADaptive AGgregation Algorithm for sensor networks) The ADAGA adapts its behavior according to memory and energy usage by dynamically adjusting data collection and data sending time intervalsEnergy e cient query aggregation and optimization scheme,In order to provide e cient data services for sensor network applications,an overlay based query aggregation approach including a query manager and an eﬁective query aggregation algorithm was presented in [16] The query manager,located at the base station,is mainly devoted to deﬂning the global query aggregation plan,and the query.

## In Network Aggregation with Grouped Queries in multi hop,
This project is about supporting aggregate queries in wireless sensor networks Aggregate queries are queries of type MAX,MIN,AVG and SUM The wireless sensor network here refers to a set of sensor nodes forming a multi hop wireless network In a multi hop wireless network,Robust and Efficient Aggregate Query Processing in,Wireless sensor networks have been widely used in many applications,such as soil temperature monitoring for plant growth and abnormal event detection of industrial parameters Among these applications,aggregate queries,such as SUM,COUNT,AVERAGE,MIN and MAX are often used to collect statistical data
