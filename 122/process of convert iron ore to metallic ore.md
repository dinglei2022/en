## The Process of Turning Iron Ore into Steel The Short.
The steelmaking process starts with the processing of raw iron ore.The rocks that are mined containing iron ore are ground and the near elemental iron is extracted using magnetic rollers.This fine iron ore is then processed into clumps that can be put inside of a blast furnace.At the same time,coal is cleaned of impurities in a furnace.Iron processing Britannica1 day ago&ensp&#0183&enspIron processing,use of a smelting process to turn the ore into a form from which products can be fashioned.Included in this article also is a discussion of the mining of iron and of its preparation for smelting.Iron (Fe) is a relatively dense metal with a silvery white appearance and distinctive magnetic properties.It constitutes 5 percent by weight of the Earth's crust,and it is the

## process of convert iron ore to metallic ore
Iron ore smelting process,iron ores consist of oxygen and iron atoms bonded together into molecul To convert it to metallic iron it must be smelted or sent through a direct reduction process to remove the oxygen oxygen iron bonds are strong,and to remove the iron from the oxygen,a stronger elemental bond must be presented to attach to the oxygenRoasting (metallurgy)2020 2 8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Roasting is a process of heating of sulphide ore to a high temperature in presence of air.It is a step of the processing of certain ores.More specifically,roasting is a metallurgical process involving gas solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s).Often before roasting,the ore has already been partially purified,e.g.by froth flotation.
