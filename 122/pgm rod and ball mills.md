## What is a Rod Mill? (with picture)
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Common examples are rod and ball mills,both of which are of the rotary drum type which rely on internal grinding agents to achieve their milling action.Unlike the ball mill which utilizes a large number of hardened steel balls to impart the grinding action,the rod mill uses steel rods lying within the drum and parallel to its axis.Rod mills,how they functionRod mills are very similar to ball mills,except they use long rods for grinding media.The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill,similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill.To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling,the length to d
