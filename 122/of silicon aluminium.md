## Silicon Metal CRM Alliance Critical Raw Materials
Silicon metal is commonly produced by smelting submerged electric arc furnaces,which is an energyintensive process.Further processing of the material into different product grades makes it applicable in many industry processes.The industry is investing in R&ampD,a.o.for the development of high value silicon bound to the photovoltaic marketSilicon WikipediaSilicon's importance in aluminium casting is that a significantly high amount (12%) of silicon in aluminium forms a eutectic mixture which solidifies with very little thermal contraction.This greatly reduces tearing and cracks formed from stress as casting alloys cool to solidity.
