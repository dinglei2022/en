COAL HANDLING PLANT • Coal is transported to power station by rail or road and stored in coal storage plant and then pulverized.• The function of coal handling plant is automatic feeding of coal to the boiler furnace.• A thermal power plant burns enormous amounts of coal.• A 200MW plant may require around 2000 tons of coal daily.8.Increasing the flexibility of coalfired power plants2018315&ensp&#0183&enspIncreasingly,coalfired power plants are required to balance power grids by compensating for the variable electricity supply from renewable energy sources.For this,high flexibility is needed,in terms of possessing resilience to frequent startups,meeting major and rapid l oad changes,and providing frequency control duties.
