## Chromium and Nickel in Welding Fume
chromium and nickel and their inorganic compounds should be considered occupational carcinogens (cancercausing agents).Definite effects are not yet determined.NIOSH Criteria Documents 76 129 and 77 164 (listed below) contain these conclusions based on data from the chromate producing industry and from nickel orerefining processes.Influence of chromium and impurities on the SpringerLinkAbstract.The grainrefining behavior of high purity aluminum (HPA1) and commercial purity aluminum (CPA1) containing Fe and Si as impurities (&lt0.2 wt pct each) has been studied with and without the presence of Cr in small and large quantities (0.2 and 2 wt pct).

## THE OXIDATION AND REDUCTION OF CHROMIUM OF
The oxidation of chromium during the elaboration of stainless steels occurs with oxygen in solution blown in the melt and with oxides in the slag.A higher content of silicon in the furnace charge decreases the extent of oxidation of chromium,however,the efficient reduction of chromium from the slag is of essential importanceHardening Guide KMTSThe magic content for "stainless" is 10.5% chromium dissolved in the matrix.Remember that there will always be chromium bound to the carbon in the carbides.So even if a steel specifiion says 13 % chromium,the content in the matrix may still be less than 10.5% and the steel will then not be stainless in normal use.Proper
