## Rajasthan State Mines and Minerals Wikipedia
Rajasthan State Mines &amp Minerals Limited (RSMML) is a public sector enterprise of the Government of Rajasthan and primarily engaged in Mining and Marketing of High Grade Rock phosphate,Lignite,Limestone &amp Gypsum (NonMetallic minerals) through its mines loed at various loions in Rajasthan.RSMML is a multiple loion organization which originated from a private company Bikaner GypsumMineral Fertilizers For Boosting Soil FertilityThe calcium in rock phosphate and fish bone meal isn't in an available form,so it doesn't count much for calcium.Your gypsum is good,provided you also need the sulfur,which more soils do than don't.Yes,150lbs does seem right based on your numbers,but you don't necessarily have to add it all in one year.

## Phosphogypsum Wikipedia
Phosphogypsum refers to the calcium sulfate hydrate formed as a byproduct of the production of fertilizer from phosphate rock.It is mainly composed of gypsum (CaSO 4 &#1832H 2 O).Although gypsum is a widely used material in the construction industry,phosphogypsum is usually not used,but is stored indefinitely because of its weak radioactivity.The longrange storage is controversial.Gypsum Mineral Uses and PropertiesGypsum is an evaporite mineral most commonly found in layered sedimentary deposits in association with halite,anhydrite,sulfur,calcite,and dolomite.Gypsum (CaSO 4.2H 2 O) is very similar to Anhydrite (CaSO 4).The chemical difference is that gypsum contains two waters and anhydrite is without water.Gypsum is the most common sulfate mineral.
