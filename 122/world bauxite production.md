## Top 10 Largest Bauxite Producing Countries In The World …
Bauxite is usually strip mined because it is almost always found near the surface of the terrain,with little or no overburden.As of 2010 [update],approximately 70% to 80% of the world's dry bauxite production is processed first into alumina and then into.[8]List of countries by bauxite productionWorld bauxite output in 2005.Bauxite is the most important aluminum ore.This form of rock consists mostly of the minerals gibbsite Al(OH) 3,boehmite γ AlO(OH),and diaspore α AlO(OH),in a mixture that usually includes the two iron oxides goethite and 2.

In 2011 nearly 260 million tonnes of bauxite was produced world wide.The majority of this material was consumed incountry for the production of smelter grade alumna.The one outlier in this respect is Indonesia which,with no domestic alumina industry,exports its production.Where bauxite is found? AnswersDrive— Guinea has the world's largest bauxite reserves and is the biggest exporter of the ore while Australia tops the world in mine production.— The Huntly mine in Australia,owned by Alcoa World Alumina,is the world's largest,producing 18 million tonnes in 2006.
