## uses and function of stopwatch in physics laboratory
Sep 17,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32A stopwatch is used to measure the time interval of an event in the laboratory.It has two types digital and mechanical or analog stopwatch.Digital stopwatch can measure time interval up to 0.01 s and analog or mechanical stopwatch can measure time interval up to 0.1 s.Newton's cradle WikipediaWhen this occurs,the complete solution method described below must be used.Small steel balls work well because they remain efficiently elastic with little heat loss under strong strikes and do not compress much (up to about 30 μm in a small Newton's cradle).

## Physics Of Billiards Real World Physics Problems
Physics Of Billiards Ball Collision The physics behind billiards (or the physics behind pool),in large part,involves collisions between billiard balls.When two billiard balls collide the collision is nearly elastic.An elastic collision is one in which the kinetic energy of the system is conserved before and after impact.Ball Launched With a Spring Physics University ofAt the start of the problem,the ball is in the toy.The ch has not yet been released,and so the ball is at rest against the compressed spring.The spring force is a conservative force,and so the energy used to compress the spring has been stored in the system.Therefore,you know to include a spring potential energy term for the ball at

## OpenStax College Physics Solution,Chapter 7,Problem 63
This is College Physics Answers with Shaun Dychko.This toy gun has a spring constant of 300 Newtons per meter and the mass of the steel ball inside of it is 0.01 kilograms,I've to convert the ten grams to kilograms,and the spring inside of it gets compressed seven centimeters which is seven times ten to the minus two meters.magnetic fields Why is a steel ballbearing repelledBasically,Professor Laithwaite demonstrates that a piece of unmagnetised steel will attract a steel ballbearing away from a magnet,where the magnetic field is weakened by placing a piece of cardboard between the magnet and the ballbearing.This surprised me.

## Ask a Physicist Answers Physics Central
Steel is so hard that it barely dents at all and therefore doesn't store any of the collision energy.All the storing and bouncing is up to the ball.Most rubbers are pretty efficient at this job,but not as efficient as steel itself.Such balls just don't rebound as high as a steel ball when you drop them on a steel surface.
