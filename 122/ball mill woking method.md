## HOW BALL MILL WORKS?
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The drum of the ball mill (Pic.1) is a hollow cylinder of steel,lined inside with armor lining plates which protect it from impact and friction effects of the balls and the grinding material.The shape of drum liners has a significant impact on mill’s work.Drum Liners of ball mills operated on a large source material have ribs.PARTICLE SIZE REDUCTION TECHNIQUES&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;BALL MILL Principle: The ball mill works on the impact between the rapidly moving ball and the powder material,both enclosed in a hollow cylinder.Thus,in the ball mill,impact or attrition or both are responsible for the size reduction.Fig: Ball mill 13 14.Working: The drug is filled into cylinder 60% of the volume.
