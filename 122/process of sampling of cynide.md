## Cyanide Wikipedia
In the cyanide process,finely ground high grade ore is mixed with the cyanide (concentration of about two kilogram NaCN per tonne); low grade ores are stacked into heaps and sprayed with a cyanide solution (concentration of about one kilogram NaCN per ton).The precious metals are complexed by the cyanide anions&nbsp;.How silver is made material,making,history,usedThis process consists of crushing the ore,adding cement,mixing,adding water or a cyanide solution,and curing in dry air for 2448 hours.2 Broken or crushed ore is stacked on impermeable pads to eliminate the loss of the silver cyanide solution.Pad material may be
