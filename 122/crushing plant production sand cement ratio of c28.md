## Creep behaviour of concrete using recycled coarse
Available creep models for recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) only consider the effect of residual mortar content (C RM).This paper highlighted how the creep of RAC was also influenced by the property of the residual mortar which highly depended on the watertocement ratio of the source concrete (w or c or) and how the increase in creep which was induced by the recycled coarse aggregate (RCACost and Ecological Feasibility of Using Ultra High20171129&ensp&#0183&enspCost and Ecological Feasibility of Using UltraHigh Performance Concrete in Highway due to UHPC's low watertocement ratio,with savings averaging approximately 50% of the conventional concrete design case.cement,water,and steel is consumed.The cement production process consumes vast amounts of energy and fuel and creates large
