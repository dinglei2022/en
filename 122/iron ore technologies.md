## Abstract Autonomous Technologies in Iron Ore
20191115&ensp&#0183&enspAutonomous Technologies in Iron Ore.The iron ore industry has seen a rapid adoption of autonomous technologies during the last decade.Although autonomous trucks have been an industry concept since the early 1990's (the author was witness to them trialled in 1993),it wasn't until 2008 that Rio Tinto Iron Ore first implemented airon ore separation technologies ANDRITZ2017221&ensp&#0183&enspwith leading iron ore separation technologies Changing ore grades.Unpredictable prices.Higher throughputs.In many ways,the need to improve efficiency in iron ore dewatering has never been more intense.Our approach? To surround you with the industry's most innovative solid liquid separation technologies.

## How the Iron Age Changed the World livescience
The metal was probably discovered there by accident when some ore was dropped into a fire and cooled into wrought iron,historians think.The Celts diffused iron technology over much of theHIsarna ironmaking process WikipediaThe HIsarna ironmaking process is a direct reduced iron process for iron making in which iron ore is processed almost directly into liquid iron or hot metal.The process combines two process units,the Cyclone Converter Furnace (CCF) for ore melting and prereduction and a Smelting Reduction Vessel (SRV) where the final reduction stage to liquid iron takes place.

## Direct Reduced Iron Industrial Efficiency Technology
Direct Reduced Iron (DRI),also known as Sponge Iron,offers an alternative steel production route to BFBOF and ScrapEAF routes.In DRI,iron ore is reduced in its solid state unlike BF process where a liquid metal is formed during reduction.DRI can then be transformed to steel in electric arc furnaces.DRI production is common in Middle East,South America,India and Mexico.
