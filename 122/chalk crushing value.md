## The 10 Best Climbing Chalks for 2019 RAVE Reviews
Chalk is that magical white dust that athletes,from weightlifters to gymnasts,use to absorb sweat from their hands.It's especially crucial in rock climbing,as you can imagine reducing sweat,increasing friction,and generally making things less slippery is pretty important when you're a few hundred feet off the ground—probably even more important at 15 feet,for that matter.Moisture condition apparatus MatestMoisture condition value (MCV) and chalk crushing value (CCV) This apparatus is used to measure the minimum comparative effort required to produce near full compaction of a soil,and the rate at which a sample of chalk lumps are crushed.The unit can be used to classify chalk as a fill material with saturated moisture content.
