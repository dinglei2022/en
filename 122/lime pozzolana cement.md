## History of cement
The Romans found that a cement could be made which set under water and this was used for the construction of harbours.This cement was made by adding crushed volcanic ash to lime and was later called a &quotpozzolanic&quot cement,named after the village of Pozzuoli near Vesuvius.Lime (material) WikipediaSelenitic lime,also known as Scotts' cement after Henry Young Darracott Scott is a cement of grey chalk or similar lime,such as in the Lias Group,with about 5% added gypsum plaster (calcined gypsum).Selenite is a type of gypsum,but selenitic cement may be made using any form of sulfate or sulfuric acid.
