## 5 Aggregate Production
With the exception of slag and other manufactured aggregates most materials for aggregate production come from bedrock or unconsolidated deposits.The vast majority of materials used in the mineral aggregate industry are obtained from surface mined stone quarries or from sand and gravel pits.How materials are extracted influences their quality.Crushed Stone Lehigh Hanson,Inc.The remainder is sandstone,quartzite and other types of rock.It is produced by crushing quarried rock,then screening it to sizes appropriate for the intended use.Limestone is the most common used crushed stone because it’s widely available and suitable for many different applications.
