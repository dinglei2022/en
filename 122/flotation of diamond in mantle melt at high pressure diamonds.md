## Flotation of Diamond in Mantle Melt at High Pressure
Experiments show that diamond floats in a primitive mantle melt at around 20 gigapascals and 2360^circC and in a melt formed by partial melting of the transition zone at about 16 gigapascals and 2270^circC.These observations constrain magma densities at high pressure.Flotation of olivine and diamond in mantle melt at highThe density relation between diamond,the mantle minerals,and the melt suggests a possibility for accumulation of diamond in the transition zone.Recent discovery of the highpressure minerals as inclusions in diamond may be consistent with the present model of accumulation of diamond in the deep mantle.
