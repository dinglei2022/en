## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores
The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different chemistries of the ore.Copper oxides are more abundant near the surface,but are considered lowgrade ore,with a lower concentration of copper.Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores …Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.
