## Potash Mining SpringerLink
Abstract.The mining of large underground potash deposits presents an unusual challenge because the quantity of ore to be mined is very large,the value of the ore is relatively low,there is extreme competition,and most dominately,at the depth of many potash mines there are severe stress and creep (plastic flow) problems.Flotation Reagents19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This data on chemicals,and mixtures of chemicals,commonly known as reagents,is presented for the purpose of acquainting those interested in froth flotation with some of the more common reagents and their various uses.Flotation as a concentration process has been extensively used for a number of years.However,little is known of it as an exact science,although,various investigators …
