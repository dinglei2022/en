## How to Prepare a Science Fair Journal or Log Book
Aug 30,2010&nbsp&#0183&#32The first step in starting a science fair project is to create a science journal,which is a written record showing all your work from start to the finish.Take pictures during each step of the project.A science fair project is for learning more about science and you learn more if you enjoy your work.So in addition to the photographs that can8th Grade Science Fair Project Ideas8th grade science fair projects tend to involve the scientific method and designing an experiment and not making models or explaining processes.You'll be expected to present data in the form of tables and graphs.Typed reports and posters are the norm (sorry,no handwritten text).You should do the project yourself,rather than enlist heavyduty help from a parent or older student.

## Abstract Stephen H.
The Science Buddies website has a similar project in which college students participated in a contest to determine which type of building would withstand the force of the shake table better.These college students did a much more advanced experiment with a large shake table and with a dozen Lego towers at different base sizes.@ Best 72+ Trash Science Fair Projects Sign Up For FREEFriday 20191101 17:31:47 pm : The Best Trash Science Fair Projects Free Download.Find the right plan for your next woodworking project.Taken from past issues of our Magazine.Unique Modern Farmhouse Plans Hope+Chest+Wood+Plans

## Earthquake Resistant Design (Shake It Up) Science Fair
A shake table shakes the house from the ground which doesn't account for the wind or the movement above the ground.So while I do feel this experiment was useful I do feel it would've turned out better had there been an alternative way mimicking an earthquake.For my science fair project I decided to put house designs to the test to seeScience Projects to Make a Model of an Earthquake ProofScience Fair Project Ideas for Kids,Pulling on the top layer of the shake table will reenact an earthquake effect on the building.Each tower is tested.An accompanying journal should record each tower height and whether it endured the earthquake.References.
