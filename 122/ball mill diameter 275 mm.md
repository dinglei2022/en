In Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize “just in case”.Well,this saMixer Mill MM 500The robust high performance drive makes the mill suitable for long term grinding processes up to 99 hours.Hence,the MM 500 is the first mixer mill in the market to provide a real alternative to grinding in a planetary ball mill with more comfortable handling and less warming effects.
