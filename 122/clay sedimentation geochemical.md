## GEOCHEMICAL RECORDS OF A BENTONITIC ACID …
A detailed stratigraphic and facies reconstruction of a bentonitized acid tuff succession,deposited within the transgressive systems tract of the Upper Miocene Sarmatian Ser eustatic cycle,at Saj&#243;b&#225;bony,northern Hungary,was performed via petrographic,mineralogical and geochemical analyses.The purpose of the work was to analyze the degree of alteration of the volcanogenic sediments.Discussion on mineralogy and geochemistry of the …B.Jones writes: In an interesting paper Norry et al.1994 described the geochemistry and mineralogy of the Peterborough Member of the Oxford Clay Formation from the UK Jurassic.A significant part of this work concerns the relationships between the 36 major.

## Late Jurassic Sedimentation in the BorealTethyan Seaway
Climate exerts a strong influence on sedimentation.Understanding the processes behind the spatial and temporal heterogeneities in sedimentary successions can,therefore,be used to reconstruct climate processes in the geological past.Deposited across &gt1000 km in northwest Europe in the shallow (&lt 200 m),epicontinental Laurasian Seaway,the Kimmeridge Clay Formation provides an exceptionalEnvironmental Characteristics of Clays and Clay …This property of clay is used by the paint industry to disperse pigment (color) evenly throughout a paint.Without clay to act as a carrier,it would be difficult to evenly mix the paint base and color pigment.A mixture of a lot of clay and a little water results in a mud that can be …
