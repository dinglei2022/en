## Discussion and Conclusion seperation of a mixture
Discussion and Conclusion This form of physical separation works because even though the components are mixed together,they retain their own characteristics,so iron remained magnetic even though it was a part of the mixture.Another method of physical separation that we used to separate the sand,salt,and iron mixture was filtration.Magnetic separation WikipediaMagnetic separation is a process in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force.This separation technique can.
