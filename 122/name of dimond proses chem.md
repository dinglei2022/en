## Solvay process Wikipedia
The Solvay process or ammoniasoda process is the major industrial process for the production of sodium carbonate (soda ash,Na 2 CO 3).The ammoniasoda process was developed into its modern form by Ernest Solvay during the 1860s.The ingredients for this are readily available and inexpensive: salt brine (from inland sources or from the sea) and limestone (from quarries).How Are Colored Diamonds Made? Natural &amp TreatedWhat are Colored Diamonds? Natural Colored diamonds are created in the same fashion,with one unique difference.When foreign particulates are trapped during the crystallization process from which diamonds are formed,it effects and alters the chemical process and thus,changes the outcome.
