tion of basalt in hydraulic transportation of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of highly abrasive materials such as cinder and ashes from heating plants and power stations to sludge beds with sixty years of experience shows that the lifespan of basalt in the sewer systems will be 200 years and more even under extreme conditions.Navrattan USA Inc.Basalt Rebar ProcessBasalt is used in construction (e.g.as building blocks or in the groundwork),making cobblestones (from columnar basalt) and in making statues.Heating and extruding basalt yields stone wool said to be an excellent thermal insulator.Navrattan USA Inc.is actively involved in the Basalt Rebar process.Basalt comes from lava.
