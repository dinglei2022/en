## Hematite and Pyrite
Hematite forms in the rhombohedral crystal system,which is the same crystal structure as sapphire and ruby.Hematite is always opaque and is typically a blackish grey.It is commonly cut as cabochons,faceted or sold in the form of engravings,which are particularly popular.Hematite was a traditional material for signet rings.Mineralogy: magnetite &amp; hematite minerals of the week #2 Life in.28 Feb 2011.The first mineral on our tour was quartz.Most weeks,we&#39;ll only cover one mineral,but there was a very strong push to include magnetite &amp; hematite when I polled the blogosphere,so I chose to add both.Both magnetite (Fe3O4) &amp; hematite (Fe2O3) are iron oxides.However,the oxidation state of iron…
