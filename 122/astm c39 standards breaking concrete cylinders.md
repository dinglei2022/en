ASTM C39 C39M,Section 73 provides allowable tolerances to the time to conduct the strength test; for 7 days the standard states &#177; 6 hours or 36% It should be noted if your sampling is to be made from concrete cores cut from the cast concrete all the required date information of the sample is stated within ASTM C42 C42M section 710Strength Testing of Hardened Concrete Concrete,Testing compressive strength of concrete by casting cylinders and flexual strength using beams,The individuals performing these tests should be qualified and have the appropriate certifications called for in the ASTM standard test methods Test cylinders,(ASTM C39) or instrumented and tested for Modulus of Elasticity and Poisson’s.
