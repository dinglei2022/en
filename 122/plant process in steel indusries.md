## History of the steel industry (1850 1970) Wikipedia
Technology.Steel is an alloy composed of between 0.2 and 2.0 percent carbon,with the balance being iron.From prehistory through the creation of the blast furnace,iron was produced from iron ore as wrought iron,99.82 100 percent Fe,and the process of making steel involved adding carbon to iron,usually in a serendipitous manner,in the forge,or via the cementation process.Maintenance of Steel Plants Steel IndustryPlant maintenance ultimate motto is to create a productive working environment that ensures workers safety too.The ways to maintain plants or facilities are often different types.Steel mills have different machinery,setting and layout,which demand a total different maintenance ways and procedure compared to other industries.
