## Soil resistivity Wikipedia
The SI unit of resistivity is the Ohm meter (Ω m); in the United States the Ohm centimeter (Ω cm) is often used instead One Ω m is 100 Ω cm,Soil resistivity is one of the driving factors determining the corrosiveness of soilAGGREGATES (FOR OAHU & MAUI)SECTION 703 AGGREGATES Make the following amendments to said Section: (I) Amend,the material shall have a field resistivity of more than 500 ohm centimeters and pH value within the range of 55 and 90 (C) Bed Course Material for Crushed Rock Cradle,Bed course material for crushed rock cradle shall be crushed durable lava rock
