## Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) and Boiling Water
There are many different reactor types used in nuclear power plants worldwide to create nuclear energy.Two of the most common reactors are Pressurized Water Reactors and Boiling Water Reactors,both of which are light water reactors (LWR).Light water reactors use ordinary water toPressurised Water Reactor VS Boiling Water ReactorBoth Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR) and Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) use enriched Uranium as fuel and water as both coolant and moderator,to slow down neutrons.The major difference between these two types of reactors is PWR has water at over 300&#176C under pressure in its primary cooling heat transfer circuit,and generates steam in a secondary
