Taking Air Samples For Mold Testing: Settle Plate Method.Jackson Kung'u.A number of methods can be used to test air for mold or other microbial contamination.One of the oldest methods of testing air for microbial contamination is the settle plates method.This allows mold spores and fragments to settle onto agar media by gravity.Mold4.Physical removal processes: sedimentation and filtrationreductions by plain sedimentation or gravity settling are often low and inconsistent.Overall reductions of viruses and bacteria by sedimentation rarely exceed 90%,but reductions of helminth ova and some protozoans can exceed 90%,especially with longer storage times of 1 2 days.

## ASTM C 92(2007)
ASTM C 92(2007) Standard Test Method for Particle Size Distribution of Alumina or Quartz by X Ray Monitoring of Gravity Sedimentation 1.1 This test method covers the determination of the particle size distribution of alumina or quartz powders in the range from.Evaluating sedimentation problems in activated sludge.Consequently,monitoring of sludge properties and controlling of operational parameters in WWTPs with complete SRT is a necessity in order to avoid sedimentation problems.The target of this work is the study of sedimentation problems occurring because of the increase in MLSS concentration towards the goal of zero net biomass production.
