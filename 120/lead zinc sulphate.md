Lead and Zinc Lead and zinc ores are usually found together with gold and silver.A leadzinc ore may also contain lead sulfide,zinc sulfide,iron sulfide,iron carbonate,and quartz.When zinc and lead sulfides are present in profitable amounts they are regarded as ore minerals.The remaining rock and minerals are called gangue.The World's Biggest Zinc Producers thebalanceJun 25,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32The company refined 610,000 tons of zinc in 2017,or about eight percent of global zinc production when including its sister company and subsidiary.The appliions for zinc include autos,galvanized steel,and machine parts.Besides zinc,Korea Zinc is also a major refiner of lead,copper,gold,indium,nickel,bismuth,gallium,and cadmium.
