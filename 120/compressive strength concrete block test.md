## Properties of Concrete Blocks — Strength
Actual tests of compression strength of hollow concrete blocks are difficult to make,because it is almost impossible to apply the load uniformly over the whole surface,and also because a block 16 inches long and 8 inches wide will bear a load of 150,000 to 200,000 pounds,or more than the capacity of any but the largest testing machinTesting of Concrete Masonry Blocks for CompressiveCompressive strength of concrete Blocks or concrete masonry of unit will give the compressive strength of block.Similarly,test the remaining 7 blocks and

## Standard Test Method for Compressive Strength of,
51 Care must be exercised in the interpretation of the significance of compressive strength determinations by this test method since strength is not a fundamental or intrinsic property of concrete made from given materials Values obtained will depend on the size and shape of the specimen,batching,mixing procedures,the methods of sampling,molding,and fabrication and the age,Testing of Concrete Blocks Civil EngineeringTESTING BLOCKS FOR COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH COMPRESSIN TESTING MACHINE (CTM) The compression testing machine should be as per IS : 516 1959 and IS : 14858 2000 The load capacity,platens sizes,vertical space between platens and horizontal space between machine columns shall be as per the requirements of the specimens to be tested

## Civil Engineering: Compressive strength of concrete cube TEST
Test for compressive strength is carried out either on cube or cylinder Various standard codes recommend concrete cylinder or concrete cube as the standard specimen for the test American Society for Testing Materials ASTM C39 C39M provides Standard Test Method for Compressive Strength of Cylindrical Concrete SpecimensTech Talk: Recent Changes to ASTM Standards and Code for,Whether you realize it or not,the concrete block you are using is stronger than it was a few years ago! The National Concrete Masonry Association (NCMA) conducted an extensive test program of modern concrete block assemblies,and determined that the unit compressive strength properties that have been in the Code for decades were based on more variable test methods from the 1950’s through.
