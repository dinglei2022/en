## Magnetic Separator Testing: Pull Test Or Gauss Test?
testing is incredibly accurate That’s why manufacturers of magnetic separation Magnetic Separator Testing: Pull Test Or Gauss Test? Gauss testing is extremely accurate in clinical environments,where the working air gap can be plotted and the probe placed repeatedly in the exact same spot within the gapMagnetic separation WikipediaMagnetic Separation Magnetic separation takes advantage of differences in the magnetic properties of minerals Minerals fall into one of three magnetic properties: ferromagnetic,paramagnetic and diamagnetic,Varying the strength of the magnetic field and or slope of the separation trough is used to separate minerals All forms of mineral.
