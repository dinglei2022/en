## Appalachian Coal Ash Richest in Rare Earth Elements Duke
May 27,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32A study of the content of rare earth elements in U.S.coal ashes shows that coal mined from the Appalachian Mountains could be the proverbial golden goose for hardtofind materials critical to clean energy and other emerging technologies.Kids science: Elements duckstersOne example of this is carbon.Depending on how carbon atoms fit together they can form diamond,coal,or graphite.How many elements are there? There are currently 118 known elements.Of these,only 94 are thought to naturally exist on Earth.Families of Elements Elements are sometimes grouped together because they have similar properties.

## Heavy metals and coal SourceWatch
Heavy metal refers to any metallic chemical element that has a high density and is toxic or poisonous at low concentrations.Coal contains many heavy metals,as it is created through compressed organic matter containing virtually every element in the periodic table mainly carbon,but also heavy metals.Coal EncyclopediaCoal [1] Coal is a naturally occurring combustible material consisting primarily of the element carbon.It also contains low percentages of solid,liquid,and gaseous hydrocarbons and or other materials,such as compounds of nitrogen and sulfur.

## How Do Elements of Coal Ash Affect Human Health? North
Since February,when a leak from a coal ash pond near Eden spilled tens of thousands of tons of the waste into the Dan River,there's been a lot of talk about the toxins in coal ash.We assume that water exposed to coal ash is unsafe to drink unless treated,but why? What are those elements,and how,exactly,do they affect the health of humans?What element is coal answersCoal is definitely not an element.Nor is coal a compound.Coal is a mixture.It is composed of compounds of carbon and hydrogen mainly.Coal is the remains of dead plant life
