## Ball mill Wikipedia
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.Strain Anisotropy in Freestanding Germanium Nanoparticles.freestanding Ge nanoparticles (NPs) down to ∼7 nm using ball milling.Keywords: Ge Nanoparticle,Strain Anisotropy,Ball Milling,Microstructure,XRD Line.
