## Weakly magnetic iron ore beneficiation technologyOre
2,multimetalcontaining weakly magnetic iron ore,mainly hydrothermal and sedimentary phosphorus or vulcanized Wo of hematite iron ore or turbot.Such ores typically use the gravity separation,flotation,strong magnetic separation or joint process to recycle iron minerals,phosphorus or sulfur recovery use flotation process.Beneficiation studies of tungsten ores A review.Scheelite (CaWO 4) and wolframite ((Fe,Mn)WO 4) are the only tungsten minerals mined commercially and are mainly found in five types of deposits: skarn,vein stockwork,porphyry,disseminated and stratabound.Gravity concentration and flotation are the beneficiation techniques most commonly applied to scheelite ore,and gravity and or magnetic separation for wolframite ore.
