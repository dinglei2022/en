## How stainless steel is made material,manufacture,used
Stainless steel is an ironcontaining alloy—a substance made up of two or more chemical elements—used in a wide range of appliions.It has excellent resistance to stain or rust due to its chromium content,usually from 12 to 20 percent of the alloy.There are more than 57 stainless steelsMetal spinning versus flow forming The FABRICATOROct 27,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32In fact,flow forming can be considered to be a specialized kind of spinning process.Both metal spinning and flow forming can make workpieces from just a few inches in diameter up to several feet in diameter and lengths.Flow forming today produces parts for the nuclear,oil and gas,chemical,and medical industries,among others.
