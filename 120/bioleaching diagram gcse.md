## GCSE (91) Chemistry Pearson qualifiions
The Pearson Edexcel Level 1 Level 2 GCSE (91) in Chemistry is designed for use in schools and colleges.It is part of a suite of GCSE qualifiions offered by Pearson.These sample assessment materials have been developed to support this qualifiion and will be used as the benchmark to develop the assessment students will take.GCSE CHEMISTRY Extraction of Copper ThermalBioleaching and phytomining are increasingly used to extract copper from low grade ores (see below).The traditional method of extraction is to heat the copper sulfide.Copper(II) sulfide gives copper and sulfur dioxide during thermal decomposition.Thermal decomposition means that the compound breaks down into other substances when it is heated.
