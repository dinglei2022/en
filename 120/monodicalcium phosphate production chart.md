## Monocalcium phosphate Wikipedia
Monocalcium phosphate is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2 ("AMCP" or "CMP A" for anhydrous monocalcium phosphate) It is commonly found as the monohydrate ("MCP" or "MCP M"),Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2 H 2 O Both salts are colourless solids They are used mainly as superphosphate fertilizers and are also popular leavening agentsPrecaecal phosphorus digestibility of inorganic phosphate,May 08,2018&#0183;&#32;Precaecal digestibility (%) of P (pcdP%) and Ca (pcdCa%) of monocalcium phosphate (MCP),monodicalcium phosphate (MDCP),dicalcium phosphate (DCP) and defluorinated phosphate (DFP),determined in broilers at 27 d of age In Table 8,the pcdP digestibility values for the 4 test products are presented
