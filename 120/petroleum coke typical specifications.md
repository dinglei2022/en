b) Petroleum Coke (or Pet Coke) Metallurgical Coke Metallurigical coke,also known as &quotMet&quot coke or &quotLAM&quot coke,is a carbon material manufactured by the &quotdestructive distillation&quot of various blends of bituminous coal.Met coke has a very low volatile content.However,the &quotash&quot constituents remain encapsulated in the resultant coke.TypicalDelayed coking encyclopedia article CitizendiumThe yield of coke from the delayed coking process ranges from about 18 to 30 percent by weight of the feedstock residual oil,depending the composition of the feedstock and the operating variables.Many refineries worldwide produce as much as 2,000 to 3,000 tons per day of petroleum coke and some produce even more.
