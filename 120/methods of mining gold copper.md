The four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining,concentrating,smelting,and refining.In a few instances,however,leaching takes the place of concentrating,smelting,and refining.At present,although considerable leaching and directsmelting ores are produced,the bulk of the copper ore mined is concentrated.The milling of copper ores as practiced in the largerMining Techniques of the Sierra Nevada and GoldMining Techniques of the Sierra Nevada and Gold Hydraulic mining was a potentially efficient method of getting mercurycovered copper plates trapped the gold.
