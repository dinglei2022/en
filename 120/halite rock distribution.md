The Middle Devonian Lucas Formation represents a major evaporitic sequence of dolomite,anhydrite,and halite in Michigan (Fig.1).The thicknesses of the major evaporitic cycles range from 3 to 150 feet most are between 5 and 30 feet.Rock textures associated with these rocks are also cyclic in vertical distribution.Composition of the crust Chemical elements,Minerals,RocksThe crust is compositionally distinct outermost rocky layer of the Earth.What is the crust made of? The answer to this question depends on whether we want to know which chemical elements,minerals or rock types it is made of.It may be surprising but about a dozen chemical elements,minerals,or rock types is all that it takes to describe approximately 99% of the crust.
