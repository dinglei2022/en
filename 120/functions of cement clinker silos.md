## Cement clinker Wikipedia
Gypsum is added to clinker primarily as an additive preventing the flash settings of the cement,but it is also very effective to facilitate the grinding of clinker by preventing agglomeration and coating of the powder at the surface of balls and mill wall Organic compounds are also often added as grinding aids to avoid powder agglomerationSteps of Cement Production Process Flyer Cement SiloSteps of Cement Production Process.Cement is one of the most common and important building materials.It is a very critical ingredient because only cement has the ability to increase the viscosity of concrete,which in turn provides the ability to lock sand and gravel together in concrete mixtures.
