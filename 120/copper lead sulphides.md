## Copper ores Danafloat Home
A typical copper sulphide ore contains various levels of iron sulphide types that generally include pyrite (FeS2) and pyrrhotite (Fe1xS).Often gold and silver are present which may either be associated with the sulphides or are free.The gangue particles can consist of aLead Sulfide Definition of Lead Sulfide by MerriamWebsterLead sulfide definition is an insoluble black compound PbS that occurs naturally as galena and is used in photoconductive cells.an insoluble black compound PbS that occurs naturally as galena and is used in photoconductive cells See the full definition.SINCE 1828.Menu.JOIN MWU

## Bearing Damage: Corrosion waukbearing
Removal of overlays by abrasive wear or scoring by dirt exposes the underlying lead in copperlead or leadbronze bearings to attack,while in severe cases the overlays may be corroded.Hydrogen sulphide in the oil attacks the copper in coppercontaining alloys,including tinbased whitemetal.Appliions: Copper Compounds Copper Sulphate's Role inAs copper sulphate contains 25% copper metal,the copper content of a 1% Bordeaux mixture would be 025 % copper.The quantity of lime used can be reduced considerably.Actually 1 kg copper sulphate requires only 0.225 kg of chemically pure hydrated lime to precipitate all the copper.

## Appliions: Copper Compounds Copper Sulphate
Uses of Copper Compounds: Copper Sulphate.Copper sulphate,blue stone,blue vitriol are all common names for pentahydrated cupric sulphate,Cu S04 5 H20,which is the best known and the most widely used of the copper salts.Indeed it is often the starting raw material for the production of many of the other copper salts.Sulfide precipitation of heavy metals nepis.epa.govA fullscale sulfide precipitation process (Na2S as sulfide source) with a capacity of 1.0 x 106 gallons per day is operating at Boliden Metall Corporation of Sweden to treat smelter (Cu,Pb,Zn smelting) wastewaters.One copper smelter in Japan has a sulfide precipitation process to recover heavy metals as sulfides.

Sulphide is an alternative form of sulfide.As nouns the difference between sulphide and sulfide is that sulphide is while sulfide is (chemistry) any compound of sulfur and a metal or other electropositive element or group.Copper(II) sulfide CuS PubChemGroups of 3032 rats were given single im injections containing 20 mg of cupric oxide (16 mg copper),cupric sulfide (13.3 mg copper),and cuprous sulfide (16 mg copper) into the left and the right thigh of each rat.All animals were observed for up to 20 months,
