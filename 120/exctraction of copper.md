## Extraction of copper (P 2) Unacademy
yes agree with u worst explanation in all the vedios.i am just seeing lectures in order to get notes.btw the notes r just awesome.sir not even translating the mateer into hindi.just reading the notes.not explaining a single thing.worst learning experienceSolvent Extraction of Copper Using TBP,D2EHPA and MIBKJan 29,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Abstract.In this research,a synergetic system of solvent extraction process was developed to recover copper from aqueous solutions with trinbutyl phosphate (TBP),di2ethyl hexyl phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) and methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK).

## SX Solvent Extraction of Metals: A Design Manual
Copper Recovery by Solvent Extraction.A common method of copper recovery from oxide ores is dump leaching in which the excavated ore is crushed and dumped on an impervious surface in "lifts" of anything from 10 to 100 ft deep.Sulphuric acid is sprayed onto the levelled off dump via a network of pipes designed to give even distribution.GCSE CHEMISTRY Extraction of Copper ThermalExtraction of Metals.Extraction of Copper.Copper is sometimes found as native metal.Copper ores include copper(II) oxide and copper(II) sulfide.Copper(II) oxide can be reduced by reaction with carbon.Some copper ores may contain only small amounts of copper.These are called low grade ores and have less than 1% copper but they are still used because copper is so valuable.
