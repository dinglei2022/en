## How do I explain this problem? Centripetal Centrifugal force!
The purpose of a spin cycle of a washing machine is to remove water from clothes.The drum of radius,r,rotating with speed,v,will have a centripetal acceleration which is provided by a centripetal force,acting toward the centre of the drum,which in turn has an equal and opposite reaction (centrifugal?) force.Centripetal Force Washing Machine Physics ForumsAug 19,2015&nbsp&#0183&#32I know that the centripetal force is the resultant force which points to the center.So in the case of a washing machine,what force pushes the clothes and water to the outer edge? There is not centrifugal force,but then how come all the clothes

Oh God you said &quotexcreting&quot ahhaahhaaha like your washing machine is just shitting gforces,that&#39s hilarious.So assume your washer has a 0.5 m diameter chamber,so r=0.25 m.Your centripetal acceleration is a = w^2 r.where w is your angular velocity,which is 1200 rpm = 125.7 rad s.Therefore,a=3950&nbspcentripetal force and centrifugal force facts,information,picturesCENTRIPETAL FORCE.CONCEPT.Most people have heard of centripetal and centrifugal force.Though it may be somewhat difficult to keep track of which is which,chances are anyone who has heard of the two concepts remembers that one is the tendency of objects in rotation to move inward,and the other is the&nbsp

Nov 23,2013 One could think &quotwell,there is clearly some kind of centrifugal force pushing the clothes against the walls of the washing machine&quot.However,as we have seen above,this is wrong! In fact,the force acting on each set of clothes must point to the center of the machine.But then who is providing this force?How many G&#39s does my laundry pull during the spin cycle? TheAug 13,2002 How many gees does my laundry pull when the washing machine goes into its spincycle? The force my laundry experiences is equivalent to the centripetal force required to spin it in a circle,and from our elementary physics we know that centripetal force is mw^2r,where m is the mass of the laundry,w is&nbsp
