## Sphalerite: Mineral information,data and localities.
Sphalerite,also known as blende or zinc blende,is the major ore of zinc.When pure (with little or no iron) it forms clear crystals with colours ranging from pale yellow (known as Cleiophane) to orange and red shades (known as Ruby Blende),but as iron content increases it forms dark,opaque metallic crystals (known as Marmatite).ZincZinc occurs as the sulfide (ZnS) in the mineral known as zinc blende or sphalerite.These minerals are usually mixed with ores containing lead or copper.Pine Point mine in the Northwest Territories produces a lead zinc ore.Sherritt Gordon mines at Lynn Lake,Manitoba produce copper zinc ore.

Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes.The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende),a zinc sulfide mineral.The largest workable lodes are in Australia,Asia,and the United States.Zinc is refined by froth flotation ofHow lead is made material,used,processing,productOver 95% of all lead mined is derived from one of these three minerals.However,most deposits of these ores are not found alone but mixed with other minerals such as pyrite,marcasite,and zinc blende.Therefore much lead ore is obtained as a byproduct of other metal mining,usually zinc or silver.
