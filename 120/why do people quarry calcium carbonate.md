## Calcium Carbonate Vs.Calcium Citrate: Which Is Better For
The two major forms of calcium are calcium carbonate and calcium citrate.Calcium supplements are intended to be consumed with a meal,and when taken as directed,the two forms of calcium are absorbed at roughly the same rate.However,when taken on an empty stomach,the body has a much easier time absorbing calcium in its citrate form vs.its carbonate form.Limestone,pH and calcium7&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The effective calcium carbonate equivalent (ECCE) is a measure of the limestone’s effectiveness and is based on the combined effect of chemical purity (CCE),fineness of grind and moisture content.Table 1 shows limestone effectiveness based on being ground and sieved through different sized mesh screens.
