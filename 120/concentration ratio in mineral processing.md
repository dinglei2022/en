## Mineral processing Wikipedia
In case of mineral processing,concentration means the increase of the percentage of the valuable mineral in the concentrate Gravity concentration Gravity separation is the separation of two or more minerals of different specific gravity by their relative movement in response to the force of gravity and one or more other forces (such as.Mineral Processing DECHEMAmixture into concentrate (high ratio of the value mineral) and gangue The yield and concentration of the value min eral are key criteria for production of the concentrate The efficiency and selectivity of the sorting process determine 2 Processing Technology for Primary Resources Fig 2: Schematic representation of mineral processing The.
