## Borax Wikipedia
In artisanal gold mining,borax is sometimes used as part of a process (as a flux) meant to eliminate the need for toxic mercury in the gold extraction process,although it cannot directly replace mercury.Borax was reportedly used by gold miners in parts of the Philippines in the 1900s.Testing Local Conditions for the Introduction of a2016620&ensp&#0183&enspto introduce mercuryfree gold extraction techniques in Kadoma and other gold mining areas in Zimbabwe and globally.Objectives.A successful introduction of the borax method depends on the local conditions and has been shown in previous studies.7,11,12,15,16,19.Therefore,the objective of the project was to test if gold extraction using borax
