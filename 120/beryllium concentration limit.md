## OSHA Proposes New Beryllium Regulations Code Red Safety
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has scheduled a public hearing to discuss the agency's proposed rule to amend its existing exposure limits to Beryllium.Currently,OSHA's eighthour permissible exposure limit for Beryllium is 2.0 micrograms per cubic meter of air,but the new rule will change that number to.2 micrograms per cubic meter of air.US Department of Labor Issues Final Rule to LowerJan 06,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32The final rule will reduce the eighthour permissible exposure limit from the previous level of 2.0 micrograms per cubic meter to 0.2 micrograms per cubic meter.Above that level,employers must take steps to reduce the airborne concentration of beryllium.The rule requires additional protections,including personal protective equipment,medical exams,other medical surveillance and training

## Determination of beryllium concentrations in UK ambient
The mean beryllium concentration found in PM 10 was 0.05 ng m −3,with individual results ranging from 0.01 to 0.15 ng m −3 approaching the 0.2 ng m −3 limit recommended by EPAQs (EPAQs,2008).To the best of the authors' knowledge,this is the only example of actual measurements of beryllium in UK ambient air to date.A Medley of Potpourri: BerylliumMar 06,2015&nbsp&#0183&#32The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline,allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace.Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration.

In most natural waters,the majority of beryllium will be adsorbed to suspended matter or in sediment,rather than dissolved.For example,in the Great Lakes in the United States of America (USA),beryllium is present in sediment at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than its concentration in water.Beryllium in sediment isFrequently Asked Questions for the Impact to Ground WaterIf a total soil concentration result is ND,SPLP calculation cannot be conducted on that sample,because the sample is uncontaminated.Contaminated soil needs to be sampled and tested.If a leachate concentration is ND,this result can still be used in SPLP options 1 and 2.You would enter the aqueous reporting limit as the leachate concentration.
