Concrete Materials Calculators easy to use metric calculators for working out the cement,sand,gravel or allin ballast required for concrete.Ratio of Steel required to Cement Concrete Shyam SteelThe ratio means for every 130 kg concrete 100 kg of steel is needed 100 kg of steel strengthen the structure in RCC Failing this ratio of steel to concrete would cause weakening the structure and fatal cracks to it Based on the construction type ratio of TMT Steel Bar to Concrete is: Civil Construction Heavy Industrial Construction = 130 kg m3

## Concrete mix ratio for various grades of concrete,
Dec 08,2017&#0183;&#32;This paste is also called as concrete The strength of this concrete mix is determined by the proportion on which these cement,sand,stones or aggregates are mixed There are various grades of concrete available in the market based on these ratios Some of them are: M10,M20,M30,M35,etc So,what really does M10 or M20 mean or representWhat are the cement sand aggregate ratios for M20 M10 M15,The ratios of cement to sand to aggregate for the different grades of concrete are as follows,Mix ratio for M10 concrete is 1:3:6 compressive strength is 10N mm2 @ 28 days 1 part of cement.
