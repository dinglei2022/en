## Difference Between Density and Specific Gravity
Apr 23,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Both density and specific gravity describe mass and may be used to compare different substances.They are not,however,identical measures.Specific gravity is an expression of density in relation to the density of a standard or reference (usually water).Bulk Specific Gravity Pavement InteractiveOverview.The bulk specific gravity test is used to determine the specific gravity of a compacted HMA sample by determining the ratio of its weight to the weight of an equal volume of water.The bulk specific gravity test measures a HMA sample's weight under three different conditions (Figure 1):

## What is specific gravity? Definition from WhatIs
The term specific gravity,symbolized sp gr,refers to the ratio of the density of a solid or liquid to the density of water at 4 degrees Celsius.The term can also refer to the ratio of the density of a gas to the density of dry air at standard temperature and pressure,although this specifiion is less often used.What Is Specific Gravity? wisegeekJun 14,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Specific gravity usually refers to a material's density when compared to the density of water.This number is given as a ratio which means that there are no units when discussing it.By using a known specific gravity for a particular substance,it is possible to determine what a a sample of the substance is pure or how concentrated it is.

## Specific Gravity The Wood Database
In my experience,specific gravity is without a doubt the single most abused and vaguely used term in woodworking terminology.Technically,specific gravity is a measure of the ratio of a wood's density as compared to water.(So if a wood is of the same density as water,the specific gravity would be 1.00.)3 Ways to Test the Specific Gravity of Liquids wikiHowJun 17,2015&nbsp&#0183&#32To test the specific gravity of liquids,first pour a sample of liquid into a container.You'll need to use a container that is deep enough to allow a hydrometer to float.Next,make sure the liquid is the same temperature that the hydrometer is calibrated to,or you will get an incorrect reading.
