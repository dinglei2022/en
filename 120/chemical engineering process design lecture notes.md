The following requirements are looked for: No change due to disturbance of the soil structure,No change in void ratio and water content,No change in constituents and chemical properties.4 Requirement of good sampling process Inside clearance ratio The soil is under great stress as it enters the sampler and has a tendency to laterally expand.METHODS FOR MODELLING UNIT OPERATIONS IN2013328&ensp&#0183&enspHence,when a design in chemical process engineering has to be tested,a manner of testing has to be used that can take a lot of different factors into account and is relatively inexpensive [1].Therefore,when the design of for example a chemical plant has to be evaluated,this is done with the help of systematic computerbased methods.
