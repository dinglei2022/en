## What is the function of the economizer?
The economizer is a heat exchanger equipment which utilizes heat recovery of flue gases to heat feedwater.It can increase boiler efficiency,reduce the temperature of flue gas and save the fuel by absorbing recovery of flue gases.Besides,the feedwater is heated.Industrial boiler technology for beginnersIndustrial boiler systems can cope with much higher pressures than pressure cookers.These boilers are welded from thick steel plates that are up to 35 mm thick,making pressures of 30 bar and more possible.A stable,robust design is also essential if a.
