## NaturesRainbows Fluorescent Minerals,Rocks
Fluorescent minerals are often called &quotGlow Rocks&quot.They glow,or fluoresce,under ultraviolet light and emit longer wavelength visible light (Stoke's shift).Invisible UV light from ordinary black lights,LW LEDs,or shortwave mineral lights cause this fluorescence (also called luminescence).Gypsum Encyclopedia.comgypsum (hydrated calcium sulphate,CaSO 4.2H 2 O) Most common sulphate mineral.Huge beds of gypsum occur in sedimentary rocks,where it is associated with halite.It crystallizes in the monoclinic system.Varieties are alabaster,selenite (transparent and foliated) and satinspar (silky and fibrous).It is a source of plaster of Paris.Hardness.

Gypsum is considered both a sedimentary rock and a mineral.Its chemical formula is CaSO 4 ∙2H 2 O.Because gypsum formed when ancient seas evaporated in Oklahoma during Permian time (299 251 million years ago),geologists classify it as an evaporite.Gypsum Mineral Uses and PropertiesWhat is Gypsum? Gypsum is an evaporite mineral most commonly found in layered sedimentary deposits in association with halite,anhydrite,sulfur,calcite,and dolomite.Gypsum (CaSO 4.2H 2 O) is very similar to Anhydrite (CaSO 4).The chemical difference is that gypsum contains two waters and anhydrite is without water.
