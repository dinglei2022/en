## Advantages and Disadvantages of Vertical Axis Wind Turbines
3 Dec 2011.First let&#39;s talk about the differences between these two designs.In a typical horizontally oriented design the rotor blades are situated perpendicular to the direction of the wind and the shaft of the motor is parallel to the wind.In a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT),the blades are vertical or parallel with the&nbsp;.Effect of Blade Thickness of Vertical Axis Wind Turbine on Power.power.To overcome the problem of power generation in turbulent winds,vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) were developed.In which blade is the main element.
