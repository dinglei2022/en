## Elution and Carbon Reactivation Resource book
During the CIL process,gold is leached from the ore using an alkaline cyanide solution The resulting gold cyanide complex ions are then concentrated and separated from the slurry by adsorbing onto activated carbon Elution is the next step in the process,whereby the adsorption of the gold cyanide complex onto carbon is reversedHow to Leach Gold Ore With Chlorination SciencingWhen you mix sodium chloride and hydrochloric acid together,Aerating the mixture speeds up the leaching process,&quotHow to Leach Gold Ore With Chlorination.&quot
