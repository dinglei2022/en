## Method of manufacturing cast iron MEEHANITE,
A method of producing an all pearlitic cast iron which comprises melting a charge of iron of such total carbon and silicon content that if cast in the absence of tellurium would result in a gray cast iron containing free ferrite and adding tellurium and calcium silicide in conjunction with at least one metal of the group consisting of nickel.Gray Iron Castings Iron Castings Architectural,and cast iron; sometimes called calcium silicide,core by heat treatment Case Hardening: A process of hardening a ferrous alloy so that surface layer or case is made substantially harder than the interior or core Typical case hardening processes are carburizing and quenching,cyaniding,carbonitriding,nitriding,induction hardening and.

## Effect of carbon equivalent and inoculation on residual,
In the present investigation,an attempt is made to study (i) the effect of carbon equivalent on residual stress in cast iron castings,and (ii) the effect of inoculants such as calcium silicide and ferrosilicon on residual stress in iron,A study on the oxidation characteristics of cast irons,misch metal and calcium silicide to such an alloy does not improve its oxidation resistance But aluminum cast iron develops considerable oxidation resistance only when a sufficient quantity of silicon is also present in the alloy,no C Si S P Mn A1 Treatment,addition%
