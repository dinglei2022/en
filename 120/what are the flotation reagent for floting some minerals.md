## Flotation Reagents & Collectors ArrMaz
Collectors,some of the most important flotation reagents used in the flotation process,are used to modify the surface properties of minerals A collector is a chemical that selectively binds to the surface of target minerals and imparts hydrophobicity to those mineral particles,a necessary condition for air bubble attachmentIntroduction to Mineral Processing Chevron Phillips,Introduction to Mineral Processing,Certain chemicals are even capable of depressing the flotation of minerals that are either to be recovered at a later time or are not to be recovered,and the character of the host rock are some of the many factors that influence reagent usage Water quality,flotation equipment size and type.

While some operations float at a natural pH,at least in roughing,in these cases the combination of reagent selection and relative pyrite floatability is controllable Even when neutral pH is used in roughing,the cleaner flotation stages are generally conducted at higher pH to ensure iron sulphide depressionFroth flotation an overview ScienceDirect TopicsFurther,with the emerging scarcity of fresh or clean water around the globe,the need to float minerals in highly saline waters will grow and the effects of such a water regime will need to be more clearly understood for the iron ore flotation system,especially as they relate to reagent chemistry and interactions
