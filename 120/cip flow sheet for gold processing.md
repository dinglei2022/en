CIP can be defined as circulation of cleaning liquids through machines and other equipment in a cleaning circuit.The passage of the highvelocity flow of liquids over the equipment surfaces generates a mechanical scouring effect that dislodges dirt deposits.This only applies to the flow in pipes,heat exchangers,pumps,valves,separators,etc.Gold Extraction and Recovery Processesprocess,(iii) electrowinning and (iv) ionexchange solvent extraction.Traditionally,MerrillCrowe process was used to remove gold from a cyanide solution by using zinc dust to precipitate gold from its solution.Carbon adsorption is increasing using in newer plants for gold recovery.Carbon in Pulp (CIP) technique
