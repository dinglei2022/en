Marble,granular limestone or dolomite that has been recrystallized under the influence of heat,pressure,and aqueous solutions.Commercially,it includes all decorative calciumrich rocks that can be polished,as well as certain serpentines.Classification of Metamorphic Rocks4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Classification of metamorphic rocks is based on mineral assemblage,texture,protolith,and bulk chemical composition of the rock.Each of these will be discussed in turn,then we will summarize how metamorphic rocks are classified.

## Granite College of Natural Resources,UC Berkeley
The chemical composition of granite is typically 7077% silica,1113% alumina,35% potassium oxide,35% soda,1% lime,23% total iron,and less than 1% magnesia and titania.Volcanic rock of equivalent chemical composition and mineralogy is called rhyolite.Metamorphic Rock Formation and Composition5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Formation.Metamorphic rock refers to any type of rock that is created from a change of pre existing rocks caused by changing environmental conditions,such as differences in temperature,pressure,and mechanical stress,and the addition or loss of chemical components.

## The composition of limestone What is limestone.
The chemical and physical composition of limestone.Calcite is a form of calcium carbonate with the chemical formula CaCO 3.In other words,calcite is composed of a basic structure of one atom of calcium,one atom of carbon and three atoms of oxygen.Marble: composition and origin of the name Carrara.Scientifically,marble is a carbonate rock which originated from metamorphic genesis: that means it is born from the transformation of a pre existing rock,whose composition and structure underwent changes over the time caused by the intervention of different chemical and physical factors.

## The Chemical Composition of Granite Actforlibraries
Interestingly enough,the chemical composition of granite can vary quite a bit,depending on where it is formed and the magma it was formed from.How granite is formed.Being an igneous rock,granite is formed from the solidifiion and cooling of magma.Granite6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The composition and origin of any magma that differentiates into granite leave certain petrological evidence as to what the granite's parental rock was.The final texture and composition of a granite are generally distinctive as to its parental rock.For instance,a granite that is derived from partial melting of metasedimentary rocks may have.

## Marble Wikipedia
Marble is a metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals,most commonly calcite or dolomite.Marble is typically not foliated,although there are exceptions.In geology,the term &quotmarble&quot refers to metamorphosed limestone,but its use in stonemasonry more broadly encompasses unmetamorphosed limestone.What Is the Chemical Formula for Marble? ReferenceMarble is made of calcium carbonate,CaCO3,which is also what limestone is made from.The only difference between limestone and marble is the crystalline structure.Limestone crystals are much smaller than that of marble,and limestone is much more porous.Marble and limestone are common building materials due to their durability.
