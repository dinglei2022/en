## Crushed Concrete Aggregates Properties and Uses of
Crushed concrete aggregates also called as recycled concrete aggregates are fragments and pieces of concrete buildings which are demolished or rebuild.These crushed concrete are cleaned from dirt and broken to smaller pieces to manufacture aggregate which is termed as recycled aggregateAggregates for Concrete Department of Civil EngineeringAggregates for Concrete bination of gravels or crushed stone with particles,Naturally occurring concrete aggregates are a mixture of rocks and minerals (see Table 5 1) A mineral is a natu ,Recycled concrete,or crushed waste concrete,is a
