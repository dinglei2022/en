## Solids breakage,attrition,wear,in pneumatic conveying
When a solid is conveying in a pneumatic conveying transport,some of its physical properties will most probably be affected.The most common problem observed industrially is to break the material thus change the particle size distribution PSD of the product being conveyed.Generally large particles will break when the solids is hitting theVACUMAX AeroMechanical ConveyorsThe result is less particle degradation,less conveyor wear,than with dilute pneumatic conveying.Low speed,dense phase aeroconveying further reduces particle degradation and conveyor wear by controlling the material's optimum conveying velocity.The use of

## Dilute phase vs.dense phase pneumatic conveying: What's
Jan 13,2011&nbsp&#0183&#32The conveying gas volume and velocity are sufficient to keep the material that's being transported in suspension.The material is being conveyed in a continuous manner,and is not accumulating on the bottom of the conveying line at any point.For dilute phase conveying,a relatively high conveying air velocity must be maintained.Interested In Conveying Fragile Materials? Read Our Q&ampAAnswerAny fragile material will suffer product degradation in a pneumatic conveying system.The object is to minimize the degradation as much as possible.Product degradation is caused by impacts (with bends and deflectors) and shearing caused by interaction with the walls of the pipe.
