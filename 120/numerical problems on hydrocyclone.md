## Oil water separation efficiency and fluid mechanics of a.
Oil water separation efficiency and fluid mechanics of a hydrocyclone Xiangzhong Fan1,a 1.there are many problems,such as workloads of experimental research,high cost and uncertainty on industrial amplification[6].With the rapid development of computer technology,computational fluid dynamics method has become an important means for hydrocyclone due to the high speed and low cost[7 10.Numerical Simulation of Gas Liquid Flow in HydrocycloneIn this paper,gas liquid flow in hydrocyclone was simulated with VOF model,which successfully solved a problem about sediment clearance of hydrocyclone in one steel plant.This research saved huge reconstruction investment for the plant,and reduced construction period which abated influence on production progress.

## Numerical simulation of flow in a hydrocyclone SciELO Argentina
The difficulty of finding the actual flow of the hydrocyclones makes it necessary to specify the shape and localization of the air core surface.In the usual models of flows in a hydrocyclone,the interface that bounds the air core is modeled as a fixed cylindrical surface,that simplifies the problem greatly.This approximation&nbsp;.
