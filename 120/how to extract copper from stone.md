## HISTORY OF METALLURGY History and Timelines
HISTORY OF METALLURGY including A magic material,from the Greek chalcos 'copper' and lithos 'stone'.and the smelting of mineral ores to extract metal.Extraction Of Copper Mining,Concentration,Smelting,Copper Mining: The commonest ore used in the extraction of copper is Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) also known as Copper Pyrites and other such sulphid The percentage of copper in the actual ore is too low for direct extraction of copper to be viable The concentration of ore is required and it is done by the Froth Flotation method Concentration of.

## Natural Stone Institute Remove Stains from Stone,
Copper and bronze stains appear as green or muddy brown and result from the action of moisture on nearby or embedded bronze,copper or brass items Metal stains must be removed with a poultice(See section on Making & Using a Poultice) Deep seated,rusty stains are extremely difficult to remove and the stone may be permanently stainedNew approaches for extracting and recovering metals from,15 05 2017&#0183;&#32;Copper and silver were extracted both from mineral residues and fresh mineral tailings by mixing 05 g of representative samples with 10 mL of a solution containing 342 M NaCl and 02 M HCl ( Romero et al,2003 ),and heating for 1 h at 90 &#176;C 24 Sulfidogenic bioreactors and selective recovery of copper from PLS
