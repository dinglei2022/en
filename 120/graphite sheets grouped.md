The most common is graphite,which is carbon in the form of stacked sheets.Another form of carbon is diamond,but this is relatively rare.Amorphous carbon is a third allotrope of carbon; it is a component of soot.Another allotrope of carbon is a fullerene,which has the form of sheets of carbon atoms folded into a sphere.Graphite Business experts and consultants on demandGraphite is a platform that connects you with highly vetted independent consultants for ondemand work.Leading companies leverage our platform to access hardtofind skills and expertise,add horsepower to their teams and accelerate business performance.

## Properties of solids
Examples of this type of solid are diamond and graphite,and the fullerenes.As you can see below,graphite has only 2 D hexagonal structure and therefore is not hard like diamond.The sheets of graphite are held together by only weak London forces! solid1.Metallic solids—Made up of metal atoms that are held together&nbsp;.Carbon nanotubes,science and technology part (I) structure.7 Sep 2010.Fullerenes are similar in structure to graphite,which is composed of a sheet of linked hexagonal rings,but they contain pentagonal (or sometimes heptagonal) rings that prevent the sheet from.SWCNTs are generally grouped in bundles and the interaction between the nanotubes is Van der Waals force.
