## What is Nuclear Waste? (with pictures) wisegeek
Jun 20,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Nuclear waste is the radioactive waste produced by nuclear reactors,or left over from research projects,medical uses,and the manufacture of nuclear weapons.Methods of classifiion can vary somewhat from country to country,but two egories — highlevel waste (HLW),and lowlevel waste (LLW) — are generally recognized,based on radioactivity,source and halflife.Classifiions of Nuclear Waste Institute for EnergyRadioactive Waste: In general,radioactive waste classes are based on the waste's origin,not on the physical and chemical properties of the waste that could determine its safe management.Other egories of radioactive waste not listed here include mixed waste and NARM wastes (NaturallyOccurring and AcceleratorProduced Radioactive Materials).
