## Use of phosphate rocks for sustainable agriculture
Appleton (2001) summarizes these considerations: &quotPhosphate rock is a low value,high volume commodity with high transport costs,so the economic potential of a phosphate rock deposit will be determined to a large extent by its loion in relation to domestic and international markets.Agronomic and environmental aspects of phosphateAgronomic and environmental aspects of phosphate fertilizers include directly applied phosphate rock (PR),partially acidulated PR (PAPR),and compacted mixtures of PR and WSP.The potential

## Phosphoric acid chemical compound Britannica
Pure phosphoric acid is a crystalline solid (melting point 42.35&#176 C,or 108.2&#176 F) in less concentrated form it is a colourless syrupy liquid.The crude acid is prepared from phosphate rock,while acid of higher purity is made from white phosphorus.Phosphoric acid forms three classes of salts corresponding to replacement of one,two,or three hydrogen atoms.How to Use FertilizersSoft Rock Phosphate OrganicSoft rock phosphate,also called CalPhos or colloidal phosphate,is a great source of potassium and calcium for your plants.Our CalPhos comes from phosphate rock mined in Florida,which was formed millions of years ago from the mineralized remains of marine creatures.Soft Rock Phosphate should not be confused with Hard Rock Phosphate.
