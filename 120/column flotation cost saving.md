The remaining column flotation capacity is spread over more than 60 other commoditi Flotation columns installed in the 1960s were overwhelmingly in base metals,with 45 per cent in lead,25 per cent in zinc and 20 per cent in copper operations The remaining ten per cent of flotation columns,COLUMN CELLS AS ROUGHERS Eriez Flotation DivisionOperating Cost Savings Operating cost savings can be realized from reduced power requirements,reduced maintenance costs and in some cases reduced reagent consumption Power costs are typically 50% lower than an equivalent mechanical flotation circuit Column cells have very low maintenance requirements and low inventory requirements
