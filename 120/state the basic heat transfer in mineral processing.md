If temperature of pipe is lower than surrounding air,it gains heat from it.As pipe are generally made from metals like steel,copper etc.which are very good conductor of heat,heat loss will be substantial and very costly.So it is essential to provide cover of a material which is very poor conductor of heat like mineral wool,hemp etc.APV Dryer Handbookproduct to increase the effective surface area presented to heat and mass transfer.The logical extension of this technique is total dispersion drying,i.e.flash or pneumatic dryers,fluid beds,etc.where discrete particles can be brought into contact with the hot gas.This produces rapid heat transfer with correspondingly short drying times.
