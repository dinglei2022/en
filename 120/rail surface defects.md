## Rail Surface Defect Detection Method Based on …
In order to ensure the rapid,safe and stable operation of trains,it is very important to detect the flaws on the rail surface.At present,although there are many detection methods for rail surface defects,the comprehensiveness,rapidity and accuracy of defect detection are still not satisfactory.Therefore,this paper presents a deep learning method using the YOLOv3 algorithm to realize.Eddy current testing of rails okondt20191024&ensp&#0183&enspTo solve the task of RCF defects detection two scanners are implemented in the design of the flaw detector.One scanner is designed for the Gauge corner checking detection,appearing on the gauging surface of the rail head,and the other scanner for the Running surface checking appearing on the running surface of the area concerned.

## Mechanism Analysis of Spalling Defect on Rail Surface
Under the wheel rail contact loading conditions,the microcracks on the rail surface propagate,leading to spalling defect or rail fracture and threatening the travelling safety of highspeed railway directly.In order to analyze the mechanism of the crack propagation on the rail surface,the calculation model of the wheel rail contact fatigue was established,and the variation of the stressWhat are Surface Defects?Surface defects are the boundaries,or planes,that separate a material into regions,each region having the same crystal structure but different orientations.Surface defects may cause corrosion and coating failure.The presence of surface defects can dramatically change the corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of a material.

## Rail defects: An overview Request PDF
The main causes of train derailment are related to rail defects such as head surface defects,horizontal defects,vertical longitudinal split defects,star cracks at colt holes and diagonal crackA new process for the aluminothermic weld repair of2019111&ensp&#0183&enspIsolated rail head defects formed under traffic,detected either by visual inspection or ultrasonic flaw testing,can significantly reduce the service life of rails if not managed correctly.Surface initiated defects account for approximately 50% of all defects removed from Network Rail (NR) Infrastructure.These are predominately made up of squats from rolling contact fatigue and wheelburns

Therefore,the defects are located in the near field because the distances of the defects from the rail surface (7.5 and 20 mm farthest from the surface) are less than N d of probe A,B,and C,which is about 42.85,107.80,and 215.60 mm,respectively.Guided wave inspection potential of defects in rail .29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Surface defects and shelling can render ultrasonic bulk wave inspection useless.Alternatively,guided wave methods provide wave modes that can travel great distances in rail,e.g.2130 m,and that can insonify the entire volume of a rail.
