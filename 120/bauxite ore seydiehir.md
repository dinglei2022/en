## Seydişehir mine Wikipedia
The Seydişehir mine is a large mine in the south of Turkey in Konya Province,361 km south of the capital,Ankara.Seydişehir is situated on one of the largest veins of bauxite in Turkey,with estimated reserves of 30 million tonnes of bauxite.References[edit].Jump up ^ The Middle East: a physical,social,and regional&nbsp;.Developing alternative resources of rare earth elements in Europe.a factor of two compared with the original bauxite ore [5].Bauxites and red muds from the Parnassus Ghiona region of Greece [6] and the Seydisehir Akseki region of Turkey have been assessed as part of this study.Red muds from these deposits contain on average 900 ppm REE compared with typical values of &lt;100 ppm&nbsp;.
