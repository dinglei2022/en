## Phosphate and How Florida Was Formed
Phosphate rock was first mined in England in 1847 for use as a fertilizer.It was in 1881 that Captain J.Francis LeBaron,of the Army Corps of Engineers,discovered Florida's treasure in black phosphate pebbles in the Peace River.A "hard rock" phosphate reserve inPhosphate RockPhosphate Rock.Phosphate Rock is an excellent natural source of phosphorus,calcium and many essential trace elements.It contains over 30 percent total phosphate (38 percent available) and 48 percent calcium (as CaO).Phosphate rock has approximately one fifth the neutralizing power of lime.

## When to Apply Super Phosphate to a Garden Hunker
Apr 12,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32Phosphorous fertilizers vary in their availability to plants,depending upon the phosphorous source.Sulfuricacidtreated rock phosphate creates a readily available phosphorous called super phosphate.If your garden is deficient in phosphorous,super phosphate should be applied to the garden just prior to seeding or transplanting plants.The Function Of Phosphorus In Plants And The GardenIf you would like to correct your soil's phosphorus deficiency using organic fertilizer,try using bone meal or rock phosphate.These both can help with replacing phosphorus in the soil.Sometimes,simply adding compost to the soil can help plants be better able to
