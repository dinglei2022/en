## Patent EP0229224A2 Apparatus and method for froth flotation.
22 Jul 1987.Apparatus for froth flotation comprising a flotation tank having a series of cells separated by partitions but having a communicating common bottom sloped towards the feed end of.Coal is an extremely valuable natural resource in the United States because of its relative abundant supplies in this nation.Improving the quality of waste derived char by removing ashMSW and ASR char were subjected to sieving and pulverization sieving to screen incombustibles and the ash rich fraction as shown Figure 1.2.2 Coal cleaning methods for ash removal.Three kinds of coal cleaning methods were used to remove ash from char: float sink separation,froth flotation,and oil agglomeration.

## Froth flotation Wikipedia
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from Froth flotation to separate plastics,Phosphates and coal are also,COAL AND PYRITE SEPARATIONdecreased.Consequently,the separation efficiency was improved by increasing the salt concentration.The increase in coal recovery appeared to be due to compression of the electrical double layer surrounding each coal particle.Introduction.It was known for a long time that froth flotation of hydrophobic mate .&gt; rials such&nbsp;.

## Application of Froth Flotation Technique to Reduce Sulfur. ipcbee
Froth flotation is considered to be a very likable physico chemical method to eliminate pyritic sulfur from coal [5].It has been observed to a be an efficient particle separation process.The process works due to the difference in surface rophobicity of com ponents present in any mixture.Usually,the technique of froth flotation is&nbsp;.Effect of microemulsified collector on froth flotation of coalDemulsification of collectors significantly reduces their separation efficiency.A special emulsification device with a complex structure and high energy consumption has been reported to mix and prepare unstable emulsified collectors; however,its application in the coal froth flotation industry is impractical (Jones et al.1978).
