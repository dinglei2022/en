## The Effect of Bismuth in Lead Acid Batteries
1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;In the lead acid battery industry,the Bismuth effect is found in both grid alloys and lead oxide.The higher ratio of porosity in the positive active materials may be caused by chemical or physical transfer of bismuth compounds.Chemical transfer process: Bi2.Alloys of BismuthAlloys of bismuth are not used to a great extent in industry.The low melting point of the metal,and the fact that it forms simple eutectiferous series of alloys with certain other metals,enables it to be used,however,in the manufacture of &quot;fusible alloys.&quot; These are.
