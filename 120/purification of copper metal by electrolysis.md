## Purifiion of Copper ScienceAid
The purifiion of copper is a form of recycling,it is a way of obtaining new,pure copper from old pipes,wires,circuits,and so on.It uses electrolysis.How can electrolysis be used to purify copper? SocraticElectrolysis of copper transfers copper atoms from an impure copper anode to a pure copper hode,leaving the impurities behind.Unrefined copper is about 99 % pure.It contains traces of metals such as Fe,Zn,Ag,Au,and Pt.The purity can be increased to 99.95 % by electrolytic refining in a cell similar to that shown below.A thin sheet of highpurity Cu serves as the hode.
