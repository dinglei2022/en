## Reducing agents in the leaching of manganese ores: A
The leaching efficiency strongly depended on temperature and acid concentration.Manganese leaching efficiency of 94.1% was obtained after 180 min under the optimal experimental conditions of 1 M H 2 SO 4,liquid solid ratio of 8:1,mass ratio of sawdust to ore 0.25:1,and a stirring speed of 300 rpm at 90 &#176C.In contrast to other reports,theReductive Acid Leaching of Low Grade Manganese OresOur study emphasizes on the leaching of low grade manganese ores with minimal concentrations of both the organic acids.Acid produced by the biological species are of 0.5 M to 1M concentration and shows better lea ching capacity without any hazardous effect,therefore the acid concentration levels were taken as per the natu ral concentration.
