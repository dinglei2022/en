## Fish Feed Extrusion Process Extruded Aqua Feed with
What is Fish Feed Extrusion Process.Commercial fish feed extrusion process refers to cook the mixture of feed ingredients under high temperature,moisture and high pressure by means of fish feed extruder within short time,whereby the high temperature is a direct result of friction(dry extrusion) or preconditioning and steam injection (wet extrusion).Diffusion Leaching of Nutrients from Shrimp FeedsDiffusion Leaching of Nutrients from Shrimp Feeds.Dallas Weaver (deweaver@me): The complexity of shrimp feeds is much greater than most feed millers and nutritionists are willing to admit.Shrimp are slow feeders,and the feed can be in the water for hours before it is consumed.
