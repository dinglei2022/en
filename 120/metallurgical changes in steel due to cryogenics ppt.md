## Martensitic Transformation in Steels Metallurgy
3 M s Temperature: For each steel,the austenite to martensite transformation begins (after a considerable undercooling) at a definite temperature,called M s (where ‘S’ stands for the start of martensite transformation) temperatures,which is uniquely determined by the chemical composition M s temperature can vary over a wide temperature range from as high as 500&#176;C (≈ 539&#176;C.12 LABORATORY SAMPLE PREPARATION12213 Losses Due to Reactions Between Sample and Container Specific elements may be lost from sample materials from interaction with a container Such losses may be significant,especially for trace analyses used in radioanalytical work Adsorption reactions are discussed in Chapter 10 for glass and plastic containers Losses due to adsorption

## Cryogenic Treatment Technical Information Metal
May 19,2005&nbsp&#0183&#32In reference to my previous post on 'Cryogenic Treatment effect on Hardness' can someone point me to some good reference materials on cryogenicEffect of Heat Treatment Processes on the Mechanical,the steel increases with cooling rate and also with increasing pearlite percentage which increased as the percentage mertensite increas The reason being that martensite is one of the strengthening phases in steel The increase in the hardness was the delay in the formation due to of peatrlite and martensite at a higher cooling rate
