## Specific Gravity Of General Materials Table
The specific gravity of all other materials are compared to water as a fraction heavier or fraction lighter density,no matter how small or large the fraction is.For example,ammonium nitrate has a specific gravity (sg) of 0.73 while dry ammonium sulphate has a sg of 1.13 (1130 kilograms cubic meter).Void Ratio for Common Gravel &amp Sand SciencingIn soil mechanics,the void ratio describes the relationship between the volume of voids,or spaces,in the soil or aggregate to the volume of solid constituents,or grains.Algebraically,e = Vv Vs,where e represents the void ratio,Vv represents the volume of voids and Vs represent the volume of solid grains.
