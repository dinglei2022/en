## How Are Metals Extracted From Their Ores? Reference
How Are Metals Extracted From Their Ores? Refiners oxidize the liquid copper to remove iron and remaining sulfur components,resulting in 97 percent pure copper.Electroplating is the final step in producing 99.99 percent pure copper.Processing copper oxides requires a completely different process,involving leaching.CHEMISTRY: The extraction of Iron and its impact on theSep 04,2012&nbsp&#0183&#32Impacts on the environment due to the extraction of iron from haematite does not only start during the extraction of iron from the ore it starts when the raw materials are being mined and transported.The following are problems which arise from these processes: From mining and transporting of raw materials Air pollution Noise pollution
