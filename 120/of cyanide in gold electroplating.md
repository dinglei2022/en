## Some recent topics in gold plating for electronics applications
A review is presented of selected recent topics in electrolytic and electroless gold plating for electronics applications.The topics covered include developments of non cyanide electroplating baths for plating soft gold suitable for fabricating microbumps on siliconNon cyanide Sulfite gold plating2006 A.Hi Chris.Acid gold cyanide is not nearly as toxic as sodium cyanide itself,but there are also gold sulfite and other gold plating baths which are cyanide free.I am not aware of any gold plating bath that uses gold anodes,but this is probably not due to.
