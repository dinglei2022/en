## Vehicle Engine Sludge Consumer Reports
Engine failure due to sludge is a major problem for car owners,and automakers appear to have been slow to address it,generally linking it to poor maintenance rather than to a problem with theReducing Head Loss in Sludge Pumping Appliions WaterWorldThe treatment of sludge is one of the more demanding appliions in the sector.As a result,poor performing pumping systems can often result from underestimating this substance and not considering the special requirements.Roman Gabryjonczyk provides advice on designing a suitable piping system to pump sludge and reduce head loss.
