## Evaluation of the bearing capacity of poor subgrade soils,
23 02 2021&#0183;&#32;In this study,pavement subgrade soils were stabilized with two difference types of waste marble powder,and California bearing ratio (CBR) tests were conducted to evaluate the improvement in their bearing capacity To this end,highly plastic silt (MH) and highly plastic clay (CH) layers were used as the subgrade soil material A number of unsoaked CBR tests were conducted on the test samples.[PDF] Self compacting concrete using Marble Sludge Powder,Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) has had a remarkable impact on the concrete construction industry,especially the precast concrete industry Crushed Rock Dust (CRD) and Marble Sludge Powder (MSP) are discarded in the nearby land and the natural fertility of the soil is spoiled MSP and CRD can be used as filler and helps to reduce the total voids content in concrete
