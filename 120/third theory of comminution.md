The relationship between the comminution energy and the product size obtained for a,Kick (1885) proposed the theory that the equivalent relative reductions in sizes require equal energy,tively,and K2 is a constant Bond (1952) proposed the ‘Third Law’ of grinding The Third Law states that the net energy required in comminution is.Energysize reduction "laws" revisited ScienceDirectCriteria for choosing a descriptive measure of the "size" or fineness of comminuted particles are discussed.A new derivation of the energysize reduction relationship is presented by combining a similarity solution to the integrodifferential equation of grinding with an empirical correlation between breakage rate function and power draft to the mill.
