## Rutile and ilmenite in Australia Chemlink
Synthetic rutile can be produced from naturally occurring ilmenite which is a complex oxide with iron.Rutile is used in the manufacture of titanium dioxide pigment.In Australia most rutile is produced from ilmenite as it naturally occurs in accessible high concentrations and in a form which allows the ready extraction of the rutile.TiZir Titanium and Iron TiZir LimitedHighpurity pig iron a valuable coproduct.The highpurity pig iron produced as part of the smelting process (which is renowned for its low phosphorus and sulphur contents) is sold to a varied and large number of customers,and includes windmill,automotive and engine parts,as well as tools and heavy castings.How ilmenite is processed

## Carbothermal Reduction and Nitridation of Ilmenite
Iron oxides in ilmenite concentrates were reduced to metallic iron,and titanium oxides were converted to titanium oxycarbonitride.Reduction of ilmenite concentrates and synthetic rutile in hydrogen containing gas was significantly faster than in pure nitrogen.The rate of conversion of titania to titanium oxycarbonitride in the 50 vol% HPetrochemistry of the Reduced,IlmeniteSeries GranitoidDoing research,two suites of OligoceneMiocene granitoids,one relatively oxidized (magnetiteseries) and the other relatively reduced (ilmeniteseries),were identified at Hired,Eastern Iran.Since AuSn mineralization is associated only with the relatively reduced ilmeniteseries suite.

## Method of reduction of ilmenite concentrate
When the air excess factor more than 0.95,because of the developed active surface of the powder recovered cinder ilmenite concentrate is going on is it oxidation restored iron gaseous products water gas and carbon dioxide.The degree of reduction of iron from cinder ilmenite concentrate is reduced.The method is implemented as follows.Becher process The Full WikiThe iron oxide in the mineral grains is reduced to metallic iron to produce reduced ilmenite: Fe 2 O 3 &#183TiO 2 (s) + 3 CO (g) â†’ 2 Fe (s) + 2 TiO 2 (s) + 3 CO 2 (g) Once the Reduced Ilmenite has cooled it is separated from the char by screening,then continues to the next step of the process.

## Ilmenite Reduction Lunarpedia
Ilmenite is attractive for this purpose as the iron oxides it contains require less energy to reduce than any other oxide on the lunar surface.For this reason,proposals which have oxygen production as the primary goal usually focus on reduction of the iron content of ilmenite.Hydrogen ReductionMechanically activated carbothermic reduction of ilmeniteIt was found that after ball milling of an ilmenitecarbon mixture at room temperature,the ilmenite was reduced to rutile and metallic iron during subsequent lowtemperature annealing (760 &#176C for 30 minutes).A longer milling time results in a lower reduction temperature and a higher reduction rate.

## The production of synthetic rutile and byproduct iron
A study has been carried out on the Becher and Summit Processes with the aim of understanding the mechanism and critical parameters required for the production of a range of pure iron oxide pigments,as well as high quality synthetic rutile from reduced ilmenite.The Becher Process currently produces a large quantity of worthless mixed phase iron oxides.Studying the Pelletization of Rosseta Ilmenite Concentratephases in the ilmenite concentrate were ilmenite and pseudorutile.The reaction started with the reduction of pseudorutile to ilmenite and titania,followed by the reduction of ilmenite to metallic iron and titania.Titania was reduced to Ti3O5 and even more to
