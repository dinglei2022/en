## Crushed Limestone Concrete Aggregate Texas Crushed
First,for a given amount of cement in the mix,crushed limestone concrete will have an approximately 10% strength advantage.This strength advantage comes from the fact that cement bonds tighter to limestone than to a slick smooth gravel and the strength that is derived from the sharp angular faces of the crushed aggregate.Second,becauseUse of Limestone Fines to Reduce Permeability of ConcreteTraditionally,the use of limestone fines (LF) in concrete is to replace either part of the cement or part of the fine aggregate,notwithstanding this,the authors are advoing that the LF should be better used as cement paste replacement,which is expected to improve the durability and sustainability of concrete at the same time.To verify this new strategy of using LF,9 nos.concrete
