## Room and Pillar Mining RitchieWiki
Room and pillar is a method employed in underground mining in which rooms are cut into the coal bed and pillars of ore are left to provide support This method is usually employed when ore is positioned in flat and narrow deposits The room and pillar method also helps control the flow of air within the mineFirst Workings Bord & PillarFirst workings are conducted for two main reasons: To develop the pillars,bords and or panels to enable their subsequent extraction,and To develop multiple main entries for access to the coal reserv
