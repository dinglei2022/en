## Mining health and safety: 7 common risks to protect.
8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The mining industry has a reputation for being a risky business,with health risks that are varied and often quite serious,and it is important for miners to protect themselves accordingly.Nevertheless,mining doesn’t have to be unsafe.With the introduction of strict safety legislation and protocol,as well as advances in safety equipment,the industry has seen its fatality rate drop over.7 Safety Tips to Reduce Mining Accidents5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Never try to save on safety equipment.If an item no longer complies with the current safety standards,replace it,even if this means increasing expenses or delaying a project.Never allow staff to use outdated safety equipment,even for a short period of time.The number of safety related incidents in the mining industry is high.
