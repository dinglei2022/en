## Which Element Is the Best Conductor of Electricity?
Silver also has the highest thermal conductivity of any element and the highest light reflectance.Although it is the best conductor,copper and gold are used more often in electrical appliions because copper is less expensive and gold has a much higher corrosion resistance.Because silver tarnishes,it is less desirable for high frequenciesExtraction of gold from platinum group metal (PGM) oresThe ash is inductionmelted and deslaged and cast into anodes.These types of alloys are extremely variable in composition they are largely composed of copper and small amounts of gold,silver,palladium,platinum and sometimes ruthenium.The balance is composed of the less desirable metals like lead,tin,bismuth,iron and aluminum.
