## Gold extraction Wikipedia
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing,resulting in direct recovery ofRefining Systems Used to Make Gold Bars SciencingRefining gold using chemicals is another common method.Gold is treated with sulphuric,hydrochloric or nitric acids.The chemicals do not react with gold,but they react with impurities in the gold.
