If you can find a jeweler or plating shop who offers rose gold,your ring can certainly be plated with it,but it may be hard to find because it requires that they maintain a tank of rose gold plating solution (this is gold with a rather exacting amount of other metals like copper to give it the rose tint).Placer Gold Deposits of New Mexico USGSPLACER GOLD DEPOSITS OF NEW MEXICO By MAUREEN G.JOHNSON ABSTRACT Thirtythree placer districts in New Mexico are estimated to have produced a minimum of 661,000 ounces of placer gold from 1828 to 1968.The loion,areal extent,past production,mining history,and probable lode source of each district

## Maine Geological Survey: Gold in Maine
Gold in Maine.Gold occurs in several geologic environments in Maine: in bedrock,in sediments that were eroded from bedrock by glaciers,and in stream deposits derived from either of these sources.Veins of gold in bedrock are called &quotlode&quot deposits,and &quotplacer&quot deposits are concentrations of gold that accumulated in unconsolidated sediments.Gold Cube ConcentratorWith controlled water flow,the slick plate does 2 things: 1.It turns aggregate material into a slurry,and 2.The water flow forces the lighter particles ahead of the heavier material.It is quite exciting to actually see your fine gold creeping down the slick plate! Gold,the heaviest element in the slurry,will be the last to reach the trough.
