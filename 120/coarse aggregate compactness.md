## Soil compaction (agriculture) Wikipedia
Soil compaction,also known as soil structure degradation,is the increase of bulk density or decrease in porosity of soil due to externally or internally applied loads.Compaction can adversely affect nearly all physical,chemical and biological properties and functions of soil.Together with soil erosion,it is regarded as the &quotcostliest and most serious environmental problem caused byCN101570421A Selfcompacting concrete for prestressedThe invention discloses a selfcompacting concrete for prestressed girders with ultralong span.The selfcompacting concrete comprises the following parts of components by weight: 180210KG of water 350400KG of Portland cement 3035KG of a concrete admixture 700800KG of fine aggregates which are of medium coarse sand 9001000KG of coarse aggregates which are of crushed stone with
