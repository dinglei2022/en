Dec 13,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32Concrete strength is typically taken as the compressive strength of a group of standard cubes at 28 days that are representative of one concrete mix of which not more than 5 per cent of test results are expected to fall.This also referred to as characteristic strength or f ck and gives us the compressive strength classes in EN 206.An example of such a strength class is C40 50,where 40concrete mix design for c15 c20 c25 c30 c40 c45concrete mix design for c15 c20 c25 c30 c40 c45 Conventional grade C20,C25 and C30 concrete mix ratio.Jan 17,2018&#183 The strength of concrete is divided into twelve grades,such as C7.5,C10,C15,C20,C25,C30,C35,C40,C45,C50,C55,C60 and so on.
