## Patent US5114687 Ammonia extraction of gold
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the extraction of gold and silver from as solvent extraction ion exchange,Mining & Smelter Products PT Lautan Luas TbkIon Exchange Resin Recovery In recent years,resin has begun to replace carbon as the gold recovery substrate of choice,for both resin in leach and resin in Pulp The process used in resin recovery is similar to that of carbon,but the gold is adsorbed onto solid spherical polystyrene resin beads rather than activated carbon grains
