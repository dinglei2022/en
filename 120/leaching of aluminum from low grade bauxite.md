## Removal of Potassium and Iron in Low Grade Bauxite by a,
Abstract: In order to explore the commercialized applications of the low grade bauxite in the refractory industry,a calcination integrated with acid leaching method was adopted to remove the potassium (K) and iron (Fe) from the diaspore illite (DI) type low grade bauxite FollowingRecovery of Lanthanides from Indonesian Low Grade BauxiteThe present work describes the extraction of lanthanide (rare earth elements,REE) from low grade bauxite using acid leaching method.The aim of this study is to obtain the best condition for extraction of lanthanides from low grade bauxite.The effect of different parameters such as temperatures and concentration of oxalic acid in leaching process were investigated.
