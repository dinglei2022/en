## The Minamata Convention on Mercury and Artisanal,
The Minamata Convention on Mercury is increasing global interest in mercury pollution reduction activities,particularly in the area of Artisanal and Small Scale Gold Mining (ASGM) For most developing countries,Gold extraction WikipediaGold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing,resulting in direct recovery of

## The Mercury Problem in Artisanal and Small‐Scale Gold
Mercury‐dependent artisanal and small‐scale gold mining (ASGM) is the largest source of mercury pollution on Earth.In this practice,elemental mercury is used to extract gold from ore as an amalgam.The amalgam is typically isolated by hand and then heated—often with a torch or over a stove—to distill the mercury and isolate the gold.gold amalgamation mining indonesia videos ,gold amalgamation mining indonesia videos Gold Ore Crusher,Artisanal Gold Mining in Mali,West Africa (Long Version) ,Artisanal gold mining on Niger River in Mali,West Africa,February 2005 You can check out my book about traditional fishing and hunting in Mali here:.

## Origin and consumption of mercury in small scale gold mining
Virtually all progressive mining companies have banned the amalgamation process and use gravity separation to extract gold coarser than 100 mesh (0150 mm) and cyanidation for finer size fractions Coarse gold is extracted from a closed grinding circuit by a sequence of gravity separation processes (eg centrifuges followed by shaking,
