Size reduction in attrition mills occurs through the scraping of one surface against another Particles scrape against each other or against a rigid face In general,the size of the resulting particles can get near the micrometer level,but in the pharmaceutical industry,demand has increased for particles on the nanometer levelAdvances in Biomass Integrated Size Reduction and,•Use shear failure for grinding,and particle property difference for separation •Separation good for 10% or greater “threshold of difference” in property •Adjust potential to improve size reduction separation performance based on instrumented results

Size Reduction Size reduction is the process of reducing the particle size of a substance to a finer state of subdivision to smaller pieces to coarse particles or to powder Size reduction process is also referred to as comminution and grinding When the particle size of solids is reduced by mechanical means it is known as millingBiomass screening and size reduction ANDRITZClean biomass fuel of a consistent size Cost effective production of energy biomass is very much dependent on efficient handling of available biomass sources,as well as the efficiency of each process To release the full energy potential of biomass as fuel,the material must be cleaned of impurities and of the proper size for optimum utilization

## Trommel screen Wikipedia
A trommel screen,also known as a rotary screen,is a mechanical screening machine used to separate materials,mainly in the mineral and solid waste processing industri It consists of a perforated cylindrical drum that is normally elevated at an angle at the feed end Physical size separation is achieved as the feed material spirals down the rotating drum,where the undersized material.SIZE REDUCTION AND SIZE SEPERATION authorSTREAMFeb 13,2014&#0183;&#32;Size reduction: Size reduction is the process of reducing the particle size of a substance to a finer state Size reduction process is also referred to as comminution and grinding When the particle size of solids is reduced by mechanical means it is known as milling
