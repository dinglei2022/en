The sedimentary phosphate ore was derived from Yichang,Hubei province,in China,and its main chemical and mineral compositions are presented in Table 1 and Table 2,respectively.Table 1 showed that the raw ore was a typical calcareous and siliceous phosphate ore characterized by a middle grade of 23.34% P 2 O 5,with a relatively high content of SiO 2 (22.15%) and MgO (2.50%).Dissolution kinetics of phosphate ore in SO[sub 2In this work,the suitability of phosphate ore treated with the varied salts such as FeSO{sub 4},NaCl,CaCl{sub 2},Na{sub 2}SiO{sub 3},and Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4} as an alternative material for limestone and dolomite in flue gas desulfurization has been investigated.

In the present study,the feasibility to use phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) to develop a biological leaching process of rare earth elements (REE) from monazite bearing ore was determined.To predict the REE leaching capacity of bacteria,the phosphate solubilizing abilities of 10 species of PSB were determined by halo zone formation on Reyes minimal agar media supplemented with bromo.Use of phosphate rocks for sustainable agricultureExtensive research on the agronomic potential and actual effectiveness of phosphate rocks (PRs) as sources of phosphorus has been carried out in Africa,Asia,Latin America and elsewhere.A wealth of information is available,but it is scattered among meeting.
