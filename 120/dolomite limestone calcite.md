I have been finding a great deal of this material as thick veins in what I think is Limestone.I had always assumed Calcite,but it&#39;s seeming more&nbsp;.University of Minnesota’s Mineral Pages: DolomitePure samples of dolomite and calcite may have a similar appearance and share many properties,so the easiest way to distinguish them is by their reaction with room temperature dilute acid.Calcite (and aragonite) will readily react with acid to form small bubbles (effervescence).Dolomite will only effervesce if the mineral is ground up into.

Where calcite limestone is uncommon or too costly.dolomite and dolomitic limestone are added to soils and soilless potting mixes to lower their acidity.Calcite or dolomite: Lime type no factor in cotton study.Some crop managers have long believed that cotton fiber quality and lint yield are adversely affected by the higher magnesium content of dolomite lime (calcium magnesium carbonate) compared to that of calcite lime (calcium carbonate).Stevens noted that dolomite is sometimes more readily available than calcite.
