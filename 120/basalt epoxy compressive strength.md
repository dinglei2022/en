## Basalt fiber Wikipedia
Basalt fiber is a material made from extremely fine fibers of basalt,which is composed of the minerals plagioclase,pyroxene,and olivine.It is similar to fiberglass,having better physicomechanical properties than fiberglass,but being significantly cheaper than carbon fiber.It is used as a fireproof textile in the aerospace and automotive industries and can also be used as a composite toJournal of Reinforced Plastics On the mechanicalvalues in tensile strength,flexural strength,and compressive strength were attained at 0.4wt% multiwalled carbon nanotubes with 12%,38%,41% increase,respectively,compared to the basalt fiber epoxy composite.Potential mechanisms behind these were implied.Furthermore,compressive modulus and strength of the specimens were obtained

Failure mechanism analysis showed that the carboxylic CNTs was beneficial for forming good interfacial bonding between epoxy matrix and basalt fibers,and the advantage of high axial tensile strength of basalt fibers could be fully utilized,which is responsible for the enhanced ultimate compressive strength of carboxylic CNTs filled basaltMicrostructure and mechanical properties of basalt fibretrends observed for compressive strength.The incorporation of the fibres resulted in an increase in flexural strength for all mixtures except BMB 436,which contained 0.31% fibre (i.e.6 kg m3).Mixtures reinforced with 2% BMB was found to yield the highest flexural strength of 9.2 MPa,which is more than twice as that of the control.

## Basalt Fiber Properties,Advantages and Disadvantages
Basalt fiber is a relative newcomer to fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) and structural composites.It has a similar chemical composition as glass fiber but has better strength characteristics,and unlike most glass fibers is highly resistant to alkaline,acidic and salt attack making it a good candidate for concrete,bridge and shoreline structures.
