Pig Iron is a very low grade of Iron,often mixed with scrap metals in the smelting process,that is much less sturdy that normal steel.Making it useless for most tasks one would use Steel forprocess for refining iron ore bondhumahal.inThe Ore Extraction and Refining Process Before iron ore can be used in a blast furnace,it must be extracted from the ground and partially refined to remove most of the impurities.Leaning on his long tongs,this young iron puddler's helper posed for this photograph in the early 1860s,when the Sons of Vulcan was a young union.
