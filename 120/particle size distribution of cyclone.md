## Collection efficiencies and particle size distributions,
The grade collection efficiencies and particle size distributions from Stairmand type cyclones are compared with predictions from four theories,viz the models of Leith and Licht (1972),Dietz (1981) Mothes and Loffler (1988) and Li and Wang (1989)Dense Medium Cyclone 911metallurgistMagnetite size distribution.Cyclone inlet feed pressure.In most cases,the appropriate mediumtocoal ratio is determined by the coal preparation plant builder during the conceptual design phase of the project.Most dense medium cyclone circuits in the United States are operated with mediumtocoal ratios of 3:1 to 4:1,by volume.
