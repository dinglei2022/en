## Back to Basics: 4 Types of Adsorption Dryers
Mar 01,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Adsorption drying is a chemical process in which water vapor is bound to adsorption material that can either be a solid or liquid.The general working principle of adsorption dryers is simple: moist air flows over hygroscopic material — typically silica gel,molecular sieves or activated alumina — and is then dried.Air dryer condenser and adsorption Air In Motion1.Adsoprtion dryer.An adsorption dryer is used if a conventional air dryer cannot be used.This is the case when air drying is desired at a low temperature or at low humidity.Regardless of the air temperature,moisture from the ambient air absorbed by the adsorbent (silica gel),which is present in the rotor of the adsorption air dryer.
