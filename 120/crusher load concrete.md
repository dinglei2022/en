## Rankin's Formula Example for Column Crushing Buckling Load.
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;If column is short,calculated load will be known as crushing load.And load will be buckling or crippling load,in case of long column.This formula only gives the ultimate load,but columns are design on safe load.In order to get safe load,divide ultimate load ( Load obtained from Rankin’s Formula) with factor of safety (F.O.S).A Simple Guide to Concrete Cube TestingBefore the concrete is scooped into the moulds,the moulds must be lightly coated in a mould release agent.This ensures that the concrete does not stick to the mould and makes it easier to remove the cube.When using a 150mm mould,the concrete sample is scooped into the mould in 3 equal layers (50mm) and compacted between each layer.
