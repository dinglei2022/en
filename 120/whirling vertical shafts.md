## calculating shaft critical speed by hand Mechanical,
Jan 16,2006&#0183;&#32;To make things more difficult: are there disk or rotors on the shaft,so a whirling effect may be expected? RE: calculating shaft critical speed by hand,Of the pedestal modes,vertical is axial compression of the structure,which is inherently stiff,whereas horizonatl is bending of the structure (typically) which is likely to be less stiffFind the critical speed whirling amplitude at the critical.Find the critical speed,whirling amplitude at the critical.A vertical shaft 20mm diameter rotates in LONG BEARINGS and disc of mass 15kg is attached to the mid.
