## How Cyanide Leaching is Used in Gold Mining.
Most open pit gold mining operations around the world use a heap leaching to extract ores from these types of deposits.Consider that most of the largest gold mines in the world are mining what would be considered low grade ore by most standards.It would be impossible to profitably work most of these ores without use of cyanide.Patent US4256706 Leaching agglomerated …Percolation leaching of gold or silver ores,tailings or wastes is accomplished by a process comprising initial agglomeration of fines in the feed by means of a.

## Heap Leaching Gold & Silver Ores
Exploration during the past few years has identified numerous low grade,gold silver deposits throughout the Western United States.Recent increases in gold and silver prices have generated a great deal of interest in processing these low grade ores by heap leaching.Processing technologies for gold telluride ores SpringerLinkGold telluride ores are important gold refractory ores due to the presence of sulfides and other gangue materials.The classification and main physical properties of gold telluride ores were described,and possible treatment methods including flotation,leaching,and oxidation were reviewed.
