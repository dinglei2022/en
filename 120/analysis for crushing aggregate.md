## 7 Lab Test on Aggregates that we Use in Concrete Construction!
The crushing test on aggregate gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate crushing under gradually applied compressive load.If the aggregate crushing value is less than 10,it signifies an exceptionally strong aggregate.Whereas,if the crushing value is 35 or above,it would normally be considered as weak aggregates.Aggregates for ConcreteAggregates may be broadly classi fied as natural or artificial,both with respect to source and to method of preparation.Natural sands and gravels are the product of weathering and the action of wind or water,while manufactured crushed fine aggregate and crushed stone coarse and fine aggregate are produced by crushing natural stone.
