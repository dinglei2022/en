## Scenarios for concrete rubble recycling in the Netherlands,
The integrated LCC LCA study indicates that recycling concrete rubble into coarse aggregate for concrete with ADR technology provided environmental benefits at a higher cost for the Steiger 113 project,compared to the virtual option of processing the stony fraction through regular crushing and sourcing imported gravel for the new constructionUse of Recycled Concrete Aggregate in PCCP: Literature SearchProperties and Characteristics of Recycled Concrete Aggregate A concrete pavement’s strength and performance is very dependent on the aggregates used to produce the concrete Recycled concrete aggregates are different in many ways from virgin aggregates as shown in Table 1 Table 1 Comparison of typical virgin aggregate and recycled concrete.
