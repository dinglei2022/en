## NONMETALLIC INCLUSIONS IN THE SECONDARY ALUMINUM,
production of 2xxx ,5xxx and 7xxx series rolling ingots These,AA 7075 is an alloy with an average magnesium content of 25 % Due to the relatively high affinity of both magnesium and aluminum to oxygen,oxides are going to be produced at everyAluminium production processPrimary aluminium is cast into ingots and shipped to customers or used in the production of aluminium alloys for various purpos,copper or magnesium These alloys are used in the manufacture of automobile and aviation engines and aluminium alloy wheels.
