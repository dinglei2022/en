## Reactor processdesign
The fluidized bed reactor is a reactor in which the fluid from the bottom of the reactor keeps the solid catalysts suspended inside the reactor This reactor has an advantage over traditional packed bed reactor because it has a better heat and mass transferLarge Scale Pyrolysis Oil Technical ReportLarge Scale Pyrolysis Oil Technical Report Production: A Technology NREL TP 510 37779,Process Schematic for a Circulating Fluidized Bed Pyrolysis Design,10 Figure 3 Schematic of the NREL Vortex Reactor Fast Pyrolysis Reactor Design,11 Figure 4 Molecular Beam Mass Spectrometer Scans of Pyrolysis Product Profile at,
