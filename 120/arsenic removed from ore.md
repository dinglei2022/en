## Arsenic Wikipedia
Arsenic is a chemical element with symbol As and atomic number 33.Arsenic occurs in many minerals,usually in combination with sulfur and metals,but also as a pure elemental crystal.Arsenic is a metalloid.It has various allotropes,but only the gray form,which has a metallic appearance,is important to industry.The primary use of arsenic is in alloys of lead (for example,in car batteries.Mechanism research on arsenic removal from arsenopyrite.The mechanism of arsenic removal during a sintering process was investigated through experiments with a sintering pot and arsenic bearing iron ore containing arsenopyrite; the corresponding chemical properties of the sinter were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP AES),X ray diffraction (XRD),and.
