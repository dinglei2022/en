## ILMENITE (Iron Titanium Oxide)
Ilmenite is an economically important and interesting mineral.It is named for its place of discovery (such places are called type localities) at Ilmen Lake in the Ilmen Mountains,Miask in the southern portion of the Ural Mountains of Russia.Ilmenite forms as a primary mineral in mafic igneous rocks and is concentrated into layers by a process called"magmatic segregation".Titanium Ore Market Global Trends and Forecast by,Titanium Ore can be defined as any mineral containing titanium in compounds and concentrations and it occurs mainly in igneous rock Rutile and ilmenite are the two major sources of titanium ore among which ilmenite is the most preferred source for producing titanium metal after removing iron form.
