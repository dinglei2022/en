## Cement Industry Overview
The cement industry has boosted efficiency by concentrating new capital investment in plants that use the dry process of cement manufacture,and by phasing out operations that rely on the more energyintensive wet process.Since 1974,the number of wet process kilns has dropped from 234 to 25 a decline of 89 percent while the number ofDry process WikipediaIn process engineering Dry process may refer to:.Dry process (cement) used in cement manufacture using Cement kilns Dry spinning process in fibre spinning Dry process in Coffee production Dry process in Coconut oil production Dry process in the manufacture of Separators for electrochemical cells

Removal of this excess water necessitates the use of a longer kiln for the wet process.The total power consumption in this process is also higher and the output lower than in the dry process.However,blending is much easier in a wet state.Most modern plants opt for the dry processDry Mix Process and Wet Mix Process for ShotcreteDry mix process and wet mix process are the two methods of shotcrete construction which are based on the time at which the water is added to the mortar or Shotcrete is a type of concrete or mortar mix that is shot onto a surface at highspeed.The shotcrete process can be performed in two ways,either using a dry mix or by means of a wet mix.
