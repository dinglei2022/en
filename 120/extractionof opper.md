## Separation of Copper and Nickel by Solvent Extraction
Separation of copper and nickel by liquidliquid extraction from aqueous solutions was studied using LIX 664N in kerosene as solvent.Both metals were taken in their sulfate form and ratio of copper to nickel in feed solutions was maintained as 10:1.LIX 664N concentration in kerosene was varied from 10% to 40% (v v) and its effect was studied on percent extraction of copper and nickel forExtracting copper.Extracting copper.SchoolScience.co.ukExtracting copper : Metals are found as ores buried in the Earth's crust.So how do we get to the final metal? There are three main stages.mining extraction purifiion.Let's look at each of these in more detail.Picture 4.A copper mine.The size of the trucks in the picture give an idea of the scale.
