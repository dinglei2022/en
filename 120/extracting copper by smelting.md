## Gold cyanidation Wikipedia
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthurForrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from lowgrade ore byGCSE CHEMISTRY Extraction of Copper Thermal2017327&ensp&#0183&enspExtraction of Metals.Extraction of Copper.Copper is sometimes found as native metal.Copper ores include copper(II) oxide and copper(II) sulfide.Copper(II) oxide can be reduced by reaction with carbon.Some copper ores may contain only small amounts of copper.These are called low grade ores and have less than 1% copper but they are still used because copper is so valuable.
