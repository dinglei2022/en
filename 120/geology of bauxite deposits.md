Abstract This paper presents procedures and technical parameters used for resource estimation of bauxite deposits including the non consolidated pisolitic bauxite (Weipa) and the intensely lithified types (Gove,Sangaredi,Az Zabira) Bauxite resources are usually estimated by drilling and sampling drill holes at 025 to 05 m intervalsAluminum Deposits of North Queensland Geology forThe aluminum deposits near Weipa in the York Peninsula of northern Queensland,Australia are among the largest and highest grade lateritic bauxite deposits in the

## ORE DEPOSIT TYPES AND THEIR PRIMARY EXPRESSIONS KG,
Ore deposits are crustal concentrations of useful elements that can be exploited at a proﬁt Like all crustal rocks,they consist of minerals formed by geological process There are four basic geological requirements for any ore deposit to form (Figure 1): i) a source for the ore components (metals and ligands);Bauxite Geoscience AustraliaThe large bauxite resources in the Gulf of Carpentaria at Weipa (&gt;3000 Mt) in Queensland and Gove (&gt;200 Mt) in the Northern Territory have average grades between 49% and 53% Al 2 O 3 and are amongst the world's highest grade deposits
