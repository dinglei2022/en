## HighStrength Concrete cement
A common practice is to use a superplasticizer in combination with a waterreducing retarder.The superplasticizer gives the concrete adequate workability at low watercement ratios,leading to concrete with greater strength.The waterreducing retarder slows the hydration of the cement and allows workers more time to place the concrete.Chapter 3 Fly Ash in Portland Cement Concrete Fly AshAdditional cement replacement would affect early strength development.Characteristics of cement vary,as do fly ashes,and not all combinations produce a good concrete.The selected portland cement should be tested and approved on its own merit,as well as evaluated in combination
