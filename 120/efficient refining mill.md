## 2006 Forum on Energy: Immediate Solutions,Emerging.
High Consistency Refining (HCR) uses less than 10% of the power applied to separate and develop fibers for papermaking; approximately 90% of the energy is lost in the form of “low quality” steam.High Efficiency refining is required to reduce the heat loss and better use power to develop wood fibers.Fine Refining Ball MillThe ball mill is easy to maintain as all wear parts are manufactured from high grade materials and are easily accessible for replacement.The design of the vessel,shaft pin configuration,and ideal parameter control,make this ball mill the most efficient in today’s market.
