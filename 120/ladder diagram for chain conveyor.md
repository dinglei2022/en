## LADDER LOGIC Sharif
In ladder diagrams,the load device (lamp,relay coil,solenoid coil,etc) is almost always drawn at the right hand side of the rung While it doesn't matter electrically where the relay coil is located within the rung,it does matter which end of the ladder's power supply is grounded,for reliable operation Take for instance this circuit:Conveyor Belt Multisim Help National InstrumentsObserve the interaction between the ladder diagram and the circuit as the simulation proceeds As the simulation proceeds,the box moves along the conveyor belt to Position Sensor 2 (PS2) The box stops moving and balls begin dropping from the hopper into the box
