## purifiion of copper by electrolysis metal extraction
The metal compounds can be processed to obtain the metal e.g.copper can be obtained from solutions of copper compounds by displacement using scrap iron orPhytomining and Bioleaching GCSE Triple Award RevisionMetal ores are a finite resource which are in limited supply.New methods of copper extraction exploit waste ores and low grade ores.Phytomining involves growing plants on top of low grade ores.The plants absorb copper ions through their roots The plants are then burnt to ashes containing copper ions.These ions are leached from the ash using sulfuric acid.
