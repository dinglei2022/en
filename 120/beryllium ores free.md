## BERYLLIUM AND BERYLLIUM COMPOUNDS Arsenic,Metals
Beryllium and beryllium compounds were considered by previous IARC Working Groups in 1971,1979,1987,and 1993 (IARC,1972,1980,1987,1993).Since that time,new data have become available,these have been incorporated in the Monograph,and taken into consideration in the present evaluation.Beryl: The Gem Mineral of Emerald,Aquamarine,MorganiteBeryl has served as a minor ore of beryllium,and color varieties of the mineral are among the world's most popular gemstones.Emerald,aquamarine,heliodor,and morganite are the most wellknown varieties of beryl.Beryllium Mirror: Most beryllium is used to make specialty alloys.It gives the alloys lightness and strength.

## Beryllium Element information,properties and uses
Beryllium is a silverywhite,lustrous,relatively soft metal of group 2 of the periodic table.The metal is unaffected by air or water,even at red heat.When copper and nickel are alloyed with beryllium they not only become much better at conducting electricity and heat,but they display remarkable elasticity.beryllium ore search buyenvironmentalBeryllium oxide is an excellent heat conductor,with high strength and hardness,and acts as an electrical insulator in some appliions.The United States,one of only three countries that process beryllium ores and concentrates into beryllium products,supplies most of the rest of the world with these products.
