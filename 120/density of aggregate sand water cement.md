## Effect of water absorption by the aggregate on properties
amount of water moved out from the aggregate already when the cement paste was in a fresh state.When dry,water absorbing lightweight aggregate was used,the water absorption by the aggregate significantly increased the loss of concrete workability.When prewetted aggregateWhat is the bulk density of aggregate? AnswersDriveBulk density of aggregates is the mass of aggregates required to fill the container of a unit volume after aggregates are batched based on volume.It depends on the packing of aggregate i.e.Either loosely packed aggregates or well dense compacted aggregates.
