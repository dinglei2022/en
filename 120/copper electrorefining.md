## Recovering Scrap Anode Copper Using Reactive Electrodialysis
Copper electro refining is the electrochemical dissolution of an anode of the same material of the smelting process,which contains 99.5% copper weight,and then is deposited onto a stainless steel sheet with 99.99% pure copper [1] [2].The fundamental process is illustrated in Figure 1.Investigations on Anode Quality in Copper Electrorefining.Abstract.Copper anodes have to have a certain quality in order to meet the requirements of subsequent electrorefining.The anode casting process is decisive for anode quality,which determines anodic dissolution behaviour during electrorefining.
