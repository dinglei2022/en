## The Theory Amrita Online Lab
For example,on mixing a solution of barium chloride with sodium sulphate,a white precipitate of barium sulphate is immediately formed.These reactions are ionic in nature.The reactants changes into ions when dissolved in water and there is an exchange of ions in solution.This results in the formation of product molecule.Assessment of drug content uniformity of atropine sulfateAtropine sulfate is an anticholinergic agent for treatment of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and is orally administrated as a triturate with lactose hydrate.Because of the low safety margin of atropine sulfate,triturate uniformity is a key safety factor.In this study,we assessed the uniformity of atropine sulfate in 1000fold triturates prepared by wet mixing and dry mixing methods and
