## Separation and characterization of magnetic
Separation and characterization of magnetic fractions from wastetoenergy bottom ash with an emphasis on the leachability of heavy metalsMagnetic SeparationCarrier magnetic separation has been proposed for more effective separation of water and solids from acid mine water to generate very pure water (Feng et al.2000).As discussed in Chapter 10,dissolved heavy metals like zinc and copper can be recovered from acid mine drainage (AMD) by selective precipitation controlling the pH for the precipitation of specific metals.
