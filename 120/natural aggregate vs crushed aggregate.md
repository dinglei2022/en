## Aggregates from Natural and Recycled Sources
AGGREGATES FROM NATURAL AND RECYCLED SOURCES Economic Assessments for Construction Appliions—A Materials Flow Study By David R.Wilburn and Thomas G.Goonan ABSTRACT Increased amounts of recycled materials are being used to supplement natural aggregates (derived from crushed stone,sand and gravel) in road construction.An understandThe Effect of Aggregate Properties on ConcreteThe Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete Concrete is a mixture of cementious material,aggregate,and water.Aggregate is commonly considered inert filler,which accounts for 60 to 80 percent of the volume and 70 to 85 percent of the weight of concrete.

Apr 18,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Crushed aggregate,also known as rock aggregate,refers to a crushed stone product produced in quarries.In areas where natural sand and gravel aggregate deposits are insufficient to handle local demand,larger stones are processed in an impact crusher to create crushed rock aggregate.The greater costs of production involved in mining and processing the stones to create crushed aggregate
