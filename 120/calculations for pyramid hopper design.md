## Valley Angle Of Hopper Industrial Professionals
Oct 22,2008&nbsp&#0183&#32Valley Angle Of Hopper posted in Industrial Professionals: Can anybody help me out to understand what is meant by&quotvalley angle&quot of a pyramidal hopper (placed below an ESP).I find it is given that the valley angle should be more than 55 deg with horizontal.Which angle is actually meant by &quotvalley angle&quotfor a hopper?Is there any relationship between valley angle of hopper and angle of reposeTen Steps to an Effective Bin Design AIChEBefore choosing a bin and hopper for your bulk solids appliion,the flow properties and characteristics of the powder or bulk material must be known.Use this tenstep approach to determine the optimal bin design for your process.Eric Maynard Jenike &amp Johanson,Inc.Ten Steps to an Effective Bin Design Solids In Conveyor Silo or Bin Hopper
