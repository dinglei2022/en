Boron and tungsten are found in common minerals,boron in Kernite and tungsten in FerberiteHeubnerite,but no uranium mineral is common,and most are very rare.The availability of an element depends not only on its abundance,but on its concentration by geological processes into an economic ore.Uranium Water SolutionsMany different engineered IX systems are used in uranium mining.The system used depends on local conditions and ore characteristics.Dow Water &amp Process solutions offers IX resins tailored to the type of leach and engineered system used.Please see the special page in the Markets section for product recommendations,depending on your appliion:

## Uranium Wikipedia
Uranium ore is mined in several ways: by open pit,underground,insitu leaching,and borehole mining (see uranium mining).Lowgrade uranium ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25% uranium oxides.Extensive measures must be employed to extract the metal from its ore.Which does not belong uranium salt boron or hydogen?Uranium,boron and hydrogen are chemical elements.A salt is a chemical compound (contain two or more elements).
