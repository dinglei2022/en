## Modifiion of PLGA Nanoparticles for Improved Properties
Abstract We have earlier reported on the possible appliion of poly [lactide (coglycolide)] (PLGA) nanoparticles of suitable size to serve as a 99mTclabeled diagnostic tracer in sentinel lymph node detection (SLND).Additional efforts have now been made to improve both the radiolabeling yield and the biological efficacy by modifying the PLGA particles.Protocols Springer LabThe listed protocols were prepared to the best knowledge of the contributors.Springer Lab is not responsible for any unsatisfactory results.If you find a protocol helpful,please refer to this web site in your publiions,and we will be glad to hear from you.

## PHYLLOPLANINS: NOVEL ANTIFUNGAL PROTEINS ON
PHYLLOPLANINS: NOVEL ANTIFUNGAL PROTEINS ON PLANT AERIAL LEAF SURFACES Secreted surface proteins are an innate immune defense component employed by animals to inhibit invading microbes.Surface proteins have not been documented in plants,even though the aerial leaf surface,or phylloplane,is a major site of pathogen ingress.We have discoveredHeatinducedradiolabeling and click chemistry: A powerfultic agents (multifunctionality),while being targeted to cell surface receptors.Here a facile combination of techniques for the syntheses of multimodal,targeted nanoparticles (NPs) is presented,whereby heatinducedradiolabeling (HIR) labels NPs with radiometals and socalled click chemistry is used to attach bioactive groups to the NP surface.
