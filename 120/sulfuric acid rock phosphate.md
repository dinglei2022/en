## Sulfuric acid Wikipedia
Sulfuric acid (alternative spelling sulphuric acid),also known as vitriol,is a mineral acid composed of the elements sulfur,oxygen and hydrogen,with molecular formula H 2 SO 4It is a colorless,odorless,and syrupy liquid that is soluble in water,in a reaction that is highly exothermicpurity of 73 bpl rock phosphate mulberrycottagecozaPhosphoric acid is produced on a massive scale for fertilizer by treating phosphate rock with sulfuric ac In contrast,preparation of more elaborate phosphorus compounds used in chemical alysis,pharmaceutical,and battery appliions requires laborious generation and chlorination of elemental phosphorus
