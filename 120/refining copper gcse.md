The blister copper is already virtually pure (in excess of 99% copper).But for today's market,this is not really pure enough! It is purified further using electrolysis.This is known as electrolytic refining.The blister copper is cast into large slabs which will be used as the anodes in the electrolysis apparatus (see page 4).The electrolytic refining of copper produces the high qualityGCSE OCR Gateway Chemistry C61b Refining copper,GCSE OCR Gateway Chemistry C61b Refining copper by electrolysis C61b To be able to explain why and how electrolysis is used to extract some metals from their ores Electrolysis of aqueous copper sulfate solution
