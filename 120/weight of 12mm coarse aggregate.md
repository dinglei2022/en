## Specific Gravity of Coarse Aggregates: Its Importance,
As per the definition given in the ‘IS: 2386 (Part III) 1963’,(Indian Standard Methods of Test for Aggregates for Concrete Specific Gravity,Density,Voids,Absorption and Bulking),the specific gravity of coarse aggregates is the weight of the aggregates dried to constant weight in an oven at 100&#176;C divided by its absolute volume including the natural voids within the aggregate.Classifiion of Aggregates Based on Size and Shape2016722&ensp&#0183&enspAggregates can be classified in many ways.Classifiion of aggregates based on shape and size such as coarse and fine aggregates are discussed here,Aggregates are the important constituents of the concrete which give body to the concrete and also reduce shrinkage.Aggregates occupy 70 to 80 % of
