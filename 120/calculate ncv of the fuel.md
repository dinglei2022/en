YahooSep 06,2006&nbsp&#0183&#32Best Answer: To calculate these parameters for a particular sample of natural gas,you'd need to know the composition of the gas in terms of its gaseous constituents (e.g.methane,ethane,butane,propane,as well as noncombustable gasses like nitrogen,oxygen,carbon dioxide,etc.).Natural gas is mostly methane,but also contains variable amounts of these other species.

YahooMay 04,2008&nbsp&#0183&#32Best Answer: GCV (gross calorific value) is the quantity of heat produced by combustion when the water produced by combustion is allowed to return to the liquid state.NCV (net calorific value) is the quantity of heat produced by combustion when the water produced by combustion remains gaseous.Since water releases heat when it condenses,GCV is clearly bigger than NCV.
