## Closed loop System and Closed loop Control Systems
A Closed loop Control System,also known as a feedback control system is a control system which uses the concept of an open loop system as its forward path but has one or more feedback loops (hence its name) or paths between its output and its input The reference to “feedback”,simply means that some portion of the output is returned.Closed loop control KSBClosed loop control (general) Closed loop control is a procedure during which a quantity to be controlled (controlled quantity) is continually measured,compared to another quantity (reference quantity),and adjusted accordingly in a closed loop Closed loop control is therefore a process whereby the output variable also influences the control.
