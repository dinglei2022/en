Abiogenic petroleum origin is a body of hypotheses which propose that petroleum and natural gas deposits are mostly formed by inorganic means,rather than by the decomposition of organisms.Thomas Gold's deep gas hypothesis states that the origin of some natural gas deposits were formed out of hydrocarbons deep in the earth's mantle.Theories explaining the origin of petroleum as abioticBiogenic Silica in the Devonian Shale Succession of theBiogenic Silica in the Devonian Shale Succession of the Appalachian Basin,USA* Randy Blood1,Gary Lash2,and Lindell Bridges1 Search and Discovery Article #50864 (2013)** Posted September 23,2013 *Adapted from oral presentation given at AAPG 2013 Annual Convention and Exhibition,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,May 1922,2013
