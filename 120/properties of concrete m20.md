## Concrete Block Specifiion Properties of Concrete block
A concrete block wall can be laid in less time and may cost up to half as much as a similar brick wall.The concrete blocks are generally made using concrete which is a mixture of powdered Portland cement,water,MSand,and gravel.Concrete blocks are used extensively for both load bearing and non load bearing walls,externally and internally.Concrete Mix Design M 20 Grade Of ConcreteA simple method of concrete mix design based on flexural strength for normal weight concrete mixes is described in the paper.INTRODUCTION: Usual criterion for the strength of concrete in the building industry is the compressive strength,which is considered as a measure of quality concrete.

## Properties Of Concrete What Is Concrete Made Of?
Concrete properties consist of three basic components: water,aggregate (rocks and sand),and portland cement.Cement,usually in powder form,acts as a binding agent when mixed with water and aggregates.This combination or mixture,when poured,hardens into this durable material called concrete that we are all familiar with.Grades of Concrete with Proportion (Mix Ratio) CivilologyGrades of Concrete.Actually,what do we mean by grade of concrete.? Concrete grades are denoted by M10,M20,M30 according to their compressive strength.The "M" denotes Mix design of concrete followed by the compressive strength number in N mm 2
