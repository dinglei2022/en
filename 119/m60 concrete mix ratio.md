## Grade of concrete
If large scale concrete construction is carried out design mix concrete offers mix proportions based on locally available material and thus used in the large scale concrete construction.So,on structural requirements,the suitable grade of concrete is selected and for small scale construction nominal mixes for a grade will like M15,M20 and M25 are used.IS102622009CONCRETE MIX DESIGN civilblogApr 08,2014&nbsp&#0183&#32The following points should be remembered before proportioning a concrete mix a per IS102622009.This method of concrete mix proportioning is applicable only for ordinary and standard concrete grades.The air content in concrete is considered as nil.
