## Open Pit Mining Pros &amp Cons Sciencing
Openpit mining is much safer than shaft mining.In underground mining,the threat of a cavein or release of toxic gas is a constant concern.When shaft mining was the most common method of ore extraction,thousands died in caveins,gas events and accidents involving equipment.In 1907 alone,more than 3,200 deaths related to mining occurred.Openpit mining WikipediaOpenpit mining is to be considered one of the most dangerous sectors in the industrial world.It causes significant effects to miners health,as well as damage to the ecological land.Openpit mining causes changes to vegetation,soil,and bedrock,which ultimately contributes to changes in surface hydrology,groundwater levels,and flow paths.
