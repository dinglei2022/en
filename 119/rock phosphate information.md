## Determination of Phosphate
In the event that the sodium phosphate used is not known,use the 3.96 factor to calculate added phosphate.In the event that the potassium phosphate used is not known,use the 4.82 factor to calculate added phosphate.In the event that a mixture of phosphates is used,use the factor for the phosphate present that will result in the highest value.ROCK PHOSPHATE Egypt GlobeRock Phosphate or Phosphate rock is a nondetrital sedimentary rock which contains high amounts of phosphate bearing minerals.The phosphate content of phosphorite is at least 15 to 20%,which is a large enrichment over the typical sedimentary rock content of less than 0.2%.
