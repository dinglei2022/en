## Hold an iron rod in the North−South direction and hammer.
Your iron rod consists of a huge number of magnetic domains (small clusters of atoms in the crystal structure of the iron rod).They are all pointing in random directions,so they cancel each other out,and the iron rod has no overall magnetic field.KEY CONCEPT Magnetism is a force that acts at a distance.However magnets cannot exert a force on an object that is too far away.A is the region around a magnet in which the magnet exerts force.If a piece of iron is within the magnetic field of a magnet,it will be pulled toward the magnet.Many small pieces of iron,called iron filings,are used to show the magnetic field around a magnet.
