## Gold Cyanide Method ~ Technology Industry Of Gold Mining
Gold cyanide method is a basic method of the gold dissolution process is often used in gold mining around the world,and gold cyanide process has been patented in 1887 The chemical reaction that occurs when the dissolution of gold cyanide is:Metallurgist &amp Mineral Processing EngineerFor its extensive practical experience,911 Metallurgist has a clear understanding of what successful mineral processing engineering is and how to go about achieving it.Your goal is the production of a material that is marketable and returns you and your investors sustainable revenues.

## Gold mining Wikipedia
Gold mining is the resource extraction of gold by mining As of 2017,the world's largest gold producer was China with 4294 tonnThe second largest producer,Australia,mined 2890 tonnes in the same year,followed by Russia with 2723 tonnRemoval of Lead Hydroxides Complexes from Solutions Formed,Cyanidation,a chemical process for gold dissolution,was introduced about 1890 in New Zealand and South Africa It replaced the chlorination method which was in use that time The cyanidation process was patented by MacArthur et al,and cited by Habashi[ 1 ]

## Should cyanide still be used in modernday mining?
Mar 07,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32The first gold bar produced with the thiosulphate process was poured in late 2014.&quotReplacing cyanide with the nontoxic thiosulphate stands to reduce environmental risks and open other opportunities in countries where gold cyanidation is banned,&quot CSIRO team leader for gold processing,Dr Paul Breuer said in June.Bottle Roll Testing for Cyanidation of Gold Ores: ProblemsCyanide leaching of gold is a very common methodology for evaluation of low grade gold ores.Despite risks associated with cyanide,the method proved to be highly effective provided that necessary precautions are taken.Gold cyanidation in field scale is mainly conducted through heap leaching and tank leaching methods.

## Gold and Silver Leaching by Cyanidation
Introduction to Gold and Silver Leaching.The cyanide leaching process is the most important method ever developed for extracting gold from its ores.The early development of the process is attributed to a Scotchman,John Stewart Mac Arthur,in collaboration with the Forrest brothers.The method was introduced into South Africa in 1890.
