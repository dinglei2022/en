## Muscovite Mineral Uses and Properties
Muscovite is the most common mineral of the mica family.It is an important rockforming mineral present in igneous,metamorphic,and sedimentary rocks.Like other micas it readily cleaves into thin transparent sheets.Muscovite sheets have a pearly to vitreous luster on their surface.Transparent Indium Tin Oxide Electrodes on Muscovite MicaSndoped In2O3 (ITO) electrodes were deposited on transparent and flexible muscovite mica.The use of mica substrate makes a hightemperature annealing process (up to 500 &#176C) possible.ITO mica retains its low electric resistivity even after continuous bending of 1000 times on account of the unique layered structure of mica.When used as a transparent flexible heater,ITO mica shows an
