## Chapter 5 : Food Security — Special Report on Climate.
Observed climate change is already affecting food security through increasing temperatures,changing precipitation patterns,and greater frequency of some extreme events (high confidence).Studies that separate out climate change from other factors affecting crop yields have shown that yields of some crops (e.g.maize and wheat) in many lower.SugarcaneA fairly dry,sunny and cool,but frost free season for ripening and harvesting moisture percentage drops steadily throughout the life of the sugarcane plant,from 83% in very young cane to 71% in mature cane,meanwhile sucrose grows from less than 10 to more than 45% of the dry weight.
