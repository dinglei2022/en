A few years ago,I wrote a paper for an essay contest being run by the Fraser Institute,a notoriously right wing think tank in Vancouver.The assignment was to write about a free market solution to an environmental problem,and I suggested that a firm could extract and sell the 450kg of copper leaching out from the Britannia Mine into Howe Sound every day.Copper recovery using leach solvent extractionCopper recovery using leach solvent extraction electrowinning technology 65 (Figure 2) and a alytic amount of LIX 63,was introduced in 19657 and in March 1968 the first commercial copper L SX EW operation,the Bluebird plan of Ranchers
