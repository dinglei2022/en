## The Hidden Costs of Fossil Fuels Union of Concerned
Unlike the extraction and transport stages,in which coal,oil,and natural gas can have very different types of impacts,all fossil fuels emit carbon dioxide and other harmful air pollutants when burned.These emissions lead to a wide variety of public health and environmental costs that are borne at the local,regional,national,and globalFluorine (F) Chemical properties,Health andFluorine in the environment.Annual world production of the mineral fluorite in around 4 million tonnes,and there are around 120 million tonnes of mineral reserves.The main mining areas for fluorite are China,Mexico and Western Europe.Fluorine occurs naturally in the earth's crust where it can be found in rocks,coal and clay.

## Fluorite: The mineral fluorite information and pictures
Fluorite is the only mineral for which significant quantities of the important element fluorine can be obtained.Fluorite is also used as a flux in the manufacture of steel and other metals to eliminate impurities.There is a great demand for Fluorite in the optics field,and to meet it synthetic crystals are grown to produce special lenses.Fluorite WikipediaFluorite (also called fluorspar) is the mineral form of calcium fluoride,CaF 2.It belongs to the halide minerals.It crystallizes in isometric cubic habit,although octahedral and more complex isometric forms are not uncommon.The Mohs scale of mineral hardness,based on scratch hardness comparison,defines value 4 as Fluorite.Fluorite is a colorful mineral,both in visible and ultraviolet
