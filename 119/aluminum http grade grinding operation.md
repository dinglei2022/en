## Chapter 5: Surface Grinder Manufacturing Processes 45
The milder abrasives like 32 and 38 Aluminum Oxide are best for lighter precision grinding operations on steels and semisteels,while the intermediate 57 and 19 Aluminum Oxide abrasives are used for precision and semiprecision grinding of both mild and hard steels.The severity of the grinding operation also influences the choice of grade.Nickel and Nickel Alloys Machining espimetalsFor crush form grinding,vitrifiedbond,mediumgrade aluminum oxide wheels having mediumtoopen structures produce good results.A highgrade grinding oil is recommended and should be continuously filtered through all operations.Abrasive belts (cloth belts coated with aluminum oxide) can be used for finishing group D alloys.
