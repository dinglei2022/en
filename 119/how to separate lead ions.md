## Lead(II) chloride Wikipedia
In solid PbCl 2,each lead ion is coordinated by 9 chloride ions — 6 lie at the apices of a trigonal prism and 3 lie beyond the centers of each prism face.The 9 chloride ions are not equidistant from the central lead atom,7 lie at 280 309 pm and 2 at 370 pm.PbCl 2 forms white orthorhombic needles.While Lead(II) chloride is abundant inIonic Precipitation Reactions in Aqueous SolutionsExperiment: Ionic Precipitation Reactions in Aqueous Solutions Objectives: Identify the ions present in various aqueous solutions.Systematically combine solutions and identify the reactions that form precipitates.For the reactions that involve a precipitate,use

The distance the ion moves up the paper can also be used to identify the ion.However,since students will develop their chromatography experiments for different amounts of time and under slightly different conditions,each student will have somewhat different measured distance for a given ion.7.5: Aqueous Solutions and Solubility CompoundsIn other cases,the electrostatic attractions between the ions in a crystal are so large,or the iondipole attractive forces between the ions and water molecules are so weak,that the increase in disorder cannot compensate for the energy required to separate the ions,and the crystal is insoluble.
