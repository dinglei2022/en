## ACI METHOD OF PROPORTIONING CONCRETE MIXES
ACI METHOD OF PROPORTIONING CONCRETE MIXES The ACI Standard 211.1 is a "Recommended Practice for Selecting Proportions for Concrete".The procedure is as follows: Step 1.Choice of slump Step 2.Choice of maximum size of aggregate Step 3.Estimation of mixing water and air content Step 4.Selection of water cement ratio Step 5.CONCRETE MIX DESIGN TECHNICIAN STUDY GUIDEThese moisture calculations are to be recorded,documented and stored with the producer's copy of the batch The Concrete Mix Design database is a plantbyplant list of mix designs accepted for each plant.Data on each mix design includes mix number,class,proportions,mix properties,material sources,and material properties.Acceptance

An example of proportioning a mix design through use of this form is detailed in Table 3.1.The contractor establishes the initial parameters for a mix design and serves as the starting point for subsequent proportioning calculations.The initial step in proportioning the mix design is to calculate the water content per cubic yard of concrete.Concrete Mix Design Calculation The ConstructorConcrete mix design is the process of finding right proportions of cement,sand and aggregates for concrete to achieve target strength in structures.So,concrete mix design can be stated as Concrete Mix = Cement:Sand:Aggregates.The concrete mix design involves various steps,calculations and

## Materials and Mix Design Pervious concrete
Materials and Mix Design.Pervious concrete uses the same materials as conventional concrete,with the exceptions that the fine aggregate typically is eliminated entirely,and the size distribution (grading) of the coarse aggregate is kept narrow,allowing for relatively little particle packing.
