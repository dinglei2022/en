## Impact Crusher Working Principle
Starting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them.Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic.An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).Vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushers MetsoVertical shaft impact (VSI) crushers are generally used in the last phase of the crushing circuit.Metso's family of VSI crushers is called Barmac&#174 B Series™ VSI crushers.Due to their ability to produce precisely shaped end products,Barmac&#174 B Series™ VSI crushers are most popular among aggregates producers,construction industry and
