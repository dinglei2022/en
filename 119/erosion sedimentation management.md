2015 Maryland Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Standards and Specifiions for Forest Harvest Operations The Departments of Environment and Natural Resources are pleased to announce the issuance of the 2015 Maryland Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Standards and Specifiions for Forest Harvest Operations (Manual).A draft Manual was published in 2005 but never finalized.Soil Erosion &amp Sedimentation Control Environmental ServicesThe Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Program investigates potential loss of soils and landscape through ongoing and proposed construction activities.Any earth changes which are the result of development of previously undisturbed areas may cause large amounts of soil and sediment to enter the waters of the state.

## Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Overview ddoe
Soil erosion and sediment control minimizes erosion and prevents sediment pollution from entering the Potomac River,This is a requirement of the 2013 Rule on Stormwater Management and Soil Erosion and Sediment Control (2013 SW Rule) which calls for the prominent posting of a sign that:EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION MANAGEMENTErosion and sedimentation management is a critical compliance issue for all main road construction projects.Construction activities can disturb soils,change landforms and alter natural drainage patterns.These disturbances,if not managed properly throughout all stages of a project,can result in soil erosion
