## Plastic Machining Tips East Coast Precision Manufacturing
Plastic machining is both an art and a science.Plastics can change dimensionally due to humidity,temperature and machining process and there is an "art" to.How Plastics Are MadeCompression Molding This process has a prepared volume of plastic placed into a mold cavity and then a second mold or plug is applied to squeeze the plastic into the desired shape.The plastic can be a semicured thermoset,such as an automobile tire,or a thermoplastic or a mat of thermoset resin and long glass fibers,such as for a boat hull.
