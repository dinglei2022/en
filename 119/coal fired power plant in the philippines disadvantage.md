## Mapped: The world's coal power plants in 2019
2010419&ensp&#0183&enspSince 2000,the world has doubled its coalfired power capacity to around 2,000 gigawatts (GW) after explosive growth in China and India.A further 236GW is being built and 336GW is planned.More recently,227GW has closed due to a wave of retirements across theNatural gas and its advantages Shell GlobalIt is versatile.A gasfired power station takes much less time to start and stop than a coalfired plant.This flexibility makes it a good partner to renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind,which are only available when the sun shines and the wind blows.
