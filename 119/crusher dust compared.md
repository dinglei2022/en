## Effect of Size and Gradation of Crusher Stone and Crusher.
crusher dust shows that it consists of 92% of sand size and 4% of silt size particles.It is equally dominated by particles of coarse,medium and fine sand sizes with rough surface texture.Based on BIS,it is classified as well graded particles with non plastic fines (SW) with C u as 10.83 and C.1 2 inch minus gravel compared crusher dustBecause even if you clear down to hard pan,put a layer of 3″ minus rock,then 4 inches of 3 4inch minus gravel,and 2 inches of 1 4″ minus or crusher dust it still sinks! And next year,I had to spend another $2K to spread 3 4inch minus gravel on top.
