## Calcium fluoride Wikipedia
Calcium fluoride is the inorganic compound of the elements calcium and fluorine with the formula CaF 2.It is a white insoluble solid.It occurs as the mineral fluorite (also called fluorspar),which is often deeply coloured owing to impurities.Calcium Fluoride Windows thorlabsCalcium fluoride has a low absorption coefficient and high damage threshold,making these windows a good choice for use with freespace lasers.Optical calcium fluoride offers low dispersion (with an Abbe Number of 95) and low fluorescence,as well as excellent water,chemical,and heat resistance.
