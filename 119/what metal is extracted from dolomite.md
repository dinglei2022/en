Dolomite is also a good source of magnesium metal.The magnesium metal is extracted from dolomite by the wellknown ferosilicon process.Dolomite decomposes completely above 900&#186C.The product resulting from this relatively lowtemperature calcination is highly porous and reactive and is known as 'calcinated dolomite'.Dolomite Metalcess works for whole metal lifecycleHowever,the tin concentrate grade of 40% is required,meaning the enrichment of hundreds or thousands times.Targeting at the refractory tin ore,low grade tin concentrate is obtained and it has to be further extracted by special metallurgy process.Reduction smelting is the dominant process to extract tin metal from tin concentrate.

## How are metals extracted by carbon? AnswersDrive
A metal ore is a rock containing a metal,or a metal compound,in a high enough concentration to make it economic to extract the metal.For example,reactive metals such as aluminium are extracted by electrolysis,while a lessreactive metal such as iron may be extractedWhere do metals come from sdauk2013919&ensp&#0183&enspWhere do metals come from? Most pure metals,like aluminium,silver and copper,come from the Earth's crust.They are found in ores solid materials called minerals,usually occurring in rock,from which the pure metal has to be extracted.The properties of pure metals can be improved by mixing them with other metals to make alloys.
