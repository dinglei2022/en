## Improvement of the solubility of rock phosphate by co
phosphate rock solubility,perhaps worth more attention,is by cocomposting it with organic matter.Products of the metabolism of microorganisms which decompose organic matter break down phosphate,releasing plant available phosphate compounds.The improved solubility of phosphorus achieved by cocomposting is a resultPhosphoric Acid Essential Chemical IndustryPhosphoric acid is produced from fluorapatite,known as phosphate rock,3Ca 3 (PO 4) 2CaF 2,by the addition of concentrated (93%) sulfuric acid in a series of well stirred reactors This results in phosphoric acid and calcium sulfate (gypsum) plus other insoluble impuriti
