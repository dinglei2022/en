3.CarbonInLeach (CIL): The carboninleach process integrates leaching and carboninpulp into a single unit process operation.Leach tanks are fitted with carbon retention screens and the CIP tanks are eliminated.Carbon is added in leach so that the gold is adsorbed onto carbon almost as soon as it is dissolved by the cyanide solution.Gold CIL &amp CIP Gold Leaching Process Explained CCDCIL stands for carboninleach.This is a gold extraction process called cyanidation where carbon is added to the leach tanks (or reaction vessel) so that leaching and adsorption take place in the same tanks.CIL is slightly different from another gold extraction process called CIP or carboninpulp process.
