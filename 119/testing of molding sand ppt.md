SAND MOULDING GENERAL DESCRIPTION Sand casting,the most widely used casting process,utilizes expendable sand molds to form complex metal parts that can be made of nearly any alloy.Because the sand mold must be destroyed in order to remove the part,called the casting,sand casting typically has a low production rate.SandSand is a naturally occurring granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles.the most common constituent of sand is silica (silicon dioxide,or SiO2),usually in the form of quartz.
