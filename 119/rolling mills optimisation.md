## Rolling (metalworking) Wikipedia
A tandem mill is a special type of modern rolling mill where rolling is done in one pass.In a traditional rolling mill rolling is done in several passes,but in tandem mill there are several stands (&gt=2 stands) and reductions take place successively.The number of stands ranges from 2 to 18.Optimisation of the Bearings in a Hot Rolling MillHot wide strip rolling mills process red hot slabs into steel strip using a high rolling pressure.An international steel processing company operates such a rolling mill in Europe,which produces steel strip with a thickness of up to 13 mm.The steel is rolled into coils which may weigh more than 30 tonnes.These coils are then used,for.
