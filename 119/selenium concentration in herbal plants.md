## Selenium — Health Professional Fact Sheet
The selenium content of soil affects the amounts of selenium in the plants that animals eat,so the quantities of selenium in animal products also vary [2,5].However,selenium concentration in soil has a smaller effect on selenium levels in animal products than in plantbased foods because animals maintain predictable tissue concentrations ofA chemometric approach to distribution of selenium in,The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of selenium (Se) in common raw plant materials (herbs,leaves,flowers,fruits,and roots) obtained from medicinal plants cultivated in Poland Furthermore,the relationship between the morphological part of a plant and its species was examined,and the concentration of Se in it was measured

## Selenium Toxicity to Plants biocyclopedia
Selenium toxicity is influenced by plant type,form of selenium in the growth medium,and presence of competing ions such as sulfate and phosphate.Interestingly,there are no written reports of selenium toxicity under cultivated conditions.This result may be because most crop plants show no injury or yield suppression until they accumulate at least 300 mg Se kg1,which is usually more thanSelenium concentration in St.John&#39s wort (.200939 Selenium concentration in St.Johns wort ( Hypericum perforatum L.) herb after foliar spraying of young plants under different UV B radiat.
