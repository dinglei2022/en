## Iron Simple English Wikipedia,the free encyclopedia
Iron is made in large factories called ironworks by reducing hematite with carbon (coke).This happens in large containers called blast furnaces.The blast furnace is filled with iron ore,coke and limestone.A very hot blast of air is blown in,where it causes the coke to burn.
