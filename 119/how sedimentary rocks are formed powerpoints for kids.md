## How Do Rocks Form? Reference
Rocks are formed in three primary ways,and each method produces rocks with different characteristics.Rocks are either classified as sedimentary,igneous or metamorphic,depending on the manner in which they were formed.Most rocks encountered in everyday life are sedimentary,although some igneous rocks,such as granite,are also common.Sedimentary Rocks Lesson PlanApr 25,2010&nbsp&#0183&#32Goal(s): Students will develop an understanding of how sedimentary rocks are formed.Grade level(s): 45 Objective(s): Students will be able to identify a sedimentary rock by its visual markings (lines layers).Students will be able to explain how sedimentary rocks are formed (through erosion and the compressing cementing of smaller rocks and plant animal material).

Sedimentary rocks are the most common rock types which are freely exposed on the earth's surface.They are formed from other rock materials since they are made up from the buildup of weathered and eroded preexisting rocks.The weathering,erosion and the eventual compaction of igneous,metamorphic or formerly structured sedimentary rocks among other biological sedimentations leadsPowerPoint Presentation Geology Eduor AlAn effective writer may consider the following points: name the three types of rocks describe and or draw each type of rock name two ways each type of rock can be identified show how soils are formed and classified describe the rock cycle,* describe how one rock type may become another * explain why the rock cycle is a cycle.
