## Bituminous coal Wikipedia
Bituminous coal is an organic sedimentary rock formed by diagenetic and sub metamorphic compression of peat bog material.Its primary constituents are macerals: vitrinite,and liptinite.The carbon content of bituminous coal is around 60 80% the rest is composed of water,air,hydrogen,and sulfur,which have not been driven off from theCHAPTER 4 PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS 4.1 Fly Ashcoalbase thermal plants.The coal used in India is predominantly bituminous,which gives rise to lowlime fly ash.Subbituminous lignite coal,used in some power plants gives highlime fly ash.In view of their large scale availability,lowlime fly ashes are mainly used in India and elsewhere.

## Fly Ash Classifiion Old and New Ideas
bituminous coal fly ash values,as i n the example of the southern U.S.lignites,coal ashes are sold as Class F and,although they contain more lime than is typical for fly ashes from bituminous coals,they are similar in performance to high rank coal ashes and have no self cementing properties.USGS Fact Sheet 07601: Coal Combustion ProductsCoal combustion products (CCP's) are the inorganic residues that remain after pulverized coal is burned.Coarse particles (bottom ash and boiler slag) settle to the bottom of the combustion chamber),and the fine portion (fly ash,fig.1) is removed from the flue gas by electrostatic precipitators or other gasscrubbing systems.

## HIGH CARBON FLY ASH FINDS USES IN HIGHWAY
In general,withinspec fly ash is referred to as Class C and Class F fly ash.Combustion of bituminous or anthracite coal produces Class F (low calcium) fly ash and combustion of lignite or subbituminous coal produces Class C (high calcium) fly ash.Class F fly ash is pozzolanic while Class C fly ash is both selfcementitious and pozzolanic.Reference Materials and Standards for Fossil Fuels NISTNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) fossil fuel Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) continue to be in high demand by the petroleum industry and the fossil fuelbased electric utility industries.In the past,the measurement of sulfur in fuels and combustion systems has received principal attention,but mercury emissions are now attracting regulatory interest

## Coal Ash Basics Coal Ash (Coal Combustion Residuals,or
Coal ash,also referred to as coal combustion residuals or CCRs,is produced primarily from the burning of coal in coalfired power plants.Coal ash includes a number of byproducts produced from burning coal,including: Fly Ash,a very fine,powdery material composed mostly of silica made from the burning of finely ground coal in a boiler.INFLUENCE OF FLYASH AS A FILLER IN BITUMINOUS MIXESA study has been carried out in this study to explore the use of fly ash,a byproduct of a coal based thermal power plant in bituminous paving mixes.For comparison,control mixes with cement and stone dust have also been waste dust,coal fly ash,and steel slag dust increases the stiffness and fatigue life of Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA)
