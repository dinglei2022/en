## US8109265B1 Suction recirculation device for stabilizing,
A suction recirculation device for stabilizing the flow of a curtain of blackened heat absorption particles falling inside of a solar receiver with an open aperture The curtain of particles absorbs the concentrated heat from a solar mirror array reflected up to the receiver on a solar power tower External winds entering the receiver at an oblique angle can destabilize the particle curtain.Cyclone Separators Selection Guide Engineering360cyclone designs,hence using the inlets velocity a cyclone dimension can be determined Keywords: Cyclone,Inlet velocity,pressure drop,sizing I INTRODUCTION Cyclone separator is a method of removing particulate from an air,gas or liquid stream without the use of filters,through vortex separation

## CFD SIMULATION OF A SINGLE PHASE FLOW IN A PIPE,
The separation process in cyclone occurs in an extremely short residence time such that there is no opportunity for significant heat exchange with the surroundings (Almgren et al,2006) Therefore,a flow in pipe separator is with low dissipation (indicated by lowDepartment of Energy slideshow (interesting)Aug 23,2015&#0183;&#32;It would be interesting to hear any sort of presentation that went along with the visuals Or read anything that had been prepared It is hard to take away too much from the slides,but I did think the separation efficiency of the differing models was valuable
