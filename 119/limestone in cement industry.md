## Understanding Limestone in Cement Concrete Construction
Mar 26,2015&nbsp&#0183&#32The limestone acts as a seed crystal for the cement,better distributing the reaction products and increasing the reactivity of the cement.As there is always unhydrated cement in the concrete,this change will have no real measurable effect on the use of fly ash.The cement might have a reduced water demand,and the coarser cement gradationHow can you turn limestone to cement answersPowdered limestone has to be heated with powdered clay to turn it into to cement.You can then use cement and powder it,then mix with water,sand crushed rock and a slow reaction takes place

Cement Industry: Limestone containing about 45% CaO and above is usually preferred for the manufacture of cement.Magnesia content in the stone should ideally be less than 3%,although as high as 5% MgO is used by the industry.Limestone: The Calcium Carbonate Chemical Sedimentary RockLimestone,as used by the minerals industry,is any rock composed mostly of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Although limestone is common in many parts of the United States,it is critically absent from some.Limestone is used to produce Portland cement,as aggregate in concrete and asphalt,and in an
