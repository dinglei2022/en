## Basalt fibers as a sustainable and cost effective,
Although the manufacturing process of basalt fibers (BF) is similar to that of glass fibers (GF),ie fiber drawing or spinning,no additives are required in BF manufacturing as pure basalt rock is the only raw material for fiber productionBasalt Technology,home of StoneRod fibre productsThe fibre is formed from pure basalt rock The process consists of melting the rock at high temperatures,before being drawn through minute sizing di The ore is fed through a weighing and conveying system,into the smelting furnace and the material is,

## Basalt Fibers: Alternative to Glass? TRID
Continuous fibers extruded from basalt are being investigated as a replacement for other types of fibers fibers This article describes the manufacturing process for basalt fibers and discusses some of their potential uses and advantag The continuous process used for producing basalt fibers is.FRACTURE BEHAVIOUR OF THE BASALT FIBRE2012925&ensp&#0183&enspThis fibre behaviour can play a certain role in forming the microstructure of the pyrolysed CBF reinforced composites,because the latter are subjected to varying temperature and stress fields during manufacture.In this way,mechanical properties of the pyrolysed composites can be affected by parameters of the manufacturing process.
