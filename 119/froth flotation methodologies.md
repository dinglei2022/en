## Why is the froth flotation method only used for sulphide ores.
The single most important operation used for the recovery and upgrading of sulphide ore.Only sulphide ores are concentrated by froth flotation process because pine oil selectively wets the sulphide ore and hence brings it to the froth.Froth Flotation of Iron Ores sapubWith the depleting reserves of highgrade iron ore in the world,froth flotation has become increasingly important to process intermediate and lowgrade iron ore in an attempt to meet the rapidly growing demand on the international market.In over half a century's practice in the iron ore industry,froth flotation has been established as an efficient method to remove impurities from iron ore.
