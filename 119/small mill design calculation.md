Calculation of the power draw of dry multi compartment ball mills 225 The mill load that is the volume of charge in the mill is the principal determinant of power draw.Estimation of the ball load that is mixed with the cement charge is difficult and can be highly erroneous.So direct mesmall ball mill design calculationMill Speed.No matter how large or small a mill,ball mill,ceramic lined mill,pebble mill,jar mill or laboratory jar rolling mill,its rotational speed is important to proper and efficient mill operation.Too low a speed and little energy is imparted on the product.
