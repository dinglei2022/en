## THE EXTRACTION OF METALS AN INTRODUCTION
This is a common extraction process for the more reactive metals for example,for aluminium and metals above it in the electrochemical series.You may also come across it in other cases such as one method of extracting copper and in the purifiion of copper.How Are Metals Extracted From Their Ores? ReferenceHowever,all sources of aluminum are not equal.Due to the high cost of refining and the relatively low value of the metal,extraction is limited to bauxite,an aluminum ore containing 50 to 70 percent of aluminum oxide.Copper ores generally contain sulfides or oxides and copper
