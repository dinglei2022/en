## Cone Crushers
Cone crushers are used in AG and SAG grinding circuits to increase tonnage by effectively dealing with any pebble (critical size) build up problem.Normally,heavy duty short head crushers are employed to crush pebbles.Power and crusher cavity level are the key variables for monitoring and controlling the crusher operation.Taurian EngineeringCone Crushers are mostly secondary stage reducers,though used in tertiary and quaternary stages in high capacity crushing plants.Our cone crushers have large feed size opening (to accept odd oversized material coming out of jaw crusher),and a large setting range to ensure that customer gets what he wants 0 20m
