## Study on the Design of Venturi Scrubber on Metal Mine
Venturi scrubber is a highefficiency wet dust collector,and has a high capture efficiency for small solid particles.Applied to metal mines,the venturi scrubber not only eliminate the mine dust in the processes of mining and driving,but also can capture the diesel exhaust particles effectively in theory.Then the air in the mine has been purified and the staff can keep away from the harm ofLime Limestone Wet Scrubbing System for Flue,Lime Limestone Wet Scrubbing System for Flue Gas Desulfurization Background Process Instrumentation Wet scrubbers are used in,
