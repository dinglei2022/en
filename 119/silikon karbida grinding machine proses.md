## GRINDING WHEEL and ABRASIVES BASICS
It is used in tumbling processes as a surface finishing product.Also,manufacturers will often blend a small percentage of silicon carbide in with aluminum oxide grit in grinding wheels and honing stones to achieve a better workpiece surface finish on steels.Silicon Carbide Precision CeramicsSilicon Carbide Machining &amp Grinding.Silicon Carbide can be machined in green,biscuit,or fully dense states.While in the green or biscuit form it can be machined relatively easily into complex geometries.However,the sintering process that is required to fully densify the material causes the Silicon Carbide body to shrink approximately 20%.
