Control and removal of trace elements may be a much more difficult problem.When coal is burned directly,most of the trace elements are recovered in either the bottom ash or the fly ash.Extensive research has shown,however,that many trace elements are released and their buildup in areas downwind from the plant can be carefully analyzed.8： dearbaba 1666 CSDN2018627&ensp&#0183&ensp&lt?php Plugin 8: Spell Check This is an executable example with additional code supplied To obtain just the plugins please click on the Download link
