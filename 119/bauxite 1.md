The bauxite ore contains aluminum trihydrate (Al(OH) 3).Alumina refining produces alumina (Al 2 O 3) from the bauxite ore,by exploiting the reversible reaction of the Bayer process 1 3: The reaction is firstly driven in the sodium aluminate (NaAlO 2) direction by the addition of caustic soda (NaOH) to bauxite.Bauxite residues are thenDetermination of Bauxite's phases by the bomb digest(1972) defined bauxite ore as bauxite that is economically mineable at present or in the foreseeable future,containing not less than 45 50% Al2O3,and not more than 20% Fe2O3 and 3 5% combined silica.In terms of the geological field exploration for bauxite,the quantities and topological distribution
