There are two main problems with concrete in cold weather: Concrete can freeze before it gains strength which breaks up the matrix; Concrete sets more slowly when it is cold—very slow below 50&#176;F; below 40&#176;F the hydration reaction basically stops and the concrete doesn't gain strength But these are concrete temperatures not air temperaturFLY ASH CONCRETE ADMIXTURE jsce.or.jp2019321&ensp&#0183&enspas a concrete additive is about 200,000 tons,so the former is 15 times larger than the latter.[1] The reason for this imbalance is that a dedied silo is required in readymixed concrete plants when it is used as an additive,with the result that GGBS as an additive is mainly limited to largescale construction work or factory products.

## Influence of cement and expansive additive types in the
However,the reduction in strength does not depend so much on the additive dosage but on the total expansion.Thus,up to certain threshold,it appears that increased additive dosages do not affect substantially the concrete strength.Increased expansive additive contents result in higher final expansions for both free and restrained concretes.Early High Strength Concrete Advantages and ChallengesHigh Strength concrete is also one of them The history of high strength concrete is about 35 years old,in late 1960s the invention of water reducing admixtures lead to the high strength precast products and structural elements in beam were cast in situ using high strength concrete

## CIP 27 Cold Weather Concreting
CIP 27 Cold Weather Concreting WHY Consider Cold Weather? WHAT is Cold Weather? Cold weather is defined as a period when the average daily temperature falls below 40&#176;F [4&#176;C] for more than three successive days These conditions warrant spe cial precautions when placing,finishing,curing and protecting concrete against the effects of cold.
