## Determining the optimal dispersant loading for pigments,
There are many different dispersant chemistries available to the formulator Some will be much more effective than others at dispersing particular pigments in aqueous or non aqueous systems This article offers tips on how to optimise the loading of a suitable dispersing agent,as the amount of dispersant required to fully cover the surface of a pigment or filler will varyGuidance about hazardous chemicals Department of MinesGuidance about hazardous chemicals Online Systems.Hazardous chemicals and dangerous goods used at mining operations in Western Australia are regulated by the Resources Safety Division of the Department of Mines,Industry Regulation and Safety.
