## What is Expanded Clay Aggregate? Definition from
Expanded or expandable clay aggregate is a commonly used hydroponic grow medium.It is a lightweight aggregate that is heated in a kiln oven to a temperature of 2,910 degrees Fahrenheit (1,200 degrees Celsius).Once the aggregate is heated,it releases gases,which create small bubbles that make a honeycomblike structure inside of the aggregate.Expanded Clay EC21LECA (Light Weight Expanded Clay Aggregate) is an aggregate made of expanded clay at average 1200â„ƒ in rotary kiln,the Yielding gases are expanded by thousands of small bubbles as long as this temperature and porosity will appear by many voids and honeycombs at these round shape aggregates when melted materials become cold.
