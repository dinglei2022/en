The continuous casting process for steel is shown in Fig.1 (second frame) and the closeup of the upper mold region is shown in Fig.2.In this process,molten steel flows from a ladle,through a tundish into the mold.The tundish holds enough metal to provide a continuous flow to the mold,even during an exchange of ladles,which are supplied periodically from the steelmaking process.About NLMK UralNLMK Ural’s operations are located at three production sites in the Sverdlovsk region: an EAF plant in Revda and long products plants in Nizhniye Sergi and Beryozovsky.The electric steelmaking plant in Revda has two VAI electric arc furnaces,two ladle furnaces,VAI and Concast,and two continuous casting machines,Concast and Pomini.The plant manufactures 125Х125 mm continuous cast.
