## Considerations for Selecting Valves for Lime Slurry,
By Todd Loudin Lime is widely used in the municipal water industry and can be very difficult to manage because of scale formation Valves and related equipment used in lime slurry service need to be selected carefully to limit system maintenance and the potential for system failureSlurry hoses MetsoRubber slurry hoses are used for sections of slurry hose systems containing bends,differences in levels and unevenness.The flexible rubber hose can be easily adjusted to different lengths,or,to a certain degree,bent to requirements.For the recommended bend radius,see our alogue Slurry Hose System Design Manual.
