## no detectable Fukushima cesium How Radioactive is Our Ocean
It has now been six years since the March 2011 tsunami off Japan damaged the Fukushima Dai ichi Nuclear Power Plant and resulted in unprecedented releases of cesium 134,cesium 137,and many other gaseous and volatile radioactive elements to the Pacific Ocean.From the early days of the disaster,we have tracked&nbsp;.Cesium: Health Benefits,Uses,Side Effects,DosageNonradioactive cesium is also used to treat depression.Healthcare providers sometimes treat cancer patients with radioactive cesium (cesium137).In industry,radioactive cesium is also used in instruments that measure thickness,moisture,and liquid flow.

## Fukushima&#39;s Radioactive Ocean Water Arrives At West Coast
24 Feb 2014.Two radioactive cesium isotopes,cesium 134 and cesium 137,have been detected offshore of Vancouver,British Columbia,researchers said at a news conference.Fukushima&#39;s radiation reached coastal Canada first because of the powerful Kuroshio Current,which flows from Japan across the Pacific.Fukushima&#39;s Radioactive Water Leak: What You Should Know9 Aug 2013.Buesseler said the initial leak had a high concentration of cesium isotopes,but the water flowing from the plant into the ocean now is likely to be proportionally much higher in strontium 90,another radioactive substance that is absorbed differently by the human body and has different risks.The tanks (on the&nbsp;.

## Estimation of radioactive 137 cesium transportation by litterfall.
To predict the future dynamics of radioactive cesium (137Cs) in the forest catchment,it is important to measure each component of its movement within the forest.Two years after the accident,we estimated the annual transportation of 137Cs from the forest canopy to the floor by litterfall,throughfall and stemflow.Seasonal&nbsp;.QSA Global Cesium 137 QSA GlobalThickness Gauging Cesium 137 is used in the measurement of light alloys,glass,plastics,and rubber for which beta sources are not suitable.Flow Gauging Cesium and a detector are placed on opposite sides of the material to be measured.Gamma radiation transmitted through the sample is then directed related to&nbsp;.

## Caesium137 Wikipedia
Caesium137 (137 55 Cs),or radiocaesium,is a radioactive isotope of caesium which is formed as one of the more common fission products by the nuclear fission of uranium235 and other fissionable isotopes in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons.It is among the most problematic of the shorttomediumlifetime fission products because it easily moves and spreads in nature due to the high waterUnderstanding Shipping Labels and Placards for RadioactiveOnly Radioactive YellowII and Radioactive YellowIII labels must show the transport index.Radioactive YellowII label can be used for up to 1.0 mrem hr @1 meter.The transport index is determined by taking the maximum radiation level (as measured in mrem hr) at one meter (3.3 feet) from an undamaged package.See photo below.
