## In vitro DISSOLUTION OF ACIDULATED ROCK …
The low availability of phosphorus (P) in the soil and the high cost of P fertilization are factors that limit agricultural productivity.A biotechnological alternative for to handle this problem is to use soil microorganisms capable of dissolving rock phosphate (RP),thus improving its …TAS Phosphate RockPhosphorene,phosphate rock or rock phosphate is a nondetrital sedimentary rock which contains high amounts of phosphate minerals.The phosphate content of phosphorite (or grade of phosphate rock) varies greatly,from 4%[1] to 20% phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5).
