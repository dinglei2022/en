## Lab Equipments Flakiness Manufacturer from Ahmedabad
In bituminous mixtures,flaky aggregates make for a harsh mix and may also crack and break up during compacting by rolling.The flakiness of aggregate is determined by measuring the thickness of individual particles.Hence we offer thickness gauge and length gauge to check flakiness and elongation index of the aggregate respectivelyPavement materials: AggregatesOne of the model in which pavement material can fail is by crushing under compressive stress.A test is standardized by IS:2386 part IV and used to determine the crushing strength of aggregates.The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of
