## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,sand or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.VSI CrusherWe have developed a VSI Crusher having capacity 30 Tons per hour to250 tons per hour,with a feed size up to 40 mm to 100 mm.Generally the grit below 6 mm size for Rotopactor is not available in ample quantity.To supply grit below 6mm,above 30 tons per hour
