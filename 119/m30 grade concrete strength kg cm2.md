## What is c30 grade concrete in psi answers
concrete grade and strength are both revalent since if grade increase setting time will be less and curing to be done propely so that concrete strength will reach higher.we use M30 gradeconcrete grades please Civil Environmental engineeringAug 09,2007&nbsp&#0183&#32the concrete grade actualy specifies the cube strenght in 28 days.grade 30(G30)means 30N mm2 strenght whereas the concrete mix ratios stands for cement ratio to sand to coarse aggregate.but i still wonder if we can achieve such cube strenghts by merely following these mix ratios.

## Designing Concrete Mixtures Civil Engineering
Designing Concrete Mixtures There are three phases in the development of a concrete mixture: specifying,designing,and proportioning consistency is obtained,the strength of concrete at a given age depends on the w c ratio.The lower the w c ratio,the higher the concrete strength.
