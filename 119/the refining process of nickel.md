Nickel is separated from the cobalt by the ammoniacal solvent extraction (ASX) process.The ASX technology was developed at the Refinery and installed in 1989.This process,which carries international patents,has significantly improved the original separation process and has enabled the production of nearpure nickel and cobalt products.OVERVIEW OF PGM PROCESSINGConcentration Smelting &amp Converting Refining •Rely on third party PGM refiners •Smelting associated with the huge nickel infrastructure • Recoveries associated with Nickel •Outsourced PGM refining to Heraeus •Excess base metal outsources to AAP and Empress as nickel sulphate •Furnace reliability challenging due to
