## Transfer Chute Design Modelling Gulf Conveyor Systems
Transfer Chute design modelling.Keeping the expensive scaled down.Dealing with expensive capital equipment can be to say the least,expensive.Knowing a design concept will perform to expectations once it has been built and installed is critical.Modelling and design of complete conveyor transfersinvestigated consists of a hood and spoon,Figure 5(b),which is loed directly after the first conveyor.Variable speed drives control the three conveyors independently and a maximum belt speed of 7m s can be achieved.Both the hood and spoon are fully adjustable and lined with 6 mm Polystone Ultra to minimise chute wear and frictional losses.

## minimizing belt wear and damage from optimized chute design
conveyor belts can be damaged from impacting large rocks.Top cover may suffer excessive wear from accelerating the material to belt speed by friction.Wet,sticky material often plugs the chute,which also causes belt damage.Using Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) analysis,the transfer chute design can be optimized in.MECH6250 Course Details Course Handbook The University ofAssessment items.Written Assignment: Assignment #1 Dense Phase Pneumatic Conveying Design.Written Assignment: Assignment #2 Belt Conveyor Design.Written Assignment: Assignment #3 Transfer Chute Design&nbsp
