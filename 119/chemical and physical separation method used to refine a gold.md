## Methods of Purifying Gold Cash for gold Toronto
Gold Purifiion Using Electricity.The use of electricity is one of the latest methods used for purifying gold.This process is commonly referred to as the Wohlwill process.Using this method,the impure gold is placed in a solution made up of gold chloride and hydrochloric acid.What is the difference between a chemical process and a2019717&ensp&#0183&enspThere is no real difference between a chemical process and a physical process in chemistry.Some chemistry teachers like to define a chemical process as any process that involves a chemical reaction and all other processes as physical processes.
