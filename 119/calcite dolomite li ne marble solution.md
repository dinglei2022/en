## Calcite and Dolomite University of Pittsburgh
Calcite and dolomite are very similar minerals.Both have the same hardness (H = 3),the same rhombohedral cleavage,and are found in identical geologic settings.The best way to tell one from the other is the acid test: a drop of 1 M HCl on calcite produces an instant,obvious fizz a drop on dolomite produces slow or no obvious bubbling.StoneTech Care InstructionsPolished Marble Unpolished,Honed,and Textured Marble Marble is a crystalline rock composed predominately of one or more of the following materials: calcite,dolomite,or serpentine,and capable of taking a polish.Polished Terrazzo and Agglomerate Marble Agglomerate marble is a manmade product fabried to look like quarried marble stone.

## Dolomite an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Dolomite.Dolomite is a difficult precipitate to form experimentally at low temperatures and is not found in abundance in modern marine environments,being most common in unique environmental settings and typically forming from compositionally modified seawater solutions at warm temperatures.Dolomite Mineral Uses and PropertiesThe uses and properties of the mineral Dolomite.What is Dolomite? Dolomite is a common rockforming mineral.It is a calcium magnesium carbonate with a chemical composition of CaMg(CO 3) 2.It is the primary component of the sedimentary rock known as dolostone and the metamorphic rock known as dolomitic marble.Limestone that contains some dolomite is known as dolomitic limestone.
