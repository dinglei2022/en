When material enters one end of your hose and piping systems and leaves the other,pressure drop,or pressure loss,occurs Pressure drop is a result of the friction from fluids,solids,liquids,or gasses rubbing against the interior walls of the hose assembly during transfer,and can be estimated with.

## Pressure drop Wikipedia
2019720&ensp&#0183&enspPressure drop is defined as the difference in total pressure between two points of a fluid carrying network.A pressure drop occurs when frictional forces,caused by the resistance to flow,act on a fluid as it flows through the tube.The main determinants of resistance to fluid flow are fluid velocity through the pipe and fluid viscosityUnderstanding water pressure No water low pressure …Understanding water pressure Water pressure is a measure of the force that gets the water through our mains and into your pipes.It is measured in 'bars' one bar is the force needed to raise water to a height of 10 metres.We need pressure to push water through.
