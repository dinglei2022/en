## Difference Between Clarifier and Thickener
201983&ensp&#0183&enspThe Difference Between a Clarifier and a Thickener is subtle as they will visually look the same.Fundamentally,thickeners and clarifiers are both used to settle solids which results in the separation of liquids and solids.Thickeners are used to concentrate solids,while clarifiers are used to purify liquids.A thickener will give you a high density underflow while a clarifier will not.Principle of Efficient Deep Cone Thickener XinhaiIts processing capacity is 38 times that of traditional thickening equipment,the quality of overflow water totally reaches the national emission standard,and the underflow density is up to 300800g L.Efficient deep cone thickener is mainly composed of circular thickening tank and rake scraper.Under the action of gravity,the flocculated

The circular class of high capacity thickener is similar in general form to a conventional circular basin thickener,but cylinder diameters are limited to between 4 and 18 m (see Figure 1.4).Units are constructed from steel and include a cylindrical top portion,an inverted cone bottom section and an angled rake system mounted on a centralChapter 5 Sludge treatment site.iugaza.edu.ps2011910&ensp&#0183&enspGravity thickening is achieved in circular tanks similar to sedimentation tanks.Sludge is allowed to settle and compact.The thickened sludge is withdrawn from the bottom of the thickener.To improve thickening some chemicals are added,this process is called sludge conditioning.Sludge conditioning is discussed below.
