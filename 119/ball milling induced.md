## FULL PAPER eng.ox.ac.uk
Evidence of the ballmillinginduced amorphisation of evacuated ZIF69 and ZIFmnIm was collected (Figure S3b in the Supporting Information),thus underlining the susceptibility of the ZIF family as a whole to facile amorphisation[9] due to their low shear moduli.[8] To maintain consistency with previous publiions,the materials amorphisedMechanochemical Reactions of Lithium Niobate Induced byLithium niobate (LiNbO3,LN) nanocrystals were prepared by ballmilling of the crucible residue of a Czochralski grown congruent single crystal,using a Spex 8000 Mixer Mill with different types of vials (stainless steel,alumina,tungsten carbide) and various milling parameters.Dynamic light stering and powder Xray diffraction were used to determine the achieved particle and grain sizes

## Ball mill
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics,and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.Ball Milling Induced SHS&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Fig.1 shows the temperature of the milling container recorded during a typical MSR milling of a mixture of Zn and Se powders in a SPEX 8000 Mixer Mill [].During the initial activation period,the temperature of the mill increases gradually because of the mechanical energy dissipated in the mill,while mixing and activation take place,but little chemical transformation occurs.
