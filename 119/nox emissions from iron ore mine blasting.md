## Corex Process Wikipedia
Unlike the Blast furnace the Corex process does not use a hot blast of nitrogen,thereby greatly reducing NOx gas emissions,but instead uses oxygen In addition,the Corex process can use iron oxides containing up to 80% lump ore and uses non coking coal directly as a reducing agentBLAST MANAGEMENT PLAN 2012 2015 Vale2013322&ensp&#0183&enspThe Integra Mine Complex Project Approval (08 0101 and 08 0102),dated 26 November 2010,Condition No.19 of Schedule 3 requires preparation of a blast management plan.All of the requirements for the Plan are addressed in this document,as detailed in Appendix A.Project

## How steel industry mitigates easily pollutant emissions,
Iron ore sintering is the first operation in iron and steel production Its main purpose is to prepare the ore by mixing it with coal and other components before it’s melted in the blast furnace This step is essential to obtain a good yield in the blast furnace,minimize energy consumption and reduce waste Multiple acid gas emissionsAssessment Of Fugitive Particulate Emission Factors For,Emissions from Iron Ore Mining,Beneficiation,and Pelletizing This project is to accomplish the follow ing: to determine the available data regarding atmos pheric emissions from the iron ore mining,beneficia tion,and palletizing industries; to perform limited sampling to help complete the emission data picture; and to make.
