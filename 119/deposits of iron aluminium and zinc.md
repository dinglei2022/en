## Uses of Aluminium,Iron,Copper and Zinc Detailed List,
Uses of Aluminium,Iron,Copper and Zinc Copper,zinc,and iron are d block elements with atomic numbers 29,30 and 26 respectively Aluminium is a p block element with atomic number 13 They are all metals and are fair to good conductors of electricity They have a wide spectrum of applications in industrial as well as domestic fields due to.ZINC PLATING3 Low stress deposits The process of zinc plating does not expose your metal parts to unnecessary stress which may,in turn,reduce the quality of the parts 4 Increased strength A coating of zinc on your metal part makes it stronger and durable 5 Ductile capacity Zinc is a flexible metal,and as such,you can stretch it into thin and long.

## Corrosion Resistance of Zinc Plating Sharretts Plating
If you're contemplating the best way to protect metal surfaces against the relentless forces of corrosion,a simple phrase to keep in mind is "think zinc." When a zinc coating is electroplated onto the surface of ferrous (ironcontaining) metals,it creates a formidable corrosionresistant barrier — while also providing a number of other important benefits.Materials: Metals and Non Metals Class 8 Extra Questions,Oct 11,2019&#0183;&#32;Find out the locations of the deposits of iron,aluminium and zinc in India Mark these in an outline map of India In which form are the deposits found?
