Indium: There is little definitive information on the toxicity of elemental indium.Exposure to indium metal in solid form is expected to have few adverse health effects as long as no dust or fume is produced.In laboratory animals,indiumtin oxide was found to increase cancer risks through inhalation.Indium Element information,properties and usesAnother important use of indium is in making alloys used in electronic devices and dental materials.Indium has been called a &quotmetal vitamin&quot in alloys,which means that very small amounts of indium can make big changes in an alloy.For instance,the addition of small amounts of indium to gold and platinum alloys makes them much harder.
