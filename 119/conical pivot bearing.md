Abstract: Conical pivot bearing analysis and minimal torque design criteria for aerospace applications Publication Date: Jan 01,1966FUNdaMENTALS of Design28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;• Bearing is defined by Webster’s to be “a support or supporting part” A bearing is a component that allows for relative motion between parts • Your skeleton is the central structure that supports your body • Your body’s joints are bearings that allow different parts to move • Bearings can have many forms,but only two types.
