## Derating of Tantalum Capacitor FAQs Engineering and
2018313&ensp&#0183&enspWhen selecting a suitable Tantalum Capacitor for your appliion,its rated voltage and temperature are one of important factors to consider.For optimal performance and long term reliability,derating is often considered.Kemet's T491 series of tantalum surface mount capacitors is an example to show the derating guideline table.Technical &#187 Derate tantalum capacitors by how much? AskLet's demystify the confusing topic of voltage derating (for Tantalum or Polymer capacitors.)Capacitors with a tantalum pentoxide dielectric offer pack a lot of capacitance into a tiny package while at the same providing a very low ESR.

Derating is a term that is frequently used but not always in the right context or for the right reasons.Oftentimes one or more parameter of a device is derated to improve some type of performance.Said performance metric could be quiescent current or it could be life.In the case of tantalum capacitors voltage is derated in an effort to improve the life of the capacitor.

## The Ups and Downs of Tantalum Capacitors Arrow
The previous characteristics show how tantalum capacitors can be uniquely suited to help in modern electronics,but they are not without their quirks and there are a couple of major ones to take into account when you want to design these in.Tantalum capacitors are generally polarized devices,meaning that during layout and assembly you need to pay more attention to their orientation.Are tantalum capacitors safe for use in new designs2019718&ensp&#0183&enspWikipedia tantalum capacitors.Most tantalum capacitors are polarized devices,with distinctly marked positive and negative terminals.When subjected to reversed polarity (even briefly),the capacitor depolarizes and the dielectric oxide layer breaks down,which can cause it to fail even when later operated with correct polarity.
