## Iron ore pelletizing systems Metso
Iron ore pelletizing systems.Iron ore fines are agglomerated into pellets and then indurated using a furnace to create iron ore pellets.These are typically fed to a blast furnace or DRI plant as part of the process to make steel.Review of Organic Binders for Iron Ore AgglomerationMay 22,2013 example,with bentonite,it is well known that using a western,or Wyoming,bentonite with high sodium to.makeup of binders added during agglomeration can greatly affect the composition of iron ore.One U.S.A.iron ore pellet plant has used a modified cornstarch based binder to reduce bentonite.
