## Fracture of metal plates on normal impact by a rigid
Punching through aluminum plates on normal impact by a rigid conical body is considered.Plates of D16AT and AMTsM were used.The ballistic limit is determined depending on the plate thickness,its material,and the cone angle of the punching body.The fracture mechanisms are determined for various combinations of these parameters.
