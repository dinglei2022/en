## Sodium Nitrate Formula Sodium Nitrate Uses,Properties,
Sodium nitrate is an important inorganic salt,which is used as a food additive among many other applications Occurrence: Sodium nitrate occurs naturally as large mineral deposits (called nitratine) in dry regions,especially in the deserts of South America,so it is also called as Chile Peru.IXX Effects of High Magnetic Field on Chemical and2014618&ensp&#0183&enspEffects of a high magnetic field gradient (8 T,ca.400 T2 m,horizontal) on the behavior of E.coliwere examined.An E.coli suspended solution was injected in one end of a glass tube (5 mmφ&#215 150 mm) ﬁlled with viscous medium containing sodium nitrate.They move along the tube axis because of chemotaxis to nitrate ion.
