## New to TIG and need some help selecting filler rod
Now I need to get some filler rod,tungsten,and whatever else I might need to learn how to TIG steel and aluminum.I don't mind spending a couple extra bucks on good filler rod and tungsten so what should I start out with.I was looking at arczone and there are way too many choices! What size,type,and brand filler rod should I buy?POSTALLOY&#174 Tungsten Carbide Hardfacing ProductsPOSTALLOY&#174 299SPL is an openarc hardfacing overlay that utilizes a specially formulated tungsten carbide to produce a &quothighly feathered&quot microstructure that is unusually hard and more abrasion resistant than standard tungsten carbide hardfacing wires.
