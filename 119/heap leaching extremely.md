## Bioleaching Wikipedia
Bioleaching is the extraction of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms.This is much cleaner than the traditional heap leaching using cyanide.Bioleaching is one of several appliions within biohydrometallurgy and several methods are used to recover copper,zinc,lead,arsenic,antimony,nickel,molybdenum,gold,silver,and cobaltGold Cyanidation Ground Truth TrekkingCyanide &quotheap leaching&quot is used for very lowquality ore,or sometimes to reprocess waste material from other extraction methods (e.g.leftover mine &quottailings&quot).A large outdoors mound of ore is sprayed with a cyanide solution that drips through the rock over time.

## Cyanide Leaching Mining SGS
Heap Leaching.Heap leaching facilitates the profitable extraction of gold from very low grade ore.Prior to heap leaching,either run of mine (ROM) or crushed ore is heaped into structures 10 to 20m high that are stacked on an impermeable layer.A dilute cyanide solution is sprayed on the heap,percolates through the pile and dissolves theWhat is Heap Leaching? (with picture)20191022&ensp&#0183&enspHeap leaching is an industrial process for extracting precious metals and minerals by dissolving them from ore with liquids known as leaching solutions.The process is commonly used to extract metals such as gold,copper,and uranium yellowcake in addition to several other minerals.Heap leaching is usually carried out in the open and on slightly sloping ground covered with a watertight
