The mass and energy balances for the cement plant concepts with carbon capture were used furthermore to evaluate the key plant performanc The designs were optimized by performing a heat integration analysis (using pinch technique) for maximization of the overall energy efficiency (Smith,2005)As an illustrative example,Figure 1 presents the hot and cold composite curves,Optimization of Particle Sizes in High Volume Fly Ash.
