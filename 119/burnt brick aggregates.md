## Utilization of crushed clay brick in concrete industry.
Utilization of crushed clay brick in concrete industry.The brick wastes were crushed,sorted and classified into coarse and fine aggregates as well as powder (CBP).Recycled brick aggregates were incorporated as alternative aggregate for fine and or coarse aggregates.The used replacement percentages were 0,25,50,75 and 100 by volume.Effect of Water Cement Ratio on the Compressive Strength.The research was conducted to study the effect of water cement ratio on the compressive strength of gravel crushed over burnt bricks concrete.Trial mixes were prepared using the crushed over burnt bricks as coarse aggregates only
