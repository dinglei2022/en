## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores
The first steps of copper processing are the same for both ores: mining and transporting.Copper mining is usually performed using openpit mining,in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the earth over time.To remove the ore,boring machinery is used to drill holes into the hard rock,and explosives are insertedSmelting TerraFirmaCraft Wiki FANDOM powered by WikiaSmelting in TFC is the process of refining ore into metal It is a lot more complicated than in Minecraft,and this article will briefly cover the main points of smelting In the early game,players are restricted to smelting copper and copper alloys,such as bronze,using pit kilns Metal ore.
