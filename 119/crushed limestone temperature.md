## What happens when acid reacts with limestone? Questions
Jun 15,2008&nbsp&#0183&#32Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3).This is not very soluble,so rocks don't dissolve very quickly.But if you add an acid,you add hydrogen ions (H+),which will react with the carbonate to form hydrogen carbonate HCO3 ions,which are very soluble in water,and the limestone will dissolve.Or,if there is more acid,two hydrogen ions willSafety Data Sheet Limestone lehighhansonOther means of identifiion: Crushed Stone,Calcium Carbonate,Aggregate Relevant identified uses of the substance or mixture and uses advised against: Limestone may be used in the manufacture of bricks,mortar,cement,concrete,plasters,paving materials,and other construction materials.Limestone aggregate may be distributed in
