2005727&ensp&#0183&enspAbstract.Active contours are a popular method for automatic extraction of object boundaries based on image features in medical images.However,in short axis cardiac MR images,they fail to give correct results due to the presence of papillary muscles along the left ventricular endocardium boundary.Planes,Sequences,and Protocols Radiology Web SiteReturn to top.Short Axis for T2 FS,T2 Mapping,T1 Mapping,Perfusion.Align the 5 slices on the 4 Chamber view and adjust the slice gap so that the first slice is in the plane of the mitral valve and the last slice is at the apex.

## Improved estimation of the cardiac global SpringerLink
Estimating the left ventricular (LV) volumes at the different cardiac phases is necessary for evaluating the cardiac global function.In cardiac magnetic resonance imaging,accurate estimation of the LV volumes requires the processing a relatively large number of parallel shortaxis crosssectional images of the LV (typically from 9 to 12).Automated motion artifacts removal between cardiac longCarminati,MC,Maffessanti,F &amp Caiani,EG 2012,Automated motion artifacts removal between cardiac long and shortaxis magnetic resonance images.in Computing in Cardiology.vol.39,6420487,pp.689692,39th Computing in Cardiology Conference,CinC 2012,Krakow,Poland,9 9 12.

## Imaging longitudinal cardiac strain on shortaxis images
2019718&ensp&#0183&enspThis article presents a new method for measuring longitudinal strain in a shortaxis section of the heart using harmonic phase magnetic resonance imaging (HARPMRI).The heart is tagged using 11 SPAMM at enddiastole with tag surfaces parallel to a shortaxis imaging plane.Two or more images are acquired such that the images have different phase encodings in a direction orthogonal to theReformatted FourChamber and ShortAxis Views of theShortaxis view at the base of the heart.Scrolling the images in this plane will give the shortaxis stack to be used to calculate left ventricular volumes.The left hand image shows the orientation of the cross hairs at the end of step 3,namely after the creation of the short axis stack.

## Combining shortaxis and longaxis cardiac MR images by
In cardiac MR images the slice thickness is normally greater than the pixel size within the slices.In general,better segmentation and analysis results can be expected for isotropic highresolution (HR) data sets.If two orthogonal data sets,e.g.shortaxis (SA) and longaxis (LA) volumes are combined,an increase in resolution can be obtained.
