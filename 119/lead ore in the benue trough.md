Abstract The Benue trough is an intra continental rift initiated in the Cretaceous during the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean.Lead zinc barite fluorite mineralization occurs along the 600 km axis of the trough in three discrete sub basins which coincide with the lower,middle and upper mineral districts of the Benue …A review of the geology of the Benue Trough,Nigeria.LEAD ZINC MINERALISATION OF THE BENUE TROUGH One of the major features of the Benue Trough is the central zone of lead zinc mineralisation which is about 80 km wide and extends from Abakaliki in the south to Zurak in the northeast,a distance of about 560 km (Fig.1).The mineralisation tends to be restricted to strata of Albian to Cenomanian age.

Mining activities have long been recognized as a major source of environmental contamination associated with heavy metals and metalloids.This study evaluated the relationship between the occurrence and mining of lead zinc sulphide ores at Ishiagu,Nigeria,and heavy metal and metalloid contamination.A comparative study of two zones in the area,with and without mining.
