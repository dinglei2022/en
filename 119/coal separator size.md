The size of the separator is then calculated by considering the path of a droplet entering at the bottom of one end of the separator and exiting from the other end of the separator (Figure 1).Figure 1: Illustration showing the relationship between inflow rates,minimum required area of a separatorCoal breaker WikipediaCoal breakers also remove impurities from the coal (typically slate) and deposit them into a culm dump.The coal breaker is a forerunner of the modern coal preparation plant.Generally speaking,a coal tipple was typically used at a bituminous coal mine,where removing impurities was important but sorting by size was only a secondary,minor
