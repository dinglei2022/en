## What are the advantages of open cast mining? Quora
Open cast mining has several advantages compared to underground mining,these are: * Open cast allows for high tonnages to be moved hence economies scale * Safe as workers are not working under disturbed roof * Open cast trucks have higher payloa.Nuclear Fuel Cycle Department of EnergyUranium Mining Both “conventional” open pit,underground mining,and in situ techniques are used to recover uranium ore In general,open pit mining is used where deposits are close to the surface and underground mining is used for deeper deposits Open pit mining involves a large pit where stripping out and removal of much overburden.
