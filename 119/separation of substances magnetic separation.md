## What is magnetic separation and where is it used in,
Magnetic separation is used in many fields and industri The main use in manufacturing is using the magnetic properties of a substance to separate magnetic materials from nonmagnetic materials.Separation of enantiomers by their enantiospecific,Jun 22,2018&#0183;&#32;Thus,one enantiomer adsorbs preferentially when the magnetic dipole is pointing up,whereas the other adsorbs faster for the opposite alignment of the magnetization The interaction is not controlled by the magnetic field per se,but rather by the electron spin orientations,and opens prospects for a distinct approach to enantiomeric separations
