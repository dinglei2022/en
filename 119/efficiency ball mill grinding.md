## High efficiency cement grinding
This is called a combi grinding circuit.The main feature of such a system is the pre grinding of cement clinker in the POLYCOM and a final grinding in the ball mill.The specific power consumption compared to a ball mill cement grinding is significantly lower and additionally paired with a 30 to 40 per cent increase in output.Comparison of energy efficiency between ball mills and stirred mills.At product sizes finer than 80% passing 75 μm,the efficiency of ball mill grinding rapidly decreases.The practical limit to ball mill product fineness is considered.

## Optimization of mill performance by using
media in the mill by looking at the mill grinding efficiency.At that time,it was difficult to acquire a lot of valuable information as robustness in an aggressive environment was not assured.Twenty years later,the Sensomag is able to show this interaction by looking on the pulp position angle and media angle.Factors Affecting Ball Mill Grinding EfficiencyThe following are factors that have been investigated and applied in conventional ball milling in order to maximize grinding efficiency: a) Mill Geometry and Speed Bond (1954) observed grinding efficiency to be a function of ball mill diameter,and established empirical relationships for recommended media size and mill speed that take this factor into account.
