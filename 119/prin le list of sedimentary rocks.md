## ROCKS AND THEIR USES coaleduion
Rocks normally consist of several minerals,some essential,some accessory.A rock may be thought of as a &quotmineral environment.&quot Each rock type was formed under certain specific conditions,resulting in the formation of a fairly predictable group of minerals.Rocks fall into three classes according to their origin: Igneous SedimentaryRock Types sandatlasChert is a hard and compact sedimentary rock,consisting dominantly of very small quartz crystals.Chert occurs mostly in carbonate sedimentary rocks as nodules or layers.Flint is a darkcolored variety of chert.^ Coal is a combustible rock containing more than 50% by weight of carbonaceous material.Coal in most cases is a lithified peat.
