## Ground Calcium Carbonate Mississippi Lime
The Mississippi Lime Feed Grade Limestone is mined from the high purity formation in Ste Genevieve,Missouri which consists of limestone with an average calcium carbonate content of 985% Feed Grade Limestone is a granular material used in mineral feeds and poultry grits because of its high calcium content and consistent particle sizeTHE EFFECT OF CALCIUM CARBONATE PARTICLE SIZE AND,The Effect of Calcium Carbonate Particle Size and Solubility on the Utilization of Phosphorus from Phytase for Broilers MK Manangi and CN Coon1 Department of Poultry Science,University of Arkansas,Fayetteville,AR 72701,USA Abstract: A twenty eight day floor pen experiment was carried out using 1680 Cobb 500 male day old chicks

## Pulverized Limestone Fillers Piqua Materials
All Piqua Materials Fillers are produced from a high calcium limestone that is quarried from the Brassfield geological formation one of the whitest and most consistent formations in Ohio.The current grades of pulverized lime range from an average particle size of 53 micron down to an average particle size of 3 micron.Particle Size and Standard Deviation PRWebmean particle size (in microns or &#181;) is commonly referred to as the “average” or the “micron size” Another common calculation performed in the size analysis procedure is to determine the “log normal standard deviation” For most feed materials ground through a roller mill,the log normal
