## Rod mills,how they function
Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and broken and worn rods must be removed.1911 80% Tactical Machining Build,Part 6: Barrel Seating.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;I searched everywhere to find a reduced shank 18mm Bit,and the most all of them had to offer me was an 18mm Ball nose end mill on a 16mm shank.I think one of the possible prospects would be to take the 18mm ball nose end mill to a machine shop and have them machine the shank so that a standard drill press could accept it.
