Electroplating is the process of using electrodeposition to coat an object in a layer of metal(s) Engineers use controlled electrolysis to transfer the desired metal coating from an anode (a part containing the metal that will be used as the plating) to a cathode (the part to be plated)High Performance Gold Plating For Microdevices20171017&ensp&#0183&enspthe knowledge to manage a flexible control of the plating process.Analogous methods have been recently described for electroless nickel 13 .In this paper,the aspects of high performance gold plating will be demonstrated and discussed exemplarily for the bump plating process.Gold Plating
