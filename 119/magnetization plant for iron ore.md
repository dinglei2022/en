## Iron Ore in 1997 USGS Mineral Resources Program
The dock and steel plant data were compiled jointly by AIOA and the.American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI).Although iron ore was produced by 14 companies,9 of them accounted for 99.5% of all domestic production.The 14 companies operated 14 mining operations,10 concentration plants,and 10 pelletizing plants.STEINERT Global Australia Wet Drum Magnetic Separators.In iron ore processing,the WDS separates magnetic iron ore such as magnetite from waste rock at P80&#39;s commonly down to 28μm.As operational issues make it extremely difficult for plant operators to maintain all the above optimally for all conditions,STEINERT has embarked on the development of a more user friendly&nbsp;.
