## Sphalerite: Mineral information,data and localities.
Sphalerite Group.Sphalerite,also known as blende or zinc blende,is the major ore of zinc.When pure (with little or no iron) it forms clear crystals with colours ranging from pale yellow (known as Cleiophane) to orange and red shades (known as Ruby Blende),but as iron content increases it forms dark,opaque metallic crystals (known as Marmatite).Sulfide Minerals thoughtcoMay 25,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32Sphalerite can be found in many ore veins of sulfide minerals,commonly associated with galena and pyrite.Miners call sphalerite &quotjack,&quot &quotblackjack,&quot or &quotzinc blende.&quot Its impurities of gallium,indium and cadmium make sphalerite a major ore of those metals.
