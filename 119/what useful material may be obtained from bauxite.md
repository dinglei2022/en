## The Environmental Impact of Aluminum (And Why it's Still
Mining may be rough,but there is a silver lining (pun intended)! Almost 75% of all the aluminum ever produced in the US is still in use today.That's how well aluminum can be and is recycled! Aluminum is not only a great material because it's lightweight and conducts heat well,it can also be recycled indefinitely (if uncontaminated).ORIGIN OF BAUXITE Library WURORIGIN OF BAUXITE Selected papers reprinted from Geonotes and although the quantum of bauxite thus formed may be relative&#173 insoluble residue removed in this manner could be obtained.This omission indies that the thickness of limestone necessary to yield the suggested residue is an underestimate by a factor that is indeterminable.65.
