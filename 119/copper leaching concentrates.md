## COPPER Copper production svn.eeni.tbm.tudelft
Copper production About 80 % of primary copper production comes from lowgrade or poor sulfide ores.After enrichment steps,the copper concentrates are usually treated by pyrometallurgical methods.Generally,copper extraction follows the sequence (see Figure below): 1.Beneficiation by froth flotation of ore to give copper concentrateCopper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper OresCopper processing is a complied process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called hodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different

## LEACHING OF LOWGRADE COPPER ORES: A CASE STUDY
The leaching experiments were performed using sulphuric acid solutions,whereby the kinetics of copper leaching was investigated with respect to acid concentration and solid to liquid ratio.The copper concentration in the leach solution ranged from 0.80 to 1.75 g dm3.The total Cu recovery rate ranged from 30 to 56 %,whereas theCopper Mining and Extraction: Sulfide OresAfter this stage the enriched ore now contains about 25% copper by mass and is called copper concentrate.It is valuable enough to ship to other plants and other countries for processing.For example China,Germany and Japan are major copper producers that use concentrate from around the world.
