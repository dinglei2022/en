## HOW CYCLONES WORK Heumann Environmental
A common,but inaccurate,description of how a highefficiency cyclone works often goes,"the particles are thrown towards the wall of the highefficiency cyclone where they are slowed by friction and then fall into the receiver due to gravity." This statement is almost completely wrong.Experimental and CFD study on the effects of surfaceMar 20,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Based on the boundary layer separation theory reported by Kim et al.we divided the cyclone into two regions: the turbulentcore region and the nearwall region (or "boundary layer region").Li et al.[36] reported several effects of boundary layer thickness on the separation efficiency in a cyclone separator per an elementary numerical

The cleaned ﬂuid leaves the cyclone through the vortex ﬁnder.However,it might happen that particles stick at the wall instead of being collected in the dustbin.In this case deposits at the wall are built up.This has a negative eﬀect on the performance of the cyclone [12].
