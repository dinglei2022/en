## Arsenic and Drinking Water from Private Wells Wells
Once released,arsenic remains in the environment for a long time.Arsenic is removed from the air by rain,snow,and gradual settling.Once on the ground or in surface water,arsenic can slowly enter ground water.High arsenic levels in private wells may come from certain arsenic containing fertilizers used in the past or industrial waste.Arsenic niehs.nih.govJul 01,2014&nbsp&#0183&#32Arsenic levels tend to be higher in drinking water that comes from ground sources,such as wells,than from water from surface sources,such as lakes or reservoirs.For additional details on arsenic and water,including testing,level,measurement,and removal information,please see the NIEHS Fact Sheet on Arsenic (676KB).
