## Liquid liquid extraction Wikipedia
Liquid liquid extraction (LLE),also known as solvent extraction and partitioning,is a method to separate compounds or metal complexes,based on their relative solubilities in two different immiscible liquids,usually water (polar) and an organic solvent (non polar) There is a net transfer of one or more species from one liquid into another liquid phase,generally from aqueous to organicSynergistic separation of Cu(II) and Zn(II) from aqueous,The process of separation of metal ion from aqueous solution is liquid liquid extraction The result showed that the synergistic by two extractants are low in percent extraction compared to single extractant The ratio of D2EHPA and TBP at 1:2 showed the extraction of Zn (II) is the highest than other ratio but vice versa for Cu (II)
