## Liebig Condenser With Integrated Stand: 8 Steps
Here is a few photos of the Liebig condenser in action As you can see,it is a small set up and I can only distil about 5 litres of wash at a time In the video you can see the drip rate or in this case flow rate of 65% ethanol being distilled to about 82% strength In the last picture you can see the strength of,How to improve condenser performance? : firewaterHow to improve condenser performance? (selffirewater),First off,I hope you have it set up counter flow Cold feed should come in at the drip side,and the return should be at the vapor feed,The best liebig condensor,IMO,would use thin rectangular tubing to maximize surface area You should simply try precooling the water with ice.

## Condenser (laboratory) Wikipedia
A condenser is an apparatus or item of equipment used to condense (change the physical state of a substance from its gaseous to its liquid state) In the laboratory,condensers are generally used in procedures involving organic liquids brought into the gaseous state through heating,with or without lowering the pressure (applying vacuum)—though applications in inorganic and other chemistry.Fractional distillation WikipediaFractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component parts,or fractions.Chemical compounds are separated by heating them to a temperature at which one or more fractions of the mixture will vaporize.It uses distillation to fractionate.Generally the component parts have boiling points that differ by less than 25 &#176C (77 &#176F) from each other under a pressure of one atmosphere.
