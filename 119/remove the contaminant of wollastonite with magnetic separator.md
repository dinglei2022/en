Wollastonite is a calcium inosilicate mineral (Ca Si O 3) that may contain small amounts of iron,magnesium,and manganese substituting for calcium.It is usually white.It forms when impure limestone or dolomite is subjected to high temperature and pressure,which sometimes occurs in the presence of silica bearing fluids as in skarns or in contact with metamorphic rocks.Metal recovery from incineration bottom ash: StateoftheThe Fe upgrading step typically consist of cleaning (e.g.by crushing) the Fe (in IBA from which extraneous material such as slag and rust has already been separated),handsorting the more valuable items (e.g.Fe and Cu parts),and passing the cleaned material through a magnetic separator (or a series of magnetic separators) to concentrate the
