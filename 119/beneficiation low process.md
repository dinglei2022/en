## Low rank coal beneficiation World Coal Preparation Trends
Low rank coal beneficiation is subdivided between (1) ash and pyritic sulfur specific gravity beneficiation,and (2) inherent moisture reduction.With the exception of some Bituminous "C" coals in Illinois (and Alberta) there is no commercial scale specific gravity beneficiation of low rank coals in North America.There is some pilot scaleHeap Leaching: A Growing Technology in BeneficiationLargely due to the economic advantages it can offer,heap leaching has prevailed as the preferred approach to beneficiation in settings where the ore source is low grade,or has been considered uneconomic to process via other approaches.
