## Zinc: smelting,producing and classifiionMetalpedia
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.The most common zinc concentrate processed is zinc sulfide,which is obtained by concentrating sphalerite using the froth flotation method.There are two methods of smelting zinc: the pyrometallurgical process and the hydrometallurgical process (over 90% of hydrometallurgical process is inFeatures of Shaimerden Deposit Oxidized Zinc Ore LeachingThe object studied is Shaimerden oxidized zinc ore deposit containing zinc,lead,copper,iron,calcium,magnesium,aluminum,manganese and silicon.Chemical and mineralogical composition of the ore are investigated.It is established that ore coarse fraction contains more zinc carbonate and less zinc silie compared with undersize particles.
