Why Using Flue Gas? Flue gases from fossil fuelbased electricitygenerating units are the major concentrated CO 2 sources in the US.If CO 2 is to be separated,as much as 100 megawatts of a typical 500megawatt coalfired power plant would be necessary for today's CO 2 capture processes based on the alkanolamines [4 6].Modeling and Control of Coal Mill ScienceDirectCONTROL OF COAL MILL In general the control systems,of mills have two components: coal air mixture temperature control and the coal feeder control.Control scheme for outlet temperature is essential since improper control may lead to chances of explosion.In the thermal power plant,the outlet temperature is maintained at 70 C.

## Boiler Performance and Mill Outlet Temperature
The mill outlet temperature has a major impact on the boiler performance levels.The mill outlet temperature directly impacts the dry gas loss in boiler which is a major loss.This depends on the moisture level in coal,the higher the moisture level the quantity of hot air required in mill for the same mill load is higher.
