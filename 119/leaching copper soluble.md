## Influence of copper minerals on cyanide leaching of …
In elucidating the influence of copper minerals on cyanide leaching of gold,copper minerals were classified into two types according to their solubility in cyanide solutions by proposing two concepts,cyaniding easily soluble copper (E Cu) and cyaniding insoluble copper.The former involves copper occurrence in metal,oxides and secondary.Application of SART to Heap Leaching of Gold Copper16&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;for every kg of cyanide soluble copper extracted.Therefore,if the ore has 40 g t of cyanide soluble copper,then the minimum quantity of cyanide required for copper leaching is 0.1 kg NaCN t.If the quantity of copper extracted increases to 300 g t then the cyanide requirement increases to 0.7 kg NaCN t.Viewed another way,since the 3 moles

2019731&ensp&#0183&enspBioleaching is the extraction of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms.This is much cleaner than the traditional heap leaching using cyanide.Bioleaching is one of several appliions within biohydrometallurgy and several methods are used to recover copper,zinc,lead,arsenic,antimony,nickel,molybdenum,gold,silver,and cobalt(PDF) LEACHING OF A ROASTED COPPER SULFIDE ORELEACHING OF A ROASTED COPPER SULFIDE ORE Rosselle Kim P.Castillano,Wilfredo T.Gatdula Jr.Gin Derick L.Magno,Jhunalyn H.Parantar METE 157N: HYDROMETALLURGY LABORTORY ABSTRACT Sulphide ores of copper are insoluble in dilute sulphuric acid leaching solutions,but a very high extraction can be obtained if the copper ore is in the oxidized condition.
