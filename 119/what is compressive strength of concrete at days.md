&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Important notes: As per IS,at least three cubes are tested at 7 days,14 days,28 days and the average of the three cubes are rounded to nearest 0.5N mm 2.Do not consider the specimen which differs more than 10% of the average value of compressive strength.American Shotcrete Association’s Pool and,Specifying a lower compressive strength would result in increased porosity of the in&#173;place shotcrete and thus greatly reduce the pool shell’s basic ability to hold water
