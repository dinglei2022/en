## Greenhouse Rocket Stove (rocket mass heater forum at permies)
Hello! We are in Tennessee.I wasn't sure where to post this.I am planning a project this year and really need some advice.We are building a 16'x16' greenhouse to raise tilapia and some other typical food items.In order to heat this greenhouse I want to use a rocket stove.I have a 55gallon metal drum I wanted to run the exhaust pipe through and then fill with sand.Why is preheat used when arc welding steel,and how is it,The choice of method of applying preheat will depend on the material thickness,weldment size and the heating equipment available at the time of welding The methods can include furnace heating for small production assemblies or,for large structural components,arrays of torches,electrical strip heaters,induction heaters or radiation heaters
