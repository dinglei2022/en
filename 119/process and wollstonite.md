## Wollastonite an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Wollastonite is a naturally occurring calcium metasilicate,composed of calcium oxide and silicon dioxide It is a white mineral that occurs in a needlelike form; aspect ratios range from 3 to 20 It has a high melting point,high pH (99),and a specific gravity of 29,and it exhibits low moisture absorptionWollastoniteBased Chemically Bonded Phosphate CeramicIn the first process,GNPs were oxidized in open air at 450˚C for 2 hours in a Barnstead Thermolyne 1400 furnace,using the method shown in Fig.8a.A homogeneous mixture of 100g of wollastonite powder and 1.0 wt% of GNPs was obtained in the RAM at 60Hz after 5 min of mixing.
