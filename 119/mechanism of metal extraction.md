Jul 23,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Isolation of elements in Chemistry class 12 aims to teach the students about various processes of extraction of metals from ores.Very few metals such as the noble metals,i.e.Gold,Silver,and Platinum etc.are present in their original metallic forms in nature.Bioextraction Mechanisms of Metals From Their OresThe presence of ferric oxide (Fe+3) is prerequisite for mineral degradation Both indigenous bacterial flora and or laboratory cultured bacteria have been used for extraction of various metals from their or In this article,the words mining,leaching and extraction have been used synonymously

## Kinetic Mechanism of Metal Extraction with Hydroxyoximes
The kinetic mechanism was elucidated for metal extraction with hydroxyoximes.The reaction of the 1:2 metal chelating agent complex formation determines the rate of copper extraction with the chelating agents,which are surface active and less soluble in the aqueous phase.
