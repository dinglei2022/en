## SMC's Switched Reluctance Motor is Changing the Game,
Switched reluctance motors (SRM) have been used for years in niche applications—such as inside nuclear reactor cores or mines—where reliability is key “SRMs are the most reliable electric motors because they eliminate most potential failure modes of motors such as magnets,overlapping coils that can short,and rotor currents,” Morris says
