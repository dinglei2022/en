May 24,2019&nbsp&#0183&#321.Introduction.Over the past decades,considerable efforts have been devoted to the preparation of tungsten carbide (WC) because of its platinumlike behavior [].WC is also known to be highly resistant to CO poisoning and own high physical and thermal stability which makes it a suitable promoter with platinum as electroalyst for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) [,].Metallographic Preparation of Plasma Sprayed TungstenThe basic process of metallographic preparation is cutting mosaic polishing polishing.Some scholars have proposed a metallographic preparation method of plasma sprayed tungsten carbide coating,which is to determine the process and process parameters of the metallographic preparation method of Plasma Sprayed Tungsten Carbide coating.

## Characteristics of tungsten carbide coating preparation
Characteristics of tungsten carbide coating preparation.1.The flame velocity is very high,usually five times the speed of sound.2.The speed of powder spraying is also very high,up to 2000 m s.3.The coating is highly compact and has high bonding strength.The porosity can be less than 1%,and the bonding strength can be greater than 70 Mpa.How to Braze Tungsten Carbide Surface PreparationTungsten carbide is made of tungsten powder,carbon powder (lamp black) and cobalt powder.This is the traditional formula.Modern carbide grades will have additives such as chrome to make the binder more corrosion resistant,grain growth inhibitors to make finer grains and other materials to make the carbide tougher or longer wearing.
