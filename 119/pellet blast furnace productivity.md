## Blast furnace productivity and the influencing parameters
Jun 23,2013&nbsp&#0183&#32Blast furnace productivity will improve by 1 % with the blast temerature increasing by 100 deg C.High top pressure also improves the productivity of the blast furnace.With every increase of top pressure of the blast furnace by 0.1 Kg Sq cm there is an improvement in the productivity of the blast furnace in the range of 0.5 % to 1.5 %.Pellet Degradation &amp Effect on Blast Furnace PerformanceA full survey of the laboratory and blastfurnace tests on 2 types of acid pellets is given.From the laboratory tests out in an atmosphere containing hydrogen,it appears that type B,produced out of 100% magnetitic ores,has a far better low temperature disintegration index and a lower reductibility index than type A,produced from a hematite magnetite mixture.
