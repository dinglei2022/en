## Zeolite Process for Water Softening and its Limitation Notes
Zeolite Process for Water Softening: Zeolite Process.Zeolite process for water softening has become a commercial success for the reason that zeolite can be easily regenerated.When Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ ions containing hard water is passes through a bed of sodium zeolite,the sodium ions are replace by the calcium and magnesium ions.Preparation and Activation of Sarulla Natural Zeolites asThen it was calcined to evaporate the trapped water in zeolite pores,burning the organic compounds contained in the zeolite and it induce the zeolite surface area increases,and to obtain a good form of crystallinity.Figure 1 shows the XRD pattern of Sarulla natural zeolite from the preparation process and the activation process.

## Utilization of natural zeolite in aerated concrete production
In the second part of the study,natural zeolite was also considered as both a gasgenerating agent and an aggregate in the concrete production.Zeolite samples were ﬁrst calcined for 2 h at 550 &quotC in a furnace to activate the zeolite surface according to previous study performed by Fu et al.1996 as an optimum condition [12].Cell Detoxifiion Upgrade: CytoDetox New ClinoptiloliteMay 30,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Using a patent pending process,the natural clinoptilolite zeolite in CytoDetox is stripped of the bound heavy metals,leaving cleaned and prepped cages ready for binding new heavy metals.This purified clinoptilolite zeolite can be used at higher concentrations making it much more effective.Because it has more cleaned cages,it is capable of

## (Solved) zeolite process.What are natural and synthetic
Natural Zeolite are non porous,eg.Natroite.Synthetic Zeolites Synthetic Zeolites are porous and possess gel structure.Sodium zeolites are generally used for softening of water and are simply represented as Na2Ze,where 'Ze' stands for insoluble zeolite.In the process,when hard water is passed through a bed of zeolite placed in anNatural zeolite and its appliion in concrete compositeNatural zeolites tend to be of low purity due to impurities such as minerals other than Si,Al,and quartz.Thus,natural zeolites are inappropriate for appliions requiring highly pure zeolite,such as petroleum refining and petrochemical production.Table 2 summarizes the chemical compositions of commonly used natural zeolites.
