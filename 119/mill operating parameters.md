## Effects of operating parameters on the efficiency of dry.
Operating parameters of the mill,such as rotor speed and feed rate are adjusted via frequency converter mounted on the control panel.In operation,the material is fed into the mill chamber via the feed hopper.Then,it is subjected to the grinding operation in grinding chamber.Finally,the product comes out from the product outlet.Ball mills: design and operating principleBall mills: design and operating principle.The Samara Strommashina plant has been manufacturing ball mills since the middle of the twentieth century.Hundreds of mills of most diverse modifications have
