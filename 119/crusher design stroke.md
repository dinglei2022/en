## Primary Crusher Selection &amp; Design
How you select your primary crusher will be based on factors like moisture content,maximum rock lump size,material density SG,abrasion index,degradability and it being prone to dusting or not.The crusher capacities given by manufacturers are typically in tons of 2,000 lbs.and are based on crushing limestone weighing loose about 2,700 lbs.per yard3 and having a specific …INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC &amp; …INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC &amp; TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH VOLUME 3,ISSUE 7,JULY 2014 ISSN 2277 8616 63 IJSTR&#169;2014 www.ijstr.org object optimization design for differential and grading toothed roll crusher using a genetic algorithm”,“Journal of China University of mining and technology”,Volume

## Metso MX™ Series cone crushers
Metso MX™ cone crusher’s cavity design,stroke direction and an effectively distributed crushing action lead to the ultimate rock on rock crushing motion.Together with multi action technology,this results in extended maintenance intervals,higher production and up to 25% longer liner lifetime.Cone Crusher DesignWhen the Symons brothers invented the cone crusher over 60 years ago,they employed the principle wherein the length of the crushing stroke was related to the free fall of material by gravity.This permitted the material being crushed to fall vertically in the crushing chamber; and in effect caused the particles to be crushed in a series of steps or stages as the particles got …

## Crusher
The Blake type jaw crusher has a fixed feed area and a variable discharge area.Blake crushers are of two types single toggle and double toggle jaw crushers.In the single toggle jaw crushers,the swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft which leads to a much more compact design than that of the double toggle jaw crusher.Stationary Crushing And Screening Equipment SandvikSandvik stationary crushers and screens productivity driven by technology.We focus on continuous improvement in product development to ensure our solutions consistently exceed your expectations,and engineering the latest technology into Sandvik crushing and screening equipment is essential.
