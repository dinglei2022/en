## How to Make Lightweight Concrete Blocks DoItYourself
Lightweight concrete blocks are made by adjusting the ratio of the concrete mix with a lightweight aggregate,like Perlite.With that in mind,the amount of aggregate substitution depends on the type of project.If you are using the concrete indoors or in a place unaffected by weather,then a full lightweight mix is acceptable.Construction Perlite InstitutePerlite is a versatile and sustainable mineral that is mined and processed with a negligible impact on the environment And the green community recognizes perlite enhanced products—like lightweight insulating concrete roof decks—as a high performance solution drawn from a natural material of nearly unlimited supply throughout the world
