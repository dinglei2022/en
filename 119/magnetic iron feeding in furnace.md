## Feasibility Study of Dephosphorization of Slag Generated
20171227&ensp&#0183&enspBasic oxygen furnace slag (BOF slag) is an unavoidable byproduct of steelmaking process of basic oxygen furnace.The main chemical constituents of BOF slag are CaO,FeO,Al 2 O 3,SiO 2 and MgO.Due to its high metallic value (FeO: 1620%) and lime content (CaO: 4550%),it is possible to use in iron making and steelmaking process to replace lime and recover iron and CaO.Iron Ore Magnetic Separation2019731&ensp&#0183&enspThis,I think,was the first use of magnetic ironore concentrates in a blast furnace.The small machine was of the belt type.Mr.Ball soon after designed a drumtype machine,and later a doubledrum machine in which a threepart separation was made.There are now magnetic machines of many types,but the majority use the alternating pole magnets.
