## A New Process For Sulfate Removal From Industrial Waters
A New Process For Sulfate Removal From Industrial Waters Many industrial wastewaters,particularly those associated with mining and mineral processing,contain high concentrations of sulfate.These concentrations typically exceed the secondary drinking water standard of 250 mg L and may be subject to discharge limits between 250 and 2000 mg L.Gypsum WikipediaGypsum is a soft sulfate mineral composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate,with the chemical.Gypsum may act as a source of sulfur for plant growth,which was discovered.Under reducing conditions,the sulfates it contains can be reduced back to sulfide by sulfate reducing.This process occurs via a three stage pathway:.
