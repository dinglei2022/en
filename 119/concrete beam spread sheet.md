## Slab on Metal Deck Analysis & Design Spreadsheet ,
The shear capacity of the composite deck alone is added to the beam shear capacity of the concrete to arrive at the total beam shear capacity of the slab 3 In the two form deck worksheets,the form deck is assumed to be "inverted" and not to contribute to the flexural moment capacity of the slabHome []Our aim is to enable all those involved in the design,use and performance of concrete and masonry to realise the potential of these materials.The Concrete Centre,part of the MPA.Mineral Products Association (MPA) is the trade association for aggregates,asphalt,cement,concrete,dimension stone,lime,mortar and silica sand industries.
