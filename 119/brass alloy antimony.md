What is a melting point? The melting point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes state from solid to liquid at atmospheric pressure at the melting point,the solid and liquid phases exist in equilibrium.A substance's melting point depends on pressure and is usually specified at standard pressure in reference materials.Dezincifiion of Brass 2 col v2 Copper0.1%.Antimony gave the best result alloys containing arsenic or phosphorus gave variable results.Nothing12 also observed the inhibiting effects of arsenic,antimony and phosphorus on dezincifiion,but in addition he noted that each of these elements aggravated the tendency of the brass to fail by

AlucoFlux SB Provides a protective cover during the melting of yellow brass and other alloys with a high zinc content to prevent zinc fuming and resultant zinc loss.It will also absorb and agglomerate nonmetallic impurities for easy removal by skimming.Also,it can be used on alloys of lead,tin and antimony.Galvanizing FluxesLead Free Alloys NEY Metals &amp AlloysTraditionally,these Tin alloys that contained Antimony and Copper were unforgiving.The difficulty was in the finishing.Lead and Cadmium would allow the alloys to cast without porosity.When Lead Free Pewter alloys,such as Britannia were used,the results were less than impressive.
