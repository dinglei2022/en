## What is the chemical equation for aqueous sodium chloride
Nov 08,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32This reaction is commonly used to illustrate basic solubility rules,and solubility equilibria.All nitrates are soluble,hence silver nitrate is soluble and all halides are soluble,EXCEPT for #AgX#,#PbX 2#,and #Hg 2X 2#.Thus silver nitrate is soluble,but silver chloride precipitates from solution as a curdy white solid.GCSE CHEMISTRY The Reaction between Sodium and ChlorineAtomic Structure.The Reaction between Sodium and Chlorine.Chlorine has 7 electrons in its outer shell.It is in group 7 of the periodic table.When an atom of chlorine reacts it will gain one electron from sodium.The outer shell of chlorine will then have 8 electrons and be full.The chloride ion will have an extra electron and therefore an extra negative charge (shown as a sign).
