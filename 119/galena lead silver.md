## Galena Mineral Information photos and Facts,sulfide Lead Ore
Galena,the most important ore of lead,occurs in great lead gray crystalline masses,in large and small crystals,in coarse and fine granular aggregates,and in other less common forms.It usually contains small quantities of the sulfides of silver,zinc,cadmium,copper and bismuth and in some cases native silver and gold.Early Metal Technology 2.Silver and LeadNevertheless,most of the silver produced in antiquity was from the little bit of silver sulfide or other silver compounds contained in the lead ores galena or cerrusite.The primary production of silver requires the smelting of these ores,producing a lead silver alloy,and then the separation of the silver from the lead and the rest.

Galena is by far the greatest ore of lead.The extraction process to remove the lead from the sulfur is very simple,thus lead has been extracted from Galena since the earliest times.Galena from certain regions is rich in silver,and some specimens may contain as much as 20 percent silver.Because of this,silver rich Galena is also an ore of silver.Another use of Galena was its importance.Evolution of Silver smelting Technology of Japan in the Middle of.Nihonshoki (the History of Japan) recorded that the first silver production in Japan was in 674 from Tsushima Island.There is argentiferous galena veins in Tsushima and ancient silver would have been derived by cupellation of this lead,which contained 0.2% Ag,though no archaeological study was done.In those days&nbsp;.
