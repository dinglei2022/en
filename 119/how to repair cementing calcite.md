## Preservation Brief 2: Repointing Mortar Joints in Historic.
Masonry cement is a preblended mortar mix commonly found at hardware and home repair stores.It is designed to produce mortars with a compressive strength of 750 psi or higher when mixed with sand and water at the job site.It may contain hydrated lime,but it always contains a large amount of portland cement,as well as ground limestone and.Calcite specific coupling protein in barnacle underwater.Calcite is the major constituent in both the shell of barnacle base and the periphery,which is also a possible target for the cement,due to the gregarious nature of the organisms.The specificity of the protein for calcite may be related to the fact that calcite is the most frequent material attached by the cement.
