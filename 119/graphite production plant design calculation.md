## Estimation of graphite dust production in ITER TBM using
The estimation of graphite dust production in a pebble bed has been studied in two methodologies.First,pebbles are modeled as rigid spheres and the interpebble dynamics is simulated using the Discrete Element Method (DEM).This scheme uses simple equations and the calculation time is much less than the other method.SYSTEM DESIGN PROCESS PLANT PIPING OVERVIEW OFPROCESS PLANT PIPING SYSTEM DESIGN By: Vincent A.Carucci Carmagen Engineering,Inc.2 Piping System • Steel Production Process.6 Stress Strain Diagram S A B C E.7 Corrosion Resistance and leaves graphite in place.Result is extremely soft material with no metal loss.9
