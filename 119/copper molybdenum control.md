## Molybdenum Supplements &amp Remedies Andrew Weil,M.D.
Although molybdenum does not have a known toxicity level in humans,taking high concentrations may have adverse effects on copper levels by interfering with its absorption.One study found that high levels of dietary molybdenum,up to 1,500 mcg,caused excessive excretion of copper.COPPER TOXICITY SYNDROMEHidden Copper Toxicity Indiors.The hair copper level is a very unreliable indior for copper toxicity.So is serum copper,serum ceruloplasmin,and many other tests because the copper can hide deep in the brain and the liver.A liver biopsy is a good indior,but is a

The processes of grinding and flotation of coppermolybdenum ores are characterised by significant fluctuations of all input,output and intermediate parameters.Instability and nonoptimal parameters of grinding and flotation cause between 3% to 6% losses of the valuable component.Is Molybdenum Lurking In Your Forages? Canadian CattlemenMay 14,2009&nbsp&#0183&#32The symptoms of molybdenum toxicity mimic those of copper deficiency in beef tle.This is because molybdenum ties up copper in the rumen interfering with its absorption into the bloodstream.In effect,this creates a copper deficiency (which can be fatal as well) even though the dietary intake of copper may be adequate.

Copper is not the only metal that occurs in porphyry deposits.There are also porphyry ore deposits mined primarily for molybdenum,many of which contain very little copper.Examples of porphyry molybdenum deposits are the Climax,Urad,and Henderson deposits in central Colorado,and the Questa deposit in northern New Mexico.Zangezur Copper Molybdenum CombineThe copper and molybdenum concentrates are dewatered in two separate plants.The quality control is ensured by the operations of upto date equipped laboratories dealing with ore samples and flotation analysis,as well as with various research test works.
