## Iron Processing FEECO International Inc.
Our heavy duty iron ore balling drums are relied on by some of the industry’s top producers to process iron ore fines into pellets for the steelmaking process.The use of a disc pelletizer is a popular alternative approach to pelletizing iron ore fines,as this offers more control over pellet size and produces a more refined pellet product.The case for wet processing iron ore HAVER AustraliaMany iron ore producers are facing challenging times; processing crude material with rising levels of impurities and a volatile iron ore price.Beneficiation,particularly washing (scrubbing),can be the key to upgrading the ore to earn more per shipped tonne.High end steel production at a low coke consumption level and a high productivity rate can only be achieved by using high quality.

## how do you make wet iron ore flow
How iron is made.The raw materials used to produce pig iron in a blast furnace are iron ore,coke,sinter,and limestone Iron ores are mainly iron oxides and include magnetite,hematite,limonite,and many other rocks The iron content of these ores ranges from 70% down to 20% or less.Safe carriage of Iron ore & other iron concentrates in bulkSafe carriage of Iron ore & other iron concentrates in bulk Iron ore is used for the production of metallic iron in steel making.Although some 45 countries export natural iron ore resources,seven countries provide 75% of the total exported.The two largest exporters are Brazil and Australia,with about 33% of total world exports each.
