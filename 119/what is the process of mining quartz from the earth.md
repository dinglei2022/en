## Quartz Wikipedia
Quartz is a hard,crystalline mineral composed of silica (silicon dioxide)The atoms are linked in a continuous framework of SiO 4 silicon oxygen tetrahedra,with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra,giving an overall chemical formula of SiO 2Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in Earth's continental crust,behind feldspar Quartz exists in two forms,the normal α quartz.9 Step Process for Discovering,Mining & Refining GoldIn modern times though,mining for gold is a much more intensive,yet sophisticated process Most surface,or alluvial gold has been found,which is why gold is mainly mined from the earth today Most surface,or alluvial gold has been found,which is why gold is mainly mined from the earth today

## Surface mining strip,open pit,mountaintop removal,
The mining takes place in those areas where the growth of vegetation is very minimal or at times does not exist due to the surface conditions The most important method used to extract the minerals from the earth is surface mining It is surprising to notice that 70 percent of the minerals extracted from the earth are through this processPlacer versus Quartz MiningThe process of lode [quartz] mining involves the labor of many miners working together to extract the gold from tunnels in a mountain or the earth”.

## Mineral Extraction The Environmental Literacy Council
Surface mining is undertaken when the minerals are located near the surface of the Earth As opposed to underground mining in which the overlying rock and soil are left primarily intact and tunnels are dug,surface mining involves removing the top soil,called the overburden,in order to recover the minerals,The mining process can also.University of Minnesota&#39;s Mineral Pages: QuartzQuartz was the mineral upon which the Stone Ages were based.it can be concentrated by weathering processes to be even more abundant in sedimentary.by some dinosaurs that swallowed stones to aid in the digestion of land plants.
