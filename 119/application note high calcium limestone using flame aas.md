## Silicon Si PubChem
Silicon is a trace element that resembles carbon and can form siliconcarbon as well as siliconoxygen,siliconhydrogen and siliconnitrogen bonds.The distribution of silicon in bodily tissues suggests that it may be important in cartilage and bone.Determination of trace magnesium and strontium in calciumThe current work presents the results of determination of trace magnesium (and strontium) in calcium carbonate based matrices,such as certified argillaceous limestone,using HPCIC.The HPCIC methodology developed is based on hydroxyethyliminodiacetic acid (HEIDA) bonded monolithic silica columns and optimised postcolumn reaction (PCR) detection.
