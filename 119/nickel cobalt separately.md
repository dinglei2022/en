## A New Process for Cobalt Nickel Separation teck
3.1 Basic Process for Cobalt Separation from Nickel CSIRO have developed a number of solvent extraction processes to separate nickel and cobalt (together) from other elements present in solution such as zinc and manganese.This technology uses a synergistic combination of two or more extractants,and is thus known as SSX.Cobalt and Nickel Cations as Corrosion Inhibitors forsurveyed included barium,cadmium,cobalt,lead,manganese,nickel,tin,and strontium.As a result of this survey,cobalt and nickel were selected for inten sive study.The experiments with cobalt and nickel will be described separately because of the slightly different

After producing the nickel matte,further processing is done via the Sherritt Gordon process.First,copper is removed by adding hydrogen sulfide,leaving a concentrate of only cobalt and nickel.Then,solvent extraction is used to separate the cobalt and nickel,with the final nickel concentration greater than 99%.ElectrorefiningAMS 2261G2006 Tolerances Nickel,Nickel2007123&ensp&#0183&enspseparately to width and thickness of rectangles.2.1 2.1.1 Cold Reduced: Nickel and NickelCopper Alloys: AMS 2261 AMS 2269 Tolerances,Nickel,Nickel Alloy,and Cobalt Alloy Bars,Rods,and Wire Chemical Check Analysis Limits,Nickel,Nickel

## High Pressure Acid Leach Caldera Engineering
High Pressure Acid Leach (HPAL) is a process used to extract nickel and cobalt from laterite ore bodies.The HPAL process utilizes elevated temperatures (roughly 255 degrees Celsius),elevated pressures (roughly 50 bar or 725 psi),and sulfuric acid to separate nickel and cobalt from the laterite ore.HPAL has been used since 1961 when it was.
