## What is the chemical formula for rust? Quora
The chemical equation for the formation of rust is: Iron + Water + Oxygen = Rust i.e.4 Fe(s) + 6 H2O(l) + 3 O2(g) → 4 Fe(OH)3(s) Then Fe(OH)3 dehydrates to produce Fe2O3.nH2O(s).Thereby,the chemical formula for rust is Fe2O3.nH2O.Corrosion Coupons caprocoCorrosion Coupons GENERAL Corrosion coupons are a simple yet effective tool for providing a quantitative estimation of corrosion rates occurring in an operating system.They also provide a visual indiion of the type of corrosion which may be occurring in the monitored system.THE CORROSION COUPON Ł Is a piece of metal of predetermined shape
