## Electronics Basics: What Is a Semiconductor? dummies
By carefully controlling the doping process and the dopants that are used,silicon crystals can transform into one of two distinct types of conductors: Ntype semiconductor: Created when the dopant is an element that has five electrons in its valence layer.Phosphorus is commonly used for this purpose.How Semiconductor is made nanotec museumThe manufacture of semiconductors is a highly interdisciplinary process involving physics,chemistry,electricity,electronics,metallurgy and more.Today,it has become so advanced that the purity of silicon used for semiconductors can be as high as 99.999999999% (eleven nines).

## CMP Applied Materials Semiconductor,Display and Solar
At one time,the CMP process was viewed as too dirty to use for the highlyprecise business of semiconductor manufacturing.CMP technology really took off in the mid1990s,when the industry was looking for ways to increase chip performance by replacing aluminum with speedier copper circuits.1.Semiconductor manufacturing process : Hitachi HighSemiconductor devices are completed through the frontend process (wafer processing operation) and the backend process (assembly process) described below.(In the following description of the element process,a very small area of a wafer surface is magnified and shown schematically.)
