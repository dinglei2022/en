## Summary of Fluorite Ore Flotation Process JXSC Machine
In general,the flotation process of the barite type fluoride ore is divided into two steps,one is combination flotation that obtains the combination of concentrate both of barite and fluorite,another is flotation that separation the barite and the fluorite from the combination concentrate.barite flotation recover icsangiovannibosconaro.itThe flotation results show that a barite concentrate assaying 98.21% BaSO 4 can be obtained with the recovery of 80.71%.The agent used in the flotation is water glass as depressant at 500 g t,sodium oleate as collector at 700 g t.
