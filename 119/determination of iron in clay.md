## Ecological Soil Screening Level for Iron Risk assessment
2018323&ensp&#0183&enspIron is essential for plant growth and is generally considered to be a micronutrient (Thompson and Troeh,1973).Iron is considered the key metal in energy transformations needed for syntheses and other life processes of the cells.Consequently,plants regulate iron uptake.Ferrous iron is more soluble and bioavailable to plants than ferric iron.determination of chemical formula of a smectite m.onalABSTRACT.Smectites are dominant clay minerals in bentonites.Each of.The converting a chemical analysis of a smectite mineral into a chemical formula was.and Fe”.All octahedral sites in trioctahedral (TO) structure ﬁlled with bivalent.
