## Can Coal Fly Ash Waste Be Put To Good Use? &#171 Breaking
A huge coal ash spill was discovered on February 2 at the Duke Energy power plant in North Carolina that has caused significant damage to the Dan River.The spill was caused when a storm drain pipe that runs underneath the 27acre containment pond sprung a leak and allowed 82,000 tons of ash mixed 27 million gallons to flow into the river.Fly ash WikipediaThe effect of fly ash on the environment can vary based on the thermal power plant where it is produced,as well as the proportion of fly ash to bottom ash in the waste product.This is due to the different chemical makeup of the coal based on the geology of the area the coal is found and the burning process of the coal in the power plant.
