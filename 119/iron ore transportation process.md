## Safe carriage of Iron ores &amp other iron concentrates in bulk
Safe carriage of Iron ore &amp other iron concentrates in bulk Iron ore is used for the production of metallic iron in steelmaking.Although some 45 countries export natural iron ore resources,seven countries provide 75% of the total exported.The two largest exporters are Brazil and Australia,with about 33% of total world exports each.How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? ReferenceIron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining.The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore however,because iron does not occur naturally,it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.

## Industrial Revolution Growth of Manufacturing
Iron making.The Industrial Revolution could not have developed without coal and iron.Coal was needed to make steam engines run and to produce iron.At the beginning of the 18 th century iron makers found a way to extract pure iron out of iron ore.They used coke,which was purer than coal and burned hotter,to melt the ore.As a result,the iron production increased and by the early 1800sKiruna Iron Ore Mine Mining Technology Mining News andWith an ore body 4km long,80m thick and reaching a depth of 2km,LKAB's Kiruna is the world's largest,most modern underground iron ore mine.Since mining began at the site over 100 years ago,LuossavaaraKiirunavaara AB (LKAB) has produced over 950Mt of ore,yet only one third of the original ore body has been extracted.

## Iron Ore Statistics and Information usgs.gov
Iron ore is a mineral substance which,when heated in the presence of a reductant,will yield metallic iron (Fe).It almost always consists of iron oxides,the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3).Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper OresCopper processing is a complied process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called hodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different
