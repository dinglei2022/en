Rotary shaft seals provide sealing and wiping functionality for rotating and swiveling movements under low pressure and high velocity.They perform two essential functions: the primary function is to retain the bearing or system lubricant in the system to avoid leakage,and the secondary function is to preclude any contamination of the system by external particles or other environmental impacts.Bucket Elevators PD EngineeringWe design and manufacture each Bucket Elevator individually to suit the material to be conveyed,the required throughput and the total lift height Shafts Removable shafts secured with locking elements are our standard,this allows damaged shafts to be replaced quickly at greatly reduced cost compared to welded in shafts where the entire Head or Tail pulley has to be replaced.

## Simple Bucket Elevator Shaft Dust Seal Design Quadruples …
You will need to make the seal housing that mounts to the bucket elevator,or to any low shaft velocity low pressure dust leak situation,from commercially available carbon steel.The secret behind its success is that the primary seals are in a separate housing to the bearing and provide multiple and redundant sealing before the dust can escape the bucket elevator.RUDDescription The bucket elevator casings are selfsupporting,but they require horizontal guides at least every 15 meters and below the elevator head.The bucket elevator head comprises a lower section with doors to access the adjustable discharge plate,and braced bearing mountings,for the pedestal bearings which support the drive shaft,the shaft exit points use grease filled radial shaft seals.
