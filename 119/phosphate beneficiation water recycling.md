## US Patent for Phosphate beneficiation process Patent
A process for the froth flotation separation of phosphate containing minerals by the use of a new collector agent is described.The new phosphate collector agent is prepared by mixing a fatty acid,tall oil pitch,an amine,and optionally sarcosine with fuel or furnace oil,and subsequently oxidizing the mixture by known methods.The new phosphate collector agent is added to the conditionedHow phosphate is mined and processedof phosphoric acid) as well as water.Many phosphate mines recycle their water,and in Florida,95% of water is reused.Beneficiation The fast movement of the slurry causes it to bang against the pipes,and this breaks apart any clay balls.What arrives at the beneficiation plant are finegrained sand,clay and phosphate sediments suspended in
