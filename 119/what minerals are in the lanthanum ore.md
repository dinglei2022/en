## Rare Earth Minerals Processing: ANZAPLAN
Rare Earth Minerals Processing There are two major REE ore minerals from which predominantly LREE can be extracted with relative ease: bastnaesite and monazite.Bastnaesite,a fluorocarbonate mineral and monazite,a phosphate,contain predominantly either cerium,lanthanum or yttrium.Gold Mineral Properties GeologyNative gold is an element and a mineral.It is highly prized by people because of its attractive color,its rarity,resistance to tarnish,and its many special properties some of which are unique to gold.No other element has more uses than gold.All of these factors help support a price of gold that is higher than all but a few other metals.

## Gold: The mineral native Gold information and pictures
Much of the gold mined is actually from gold ore rather then actual Gold specimens.The ore is often brown,ironstained rock or massive white Quartz,and usually contains only minute traces of gold.To extract the gold,the ore is crushed,then the gold is separated from the ore by various methods.Lanthanum investingLearn to invest in LanthanumLanthanumLanthanum fluoride is added to glass to produce fiberoptic glass because it produces a glass with superior transmission qualities in the infrared range.Because lanthanum absorbs infrared rays,it is also used in camera and telescope lenses to filter out the infrared spectrum.Lanthanum oxide also makes glass more resistant to alkalis.
