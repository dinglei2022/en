## What Is Energy Expenditure? Definition and Calculator
Energy expenditure is the amount of energy (or calories) that a person needs to carry out a physical function such as breathing,circulating blood,digesting food,or physical movement.Your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) is the total number of calories you burn each day.UpToDate2019426&ensp&#0183&enspBASAL METABOLISM.Basal metabolism is the energy expended for cellular and tissue processes that maintain life.It is measured under standard conditions of thermoneutrality,immobility,and fasting.The basal metabolic rate (BMR) relative to weight increases from birth to two years and then gradually declines through adolescence.
