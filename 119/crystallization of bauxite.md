## Crystal Habits and Forms of Minerals and Gems geology
Crystal habits are the external shapes displayed by individual mineral crystals or aggregates of crystals Crystal forms are solid crystalline objects bounded by flat faces that are related by symmetry,Mineral example: bauxite The specimen of bauxite in the photo is about six centimeters across and contains numerous pisolites that are.Mining and Refining Process World AluminiumThe bauxite residue sinks to the bottom of the settling tanks,then is transferred to the washing tanks,where it undergoes a series of washing stages to recover the caustic soda (which is reused in the digestion process),resulting in the formation of small crystals of aluminium trihydroxite (Al.
