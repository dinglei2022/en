## Mineral processing Wikipedia
Gravity separation is one of the oldest technique in mineral processing but has seen a decline in its use since the introduction of methods like flotation,classifiion,magnetic separation and leaching.Gravity separation dates back to at least 3000 BC when Egyptians used the technique for separation of gold.Magnetic separation WikipediaMagnetic Separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using magnets to attract magnetic materials.The process that is used for magnetic separation detaches nonmagnetic material with those who are magnetic.This technique is useful for not all,but few minerals such as ferromagnetic (materials strongly affected by magnetic fields) and paramagnetic (materials that are less

## How to choose a method for the separation of minerals
There are many methods of separation (concentration) of minerals: 1) Gravity separation.There are more than 12 types of gravity separation of minerals.It is used for the extraction of gold,coal,cassiterite,wolframite,rare earth mineral,niobium,zirconium,uranium minerals,and others.Read more.2) Magnetic separation.There are more than 14 types of magnetic separation of minerals.(PDF) Magnetic separation of weakly magnetic copper mineralsPDF High Gradient Magnetic Separation of chalcopyrite and bornite,both weakly magnetic copper minerals with mass susceptibilities of about 0.1 &#215 106m3 kg and 0.2 &#215 106m3 kg respectively

## Separating Minerals by Electromagnetic 911metallurgist
The earlier attempts at magnetic separation naturally were directed toward the separation of the most strongly magnetic substances.The first separators were employed in separating iron from brass filings and turnings,metallic iron from furnace products,and magnetite,the most strongly magnetic of minerals,from gangue.Magnetic Separation Mine Engineer.ComMagnetic separation is generally a low cost method of recovery,unless high intensity separators are required.The electromagnetic high intensity separators that produce 20,000 gauss,tend to be expensive.However,the rare earth magnetic separators are relatively inexpensive and can produce magnetic fields around 6,000 gauss.
