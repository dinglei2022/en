Mining is an inherently invasive process that can cause damage to a landscape in an area much larger than the mining site itself.The effects of this damage can continue years after a mine has shut down,including the addition to greenhouse gasses,death of flora and fauna,and erosion of land and habitat.Dangers of Copper Global Healing Center Health ProductsJun 04,2013&nbsp&#0183&#32Like most toxic metals,we can be exposed to copper in the air we breathe,water we drink,or food we eat.Copper can enter the body through the skin.If your home has copper plumbing pipes,there is a chance that your drinking water may include a high level of copper.

## Acid Mine Drainage groundtruthtrekking
Acid mine drainage (AMD) refers to the outflow of acidic water from a mining site.In most cases,this acid comes primarily from oxidation of iron sulfide (FeS2,also known as pyrite or &quotfool's gold&quot),which is often found in conjunction with valuable metals.Acid mine drainage is a major problem with many hardrock mines,including almost allErgonomic Assessment of Musculoskeletal Risk Factors atCenters for Disease Control and Prevention National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.Ergonomic Assessment of Musculoskeletal Risk Factors at Four Mine Sites: Underground Coal,Surface Copper,Surface Phosphate,and Underground Limestone
