2 are the ma&#237n processes in cement manufacturing:Clinkerization process: To transform the limestone into clinker (calcined limestone)Grinding process: Clinker is grinded and is blended with a small amount of gypsum to make finished cement.Other kinds of cement include Slag cement or pozzolan cement with GroundGranulated Blast Furnace SlagHow Cement Is MadeAlthough the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement,some kilns in the United States use a wet process.The two processes are essentially alike except in the wet process,the raw materials are ground with water before being fed into the kiln.

CO2 emission reductions will have a profound impact on the way we conduct our lives in the future.Cutting CO2 emissions from cement manufacture will drive the evolution of the production process for the coming decades,while combining the optimisation of the three traditional CO2 reduction levers with carbon capture technologies could drastically change the processes used in traditionalCement,lime and pozzolan DynamisDynamis' pozzolan production process,whether it involves color changing or not,undergoes drying by use of DFDryer and DHotGas.In a rotary kiln,the calcination is carried out in a controlled atmosphere.The key to this process is the use of DGasifier as the kiln's main burner.

One example is pozzolan cement,produced in some of our units in Brazil,and which uses pozzolan as a raw material.Highly resistant and durable,pozzolan is also sustainable: in addition to emitting 50% less COâ‚‚ than clinker in its production process,pozzolan requires 25% less energy,40% less water,generates 10% less waste,as well asPozzolans for Concrete and alternative cementsThe other meaning of &#179ASR&#178 is &#179alkalisilica reaction&#178.This one can be good or bad,and in reality always happens.The construction professional only refers to the unwanted form of ASR when he talks about it,but the desired reaction between pozzolan and the lime from the cementhardening process is also an &#179ASR&#178,though a much faster one.

## Portland cement Wikipedia
This became a specifiion for Portland cement.The next development in the manufacture of Portland cement was the introduction of the rotary kiln,patented by Frederick Ransome in 1885 (U.K.) and 1886 (U.S.) which allowed a stronger,more homogeneous mixture and a continuous manufacturing process.The advantages of lime pozzolan Features BuildingThe actual manufacturing process required to create lime pozzolan is also cited as a significant benefit.Lime is formed at a significantly lower temperature than Portland cement.This means that its production requires less fuel and energy than other conventional cement
