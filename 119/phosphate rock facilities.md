Phosphate Rock.The term phosphate rock (or phosphorite) is used to denote any rock with high phosphorus content.The largest and least expensive source of phosphorus is obtained by mining and concentrating phosphate rock from the numerous phosphate deposits of the world.Processing The Phosphate RiskIn Florida,after the phosphate rock is extracted,the ore is dumped into a pit at the mine site,and highpressure water guns turn it into slurry.The slurry is pumped to a beneficiation plant.At the processing plant,the slurry mixture goes through a twostep process to separate the phosphate rock

PHOSPHATE ROCK.By R.W.STONE.With the beginning of the war the facilities for shipping phosphate rock to Europe were greatly decreased.Many Florida plants were rock phosphate,but the western production amounts to only 3,000 to 5,000 tons a year.In 1916 it was only 1,700 tons.Use of phosphate rocks for sustainable agriculturePhosphate rock (PR) is a general term that describes naturally occurring mineral assemblages containing a high concentration of phosphate minerals.The term refers to both unbeneficiated phosphate ores and concentrated products.Sedimentary deposits have provided about 80
