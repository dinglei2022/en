## Filtration Wikipedia
Filtration is any of various mechanical,physical or biological operations that separates solids from fluids (liquids or gases) by adding a medium through which only the fluid can pass.The fluid that passes through is called the filtrate.In physical filters oversize solids in the fluid are retained and in biological filters particulates are trapped and ingested and metabolites are retainedVisual Encyclopedia of Chemical EngineeringThey are used in a wide range of appliions,and in many fields,as described below.Types Of Filter Media Strainers And Filter Cloth General Information Filter cloth or paper consists of different types of fibers layered to create pores that allow liquid to flow through while collecting solid particles.

Sand filters accomplish much of their treatment through biological processes.Sand filters are home to a variety of organisms,many of which contribute to treatment by consuming organic matter in the wastewater.Bacteria are the most abundant organisms in the filters,and they do most of the work.Filter Sizing for Swimming Pools Pool &amp Spa NewsThe example we've been using refers to characteristics of a sand filter.It's important to note that both DE and cartridge filters have notably lower filter rates.(Typically,highrate sand models filter water at a rate of 20 gpm per square foot,DE models work at 2 gpm sq.ft.and cartridge units at 1 gpm sq.ft.)
