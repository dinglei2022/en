## Modeling and Optimization of Cement Raw Materials Blending,
Cement raw material and cement clinkers mainly contain four oxides: calcium oxide or lime (CaO),silica (SiO 2),alumina (Al 2 O 3),and iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3) The cement clinkers quality is evaluated by the above four oxid Hence,ingredient ratio of cement raw material will affect the quality and property of cement clinker significantly
