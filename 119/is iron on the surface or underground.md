## Mining Wikipedia
Mining techniques can be divided into two common excavation types: surface mining and subsurface (underground) mining.Today,surface mining is much more common,and produces,for example,85% of minerals (excluding petroleum and natural gas) in the United States,including 98% of metallic ores.Fe and Mn in groundwater oregon.govorganic matter depletes the oxygen in the water and the iron dissolves as Fe 2+.Under these conditions,the dissolved iron is often accompanied by dissolved manganese or hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg smell).When this water is pumped to the surface,the dissolved iron reacts with the oxygen in
