## Is it Safe to Connect Aluminum and Copper Wiring
Aluminum wiring is sometimes found in older houses,and people often become anxious about connecting it with copper wiring in extensions,unsure of whether it is safe or efficient to do so.They are actually correct to be worried about this,as the uniting of the two metals can cause a chemicalIdeal 65 Purple Twister AluminumtoCopper Wire ConnectorThese Ideal 65 Purple Twister AluminumtoCopper Wire Connectors (2Pack) feature hexagonal heads for easy installation by hand or with a standard nut driver.Aluminumtocopper twiston connector Corrosionresistant compound penetrates corrosion buildup on aluminum conductors for conductivity and cool connections

## Do copper and aluminum gutters connect without problems
To mix dissimiliar metals will cause a galvanic reaction which will accelerate the decay of the metals.This is not only true of aluminum when mixed with copper but also of galvanized metals when mixed with copper.Stainless steel,and bronze is pretty inert and so is lead.Metal Flashing Choices buildingadvisorWith metal flashing,roofing,or any metal building components,the safest strategy is not to mix metals that come in direct contact with one another.Use aluminum flashing and fasteners in contact with aluminum,copper flashing and copper nails with copper roofing,gutters,etc.

## Antiseize: copper or aluminumbased? Mixing OK?
May 19,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32The choice between copper and aluminum is determined by the metals involved in the mating,plus by temperature.Now realistically,for cycling,the choice of aluminum or copper is really irrelevant.Heat will never be an issue,and the anti seize function is still delivered by either metal for basically any metal ever encountered in cycling.Copper &amp Aluminum?
