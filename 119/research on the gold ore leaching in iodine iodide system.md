## RECOVERY OF GOLD FROM ELECTRONIC WASTE BY
The aim of this research is to investigate the possibility of iodineiodide gold recovery from goldplated metal,which is a waste product of the electronic industry.Leaching experiments were carried out in solutions,containing 25 g l 1 iodine and 100 g l 1 KI,under room temperaThermodynamic and kinetic of iodine iodide leaching inIt can be seen from the discussed literature data that halogenide leaching of gold,and in particular iodide leaching,from goldcontaining materials is an alternative to the cyanidation process [18,19].Ideally,the lixiviant should be cheap or recyclable,selective,nontoxic and compatible with downstream recovery processes [20].

Iodine iodide gold leaching also has an advantage that the leaching system could be operated in a wide pH range (pH 2 to 10) [8],whereas the cyanide leaching should be operated under relatively restricted alkaline conditions (pH 10 to 11).Iodine iodide gold leaching is however disadvantageous in the high cost for both iodine and iodide [9].Research on the Gold Ore Leaching in IodineIodide SystemIodineiodide leaching gold ore is a promising method alternative to cyanide leaching.In this paper,Eh—pH diagram of AuII2H2O system was established through calculating the equilibrium potentials of the main chemical reactions based on the thermodynamic data of the actual iodide leaching of gold system.

## Alternative lixiviants to cyanide for leaching gold ores
The iodide iodine system does not normally oxidize metal sulfides such as chalcocite and pyrrhotite therefore,avoiding excessive reagent consumption in a potential goldprocessing plant (Hiskey and Qi,1991).Consequently,it might be appropriate for treating ores containing sulﬁdic minerals.Iodide—thiocyanate leaching system for gold SpringerLinkThe leaching of gold by thiocyanate solutions is performed at pHs between 1 and 2,which allows the use of iron(III) as an oxidizing agent.Thermochemistry of thiocyanate systems for leaching gold and silver ores,in: Monhemius A.J.(1994) Iodide—thiocyanate leaching system for gold.In: Hydrometallurgy '94.Springer,Dordrecht.DOI
