## The Art of Talc Flotation for Different Industrial
Talc occurs in the form of veins or lenses in many localities in South and Central Eastern Desert of Egypt (EGSMA,1991 MQA,2004).Generally,talc is obtained by either open pit or underground mining.The cost of overburden removal in open pit mining is a major factor in talc mining and waste rock to ore ratios of 40:1 are not uncommon.Talc Production APM Automation SolutionsBefore flotation process the ore goes through primary grinding in ball mill to obtain milled ore,impurities are removed in a cascade of flotation cells.Talc concentrate slurry is thickened in settling tanks (slurry) before drying.The concentrate Talc is dried by pressure filters.The resulting filter cake is an intermediate product.

## What is Talc? Industrial Minerals Association North
Talc ores also differ according to their mineralogical composition (i.e.the type and proportion of associated minerals present).They can be divided into two main types of deposits: talcchlorite and talccarbonate.Talcchlorite ore bodies consist mainly of talc (sometimes 100%) and chlorite,which is hydrated magnesium and aluminium silie.ore dressing and extraction talc nighttrailchapter 11 appliions of ore microscopy in mineral technology.The extraction of specific valuable minerals from their naturally occurring ores is variously termed &quotore dressing,&quot &quotmineral dressing,&quot and &quotmineral beneficiation.&quot For most fine l ayer silica tes such as kaolin.talc.
