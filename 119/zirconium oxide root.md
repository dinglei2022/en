## Resistance induction in cucumber and direct antifungal
Zirconium oxide nanoparticles (ZrONPs) were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to induce root rot resistance in cucumber and direct antifungal activity against Rhizoctonia solani.Resistance induction was investigated using realtime polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) and the effect of ZrONPs on the growth of cucumber plants was investigated.Dental Implants Downtown Dallas TX Dallas Dental ArtsNew technology has enabled us to replace teeth with highperformance ceramic zirconium oxide dental implants in place of titanium.Significantly less plaque tends to form on zirconium oxide ceramics.This reduces the risk of periimplantis,cardiovascular disease,and stroke.

## Zirconium dioxide Wikipedia
Zirconium dioxide (ZrO 2),sometimes known as zirconia (not to be confused with zircon),is a white crystalline oxide of zirconium.Its most naturally occurring form,with a monoclinic crystalline structure,is the mineral baddeleyite.A dopant stabilized cubic structured zirconia,cubic zirconia,is synthesized in various colours for use as a gemstone and a diamond simulantDeciding for ceramic dental implants Intelligent DentalMar 23,2010&nbsp&#0183&#32Zirconium oxide implants have outstanding mechanical properties,good stability,a high biocompatibility and a high resistance to scratching and corrosion.Zirconium oxide is ivory in color making it similar to the color of the natural tooth,which is important for restoring teeth in the mouth especially in the front teeth.Furthermore its
