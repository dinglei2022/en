## The rheological,mineralogical and chemical characteristic
Due to ionexchange,the original (Ca) or (Na Ca)bentonites are converted into (Na)bentonite by Na 2 CO 3.Alkali activation creates an active bentonite with a high swelling capacity and increased plasticity to be used as drilling muds.Lagaly (1989) investigated the effect of soda addition on the rheological properties of bentonites.The(PDF) Activation of (Na,Ca)bentonites with soda and MgOAlso,lower Ô¨Åltration In soda activation,soda ash powder was added to the initially losses were obtained with the combined activation of soda and MgO.moisturized bentonite samples and kneaded till all the bentonite had Although soda only activation did not yield high viscosities,it reacted with soda.
