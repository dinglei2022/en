## Modulus of Elasticity of Concrete Civil Engineering
Modulus of Elasticity of Concrete.Modulus of Elasticity of Concrete can be defined as the slope of the line drawn from stress of zero to a compressive stress of 0.45f' c.As concrete is a heterogeneous material.The strength of concrete is dependent on the relative proportion andConcrete WikipediaHighearlystrength concrete is designed to hydrate faster,often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking.The strength of concrete changes (increases) for up to three years.It depends on crosssection dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation.

The elastisitymodulus or Emodulus is a property of a material (like concrete or steel) whichs tells how much tension is needed to make it a little bit longer or shorter (when you pull at 2 ends of a steal beam it'll be a bit longer then when you press it together).Strength of Concrete (PSI) ProMatcherConcrete Strength: What is the Compressive Strength of Concrete? The strength of concrete is measure in terms of pounds per square inch (or PSI).PSI is a measure of compressive strength,or the ability of the material to carry loads and handle compression.1.) 25003000 PSI Most concrete has a PSI rating of 2500 to 3000.

To design a concrete mix of the desired strength with available materials,the strength of cement is required at 7 days (IRC:442008) 4 or at 28 days (IS:102621982) 5.Based on the strength values of cement,w c ratio is directly read from the available charts given in IRC44 &amp IS10262.Calculate WaterCement Ratio in Design of Concrete MixIn general terms w c ratio means,how much water is required for the particular mix.We all know that the watercement ratio will directly affect the strength of concrete.The strength of concrete either increases or decreases,will generally depend upon the w c ratio.
