## Interaction of Flotation Cell Operating Variables
• Chemistry and cell design had been identified as the major variables affecting ink removal efficiency and yield losses • Flotation cells were being operated over a range of conditions where consistency and air input were used as a means to control performance,but the relationship between these variables was not well understoodUS4055485A Method for improving clay brightness.A method for brightening a kaolin clay wherein an aqueous dispersion is initially formed of said clay,which dispersion is blunged and conditioned and the resultant slurry thereupon subjected to a froth flotation treatment to remove titaniferous impurities.The purified product from the froth flotation treatment is thereupon subjected to magnetic separation by passing such product through a.
