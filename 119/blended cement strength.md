## Standard Specifiion for Blended Hydraulic Cements
This specifiion pertains to blended hydraulic cements for both general and special appliions,using slag or pozzolan,or both,with portland cement or portland cement clinker or slag with lime.These cements are classified into two types: Type IS which is portland blastfurnace slag cement and Type IP which is portlandpozzolan cement.Camp Logan CementCamp Logan Cement Works,Inc.is one of the largest producers of precast concrete step treads in the United States.Our precast cement steps fit both wood and steel
