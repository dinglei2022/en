## Civil Engineering: Compressive strength of concrete cube TEST
Compressive strength of concrete cube TEST Compressive strength of concrete depends on many factors such as watercement ratio,cement strength,quality of concrete material,and quality control during production of concrete etc.Test for compressive strength is carried out either on cube or cylinder.Various standard codes recommendStrength development in concrete understandingcementMeasurement of concrete strength.Traditionally,this is done by preparing concrete cubes or prisms,then curing them for specified times.Common curing times are 2,7,28 and 90 days.The curing temperature is typically 20 degrees Centigrade.After reaching the required age for testing,the cubes prisms are crushed in a large press.

## Crushing Concrete Cube or Cylinder at 28 days Quality
Apr 01,2018&nbsp&#0183&#32Concrete elements are designed on the basis of a 28day cube's crushing strength.A 28day cube's strength actually represents the characteristic strength of the concrete.It is mandatory to test the concrete cubes or cylinders at the age of 28 days as per almost all building code requirements.Relation between Concrete Cube and Cylinder StrengthMay 13,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32The Compressive strength test will result in a compressive load on the cube and the cylinder during the test procedure.This process will result in the Lateral Expansion of the sample which will result in the Poisson's ratio effect.The figure1 below shows the compressive testing arrangement of a cube.
