Magnetite is a rock mineral and one of the main iron ores,with the chemical formula Fe 3 O 4.It is one of the oxides of iron,and is ferrimagnetic it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself.It is the most magnetic of all the naturallyoccurring minerals on Earth.Naturallymagnetized pieces of magnetite,called lodestone,will attract small piecesCan a mineral have both cleavage and fracture? Yahoo AnswersJul 18,2011&nbsp&#0183&#32Fracture occurs in all minerals even ones with cleavage.Fracture is the characteristic mark left when a mineral chips or breaks.Cleavage and fracture differ in that cleavage is the break of a crystal face where a new face (resulting in a smooth plane) is formed,whereas fracture is the &quotchipping&quot shape of a mineral.
