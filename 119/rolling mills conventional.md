## Bar and Wire Rod Mill Steel Plantech
Using a block mill,which drives multiple rolling mills and has been used on 100m s class wire rod lines,as the bar steel finishing mill,will achieve speeds far beyond the finishing speed of about 20m s that was the limit of conventional mills.Rolling using ultrahard rolls provides advantages such as precise measurements and enhancedSteel millA steel mill or steelworks is an industrial plant for the manufacture of steel.It may be an integrated steel works carrying out all steps of steelmaking from smelting iron ore to rolled product,but may also describe plants where steel semi finished casting products (blooms,ingots,slabs,billets) are made,from molten
